At this time, for opening remarks and inductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Good morning, and thank you, Nora. Welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Bill and Sam, let me remind everyone that should today\u2019s call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management\u2019s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today\u2019s press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning\u2019s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today\u2019s release. This morning\u2019s call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be made available later today. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Good morning. In the face of the highest surge yet of the COVID-19 pandemic, we finished the year with strong financial results in the fourth quarter. These results were driven once again by highly acute inpatient volumes, coupled with solid cost management. In the quarter, our hospitals provided care to 56,000 COVID-19 inpatients, a 40% increase over the third quarter. Since March, we have delivered care to 122,000 inpatients with the virus, representing 8% of total admissions. Currently, our hospitals continue to treat many patients with COVID-19. Census levels fortunately have begun to decline over the past few weeks. Revenues in the fourth quarter grew by $770 million or 5.7% over the prior year. This increase was driven by growth in inpatient revenues, which were up 12%. Revenue per admission grew 16%, while admits were down 3.4%. As mentioned, the acuity within our inpatient business was higher as reflected in both case mix index, which increased almost 7%, and length of stay, which grew by 6%. Outpatient revenue continued to lag as volume declined across most categories. We attribute many of these declines to the swell in COVID activity we serve, causing many patients to defer care. Outpatient revenues were down 4%. On the cost side, our teams continue to perform well. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the company grew on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, we experienced some upward pressure on labor costs due to challenges related to nurse staffing, which were caused mostly by demands related to the COVID-19 surge that occurred across most hospitals in the country. With respect to supply costs, we incurred increased drug costs related to the growing utilization of remdesivir and personal protective equipment costs. Diluted earnings per share increased 33.7% in the quarter to $4.13. For the year, diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales, as well as losses on debt retirement, grew 10.6% over 2019 to $11.61. Before I provide our outlook on 2021, I want to reflect on 2020. Just like many others, this past year was clearly a remarkable year for HCA Healthcare on multiple fronts. For us, however, I believe it will be seen also as a pivotal year. Across many dimensions, we improved our enterprise capabilities, which should allow us to support our local health systems better and enhance their abilities to provide higher quality care with greater efficiency. More importantly, we demonstrated an organizational ability to respond quickly and effectively to possibly the greatest challenge the company has ever experienced. And now, I believe we are emerging on the backside of this event stronger and better positioned to grow and drive value for our stakeholders. We did this while staying true to our mission throughout the process, and we could not have made these improvements without the unwavering commitment and excellent execution shown by the 285,000 colleagues and 50,000 physicians who make up HCA Healthcare. I want to thank them for their tremendous work, compassion and service to our patients and others in their communities. Currently, our teams are working diligently to vaccinate as many people connected to our health system as possible. To date, we have vaccinated approximately 200,000 colleagues, physicians, first responders and other individuals critical to the delivery of health care services. As we push forward into 2021, our overall outlook for the year remains generally consistent with the early perspectives we provided last quarter. While many aspects of our business, including the impact of the pandemic, remain difficult to predict, we believe the guidance that we are providing today is reasonable. We also believe that, together, our growth plan and capital deployment plan, which was announced in today's earnings release, should enhance long-term shareholder value. Because of the decisive actions we took at the onset of the pandemic and the solid results we produced in 2020, our company is now in a stronger financial position. This strength allows us to deploy sufficient capital resources to both plans while still maintaining ample balance sheet capacity to use for other strategic opportunities that may develop, including acquisitions. As part of our growth plan, we continue to find ways to strengthen our position locally and nationally. Some highlights are as follows. This past year, we acquired a 40% interest in a telemedicine company, which we believe has capabilities that can accelerate our program. We have committed significant capital to develop new and expanded inpatient rehab bed capacity in Florida, which recently eliminated certificate of need requirements certificate of need requirements in this service. And finally we have partnered, in many instances, with marquee physicians across the company to grow programs horizontally and vertically in key services. Our objective is still to be the provider system of choice in the communities we serve. Our strategic approach to accomplishing this goal has two overarching components. First, develop comprehensive health systems locally that deliver high quality, convenient care to our patients and second, support these networks with our unique enterprise capabilities and economies of scale. This blended model supported with strong execution has served us well over the past few years, as market share has reached an all-time high, using the most recently available data. But we are pushing for more. We have constructed a set of strategic initiatives that are underway and designed to deliver a better experience for our patients and improve the company's future performance. These efforts include seeking ways to utilize our network and expand into upstream or downstream business opportunities, including identifying different approaches to optimizing our portfolio of assets, we are investing more in technology to enhance quality outcomes for our patients, advance our operational effectiveness and drive efficiencies. And finally, we are finding ways to capitalize on the diverse footprint that we have by partnering with other companies to accelerate these initiatives. One example of our efforts to partner is the recent announcement we made to invest in a domestic PPE production company, which will be based in Asheville, North Carolina, this entity will supplement other supply chain sources, we have for procuring sufficient PPE for our colleagues. In 2021, we plan to increase our capital spending by approximately $850 million. This step-up is expected to mostly support our growth plans. Additionally, we have approximately $3.3 billion of other growth projects under construction that we expect to be operational this year or next. This pipeline includes capacity expansion projects at various hospitals, two new hospitals and additional outpatient facilities, mainly ambulatory surgery centers, freestanding emergency rooms and physician clinics. To round out our capital plan, our Board of Directors approved reinstating the quarterly dividend at $0.48 per share, while also increasing the authorization for a share buyback program. Bill will provide more details on these items and others in his comments. We are incredibly proud of our colleagues in the company's accomplishments in 2020, which included returning or repaying early over $6 billion of CARES Act funds to the federal government. Our performance this past year, gives us greater confidence to believe that we will be able to navigate successfully through future challenges as well. As we continue to honor our mission, we will remain focused on delivering high quality care to our patients, supporting our colleagues and physicians, responding to the vital role we play in the communities we serve and creating value for our shareholders. And now we'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Rutherford: Great, Thank you Sam and good morning, everyone. I'm going to walk through our 2021 guidance, and then touch on our capital allocation plan, including our announcement this morning to reinstate our dividend, and share repurchase program. The 2021 guidance outlined in our release this morning is consistent with our broader commentary, we provide on our third quarter call. We anticipate our inpatient admissions to grow approximately 2% to 4% over 2020, as reported results. And this would equate to about a 1% to 3% below 2019 levels. We expect our outpatient volumes to grow from 2020 levels but to track below 2019 as well. We expect our revenue per equivalent admission to be flat to down slightly with our 2020 level. This is mainly driven by expected declines in COVID activity throughout the year and loss of supplemental COVID funding. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be consistent with our as-reported 2020 full year level and range between 19% and 20%. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is between $10.3 billion and $10.9 for 2021. Earnings per share is expected to range between $12.10 and $13.10 for 2021. Also, we expect interest expense of approximately $1.6 billion and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. I would like to share a couple of other thoughts regarding our 2021 guidance as we think about our 2020 performance and results. The COVID pandemic and the various surges we have seen had a significant effect on our operating results throughout the year. As we have mentioned previously, we expect to continue to serve COVID patients throughout 2021. And while it is difficult to predict how the future cycles of this pandemic will occur, at this point, we anticipate our COVID volume to be heavier in the first half of the year and then hopefully will decline in the second half of the year as broader segments of the population receive a vaccination. We do expect some recovery of demand and deferred volume as the COVID activity lessens. It is difficult to predict the progression of the pandemic during 2021, but we believe our baseline assumptions are reasonable at this point. Let me speak briefly to some cash flow and balance sheet metrics, along with our capital allocation decisions. First, as a result of numerous measures we took in 2020, the cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet position of the company are in a very strong position. We finished 2020 with cash flow from operations of $9.2 billion. After our capital spend of $2.8 billion, the first quarter dividend of $150 million and non-controlling interest distributions of $625 million, our free cash flow was $5.6 billion for the year. Our debt balance declined $2.7 billion from our year-end 2019 levels, and we have approximately $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.0 X at the end of the year after netting out available cash. All of this is after returning or repaying early over $6 billion of provider relief funds and accelerated Medicare payments that we discussed on our third quarter call. Our 2020 cash flow metrics were benefited by deferred payroll taxes of approximately $700 million, which will begin to be repaid in later 2021, as well as great working capital management by our teams. The -- for 2021, we\\ anticipate cash flow from operations to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. As we evaluated our 2021 finance plan and considered our capital allocation strategies, we recognized our current position and outlook for 2021 presents an opportunity to find the optimum balance of investing capital to drive growth, position the balance sheet to execute on strategic M&A opportunities as they may present and returning value to our shareholders through reinstated dividend and share repurchase programs. We entered 2021 positioned to execute on all of these objectives. So as mentioned in our release this morning, our 2021 finance plan calls for the following. We anticipate capital spending to approximate $3.7 billion in 2021. This represents an approximately $850 million increase over 2020. Our Board of Directors declared a $0.48 dividend to be paid in the first quarter. This represents over an 11% increase from the quarterly dividend level that we suspended in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. Our Board of Directors also authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. We had approximately $2.8 billion remaining on our prior authorization. As a result, the company currently has $8.8 billion in total authorization. Consistent with our past programs, we have no defined time period to execute on the share repurchase authorization, but we anticipate executing over the next 12 to 18 months, with the majority expected to be completed in 2021, subject to market conditions. In addition to these actions, we are making an adjustment to our historical leverage target. Since 2013, we've had a stated leverage target to operate at a leverage ratio between 3.5 times and 4.5 times. Given our current leverage position is below that range and with our outlook going forward, we are lowering our expected leverage target to be between three times and four times, and we expect to run at the mid to low end of this range in the foreseeable future. We believe all of these actions represent a balanced capital philosophy that allows the company to continue to invest in our existing facilities to drive growth, position us well to explore strategic acquisitions as they may become available and provides the opportunity to drive long-term value. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark and open it up for Q&A.\nMark Kimbrough: Okay. Thank you, Sam and Bill. Nora, would you give directions on getting into the Q&A and remind everyone, please, to ask one question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to get a little bit more color on how you were thinking about, as volumes normalize, how the margins look on that volume returning, just because this year you benefited -- last year, you benefited from higher acuity payer mix benefited as the volumes returned? Is it going to be lower acuity, worse payer mix? How are you thinking about how that all comes together when you think incremental margin, not volume?\nBill Rutherford: Yeah Kevin, this is Bill. Let me take first stab at that. We recognize, we've been running high margins in the last half of the year. And as you stated and as we've said previously, that's largely due to the acuity that we've seen, the higher COVID activity, and a favorable payer mix going forward. We said in my commentary that we expect margins to range between 19% and 20%. The midpoint, obviously, will be 19.5%, which is where we finished full year 2020. We do believe as COVID declines throughout the year and we begin to see return of our historical volumes that, that will settle out. And we see that in our revenue per adjusted admission commentary that I gave as well. So it really is a matter of timing of when that occurs. But as we look forward -- and this year, we've been benefited by the acuity and the payer mix in terms of our commercial volume declines lower than our Medicare volumes, I think that will eventually settle out and return to maybe what our historical norms have been.\nSam Hazen: Let me add to that comment. This is Sam, Kevin. I think one thing, as I mentioned, we're pushing for more with respect to growth. We're also pushing ourselves with respect to resiliency and finding ways again to leverage economies of scale inside of HCA, giving us opportunities possibly to sustain this. That's our management challenge. We're obviously not there yet, but we have opportunities, we believe, inside of our financial resiliency program to advance that initiative. The second thing I would tell you is our investments and our advancing of technology is another opportunity for us to find more profitability within our existing revenue base. We have a lot of variation. We have a lot of opportunities to create more timely decisions and ultimately drive more efficiencies and better patient outcomes. And so technology and economies of scale continue to present opportunities for us to improve profitability across the organization. I don't know exactly where that lands, to Bill's point, but we do see certain initiatives yielding certain value for us over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nOperator: Gary Taylor, your line is open.\nGary Taylor: I'm sorry. Can you hear me now?\nSam Hazen: Yes. Yes, you're good.\nGary Taylor: Okay. I'm sorry. I'm going to ask two questions in case I strike out on the first one. The one I wanted to get after, if, Bill, if you had any comments on just EBITDA progression for the year, whether that looks like sort of what we're used to normal kind of first quarter and fourth quarter being highest. Obviously, I listened to your comments about margin and how COVID might normalize. If I don't get anything on that, I just wanted to ask about on the labor front, if you had any views on how the Biden administration plan to raise the minimum wage, how that might impact you and if any of that was incorporated in the guidance or could be accommodated in the guidance.\nSam Hazen: Okay. Let me -- Gary, this is Sam. I would swing and miss on your first one because, like Bill said, we -- we're trying to judge the pandemic and the implications of the pandemic, and it's been variable as you have seen over 2020, and we expect more variability with it. Our belief is, generally speaking, the latter part of the year will hopefully be a situation where we have a rebound in normal care and that some of the deferral of care, which we know has taken place over the past year, will start to surface in a more noticeable way. With respect to minimum wage, HCA has a living wage policy that had implemented approximately two years ago or actually advanced two years ago where we have different levels of minimum wage established based upon the cost of living. So, for example, in San Jose, California, the cost of living is much greater. Our minimum wage threshold in that particular market would be well north of $15 per hour. But in El Paso, Texas, as an example, it's lower because the cost of living in El Paso, Texas, is much lower than San Jose. And our floor on that program is $12.50 per hour, adjusted again to local market conditions. So we have a number of markets that are above $15 per hour already and others that are approaching it, but our floor for everybody is $12.50. In addition to that, we obviously have to be competitive with the marketplace as it relates to service workers or whatever the case may be. And our competitive wage program and our compensation programs are embedded in that. And in many instances, they are above the floor also. As it relates to a global $15 per hour federal policy on the wages, it's a minimal impact on the company because of the program that we already have in place.\nGary Taylor: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning. I'll move away from guidance. Maybe two more detailed questions. Where do you stand today on deferred procedures in light of the surge? And hopefully, that's rolled over now. And are you starting to see any kind of change in the Medicare or any of the government mix now that the surge is starting to roll over nationally, or are you seeing this rollout in the vaccine increasing? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Let me give you some general progression on COVID in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the first two months in the quarter we were ramping up COVID activities. October was the low point. November was higher, and then December was almost 50% of our COVID activity in the quarter. That continued into January, which is even higher census levels for COVID in December. We have proven that we can manage through COVID surges, and I'm immensely proud of our teams and how they've responded to the pressure points from one facility to the other, from one community to the other. And so we continue to manage through that. As part of our management process in responding to the communities in an appropriate way, we have to manage the intake process with respect to transfers into our facilities at times and elective care at times. Those are dialed up, dialed down as needed. And we've told our teams that we expect you to manage that activity conservatively so that we can respond to people in need whenever they need our services. And that's been our approach. So during December and also January, we had to manage down the intake into our facility so that we could deal with the COVID surge that we were experiencing. We have relaxed that over the course of the first part of this year as our census levels, as I mentioned in my comments have declined over the past few weeks. And it's too early, Frank, to know exactly what the recovery is going to be within Medicare population or other services and so forth. And we will just have to wait and see exactly how that plays out. But to Bill's point, we expect the first part of the year to be still more COVID activity than the last half. And the last part of the year to be, hopefully, a recovery in the certain levels of deferred care that, again, we know has taken place.\nFrank Morgan: Any way to measure that deferred volume?\nSam Hazen: No. No.\nOperator: Next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just -- I want to just piggyback off of some of the comments that Sam and Bill made during their prepared remarks, expressed some interest, Sam, I think in looking at upstream and downstream opportunities. I know we mentioned the Florida Rehab opportunity. Just trying to understand exactly what you're talking about there. I know people are talking about things like behavioral on the downstream might be of interest on upstream. I don't know whether you're referring to maybe even start to think about taken some risk or what that involves? But -- and Bill mentioned strategic deals, usually when you talk about strategic deals being a possibility, that's bigger than a one-off hospital. So I think when I think about capital deployment, I'm wondering what you guys are talking about, if you could flush it out a little more when you're referencing those types of upstream, downstream and strategic deal opportunities?\nSam Hazen: A.J., this is Sam. Let me give you some sense of how we're thinking about our provider system. It's not necessarily a new thought, but it's one that we have advanced over the course of this year. Our provider system model, which we like to term the HCA flywheel, it's been very consistent in how we think about it, how we plan, how we resource and how we hold ourselves accountable over the past decade, has served us incredibly well, as I mentioned in our comments. And we have challenged ourselves to understand what else is available to us as a result of that flywheel in that system. And we believe that \u2013 and we've proven it in certain categories. We have as a classic example in markets where we didn't have certificate of need that we have been able to integrate that service. When a patient needs rehab, we've been able to internalize that patient in our system and deliver value for the patient and value for our system as we build out that service line. We see other opportunities in post-acute in certain markets and maybe even beyond certain markets. We see opportunities again in behavioral health where we have delivered value in that category. It's not really post-acute, but again, it's connected to our system. A lot of our patients have behavioral health needs, many of which we can take care of, but there are opportunities for us to add programs and add capacity in some markets to deal with some of the mental health challenges that exist across the country. With respect to upstream, where we see opportunities is with telemedicine. We see a lot of opportunities upstream with telemedicine. Obviously, it's creating a new access point for patients as they interact with telemedicine and physician offices, but we also see inside of telemedicine other value chains that exist within that particular platform. And again, we took an interest in what we believe to be an incredibly well-run organization that has already done some work with HCA, but we see opportunities to use our footprint their capability to create a better solution for telemedicine. We think that can enhance delivery of in-hospital medicine with better physician coverage, more efficient physician coverage and ultimately better outcomes for our patients. So we see a value there. And for many of our physicians, we see an opportunity to attach them to this telemedicine platform and create an opportunity for them to be a service to other non-HCA facilities. So that's an example of telemedicine that we were approaching. With respect to strategic opportunities, I think people don't fully understand how many different components we have inside of HCA Healthcare. There are clearly a portfolio of services, of markets and facility types. And when we look inside of our portfolio of offerings, we see opportunities to create more strategic value with aspects of our portfolio that are outside of the normal hospital. We see opportunities to create new strategic relationships with other entities that we believe can help us accelerate our initiatives, and we, at the same time, accelerate their position, so strategic partnerships are available to us. We learned a lot about that during COVID. And then finally, we have opportunities, we believe, to create financial value with certain transactions because these assets are potentially worth more outside of HCA than they are inside of HCA. And if we can secure strategic value or a certain relationship that allow us to accelerate our initiatives, there may be opportunities for us to co-venture or something else even with those assets. So that's what we're referring to. We have a number of initiatives and analyses underway. I don't know exactly where all of those are going to land, but that's what we're talking about.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe explain a little bit on that last question around risk, but are you starting to see any impact of physician alignment with payers and sort of other large MSOs? And thinking about markets like South Florida, maybe Texas for you. Is this just more of a Medicare Advantage phenomenon? Are you seeing some impact in the commercial segment? Are you being presented of opportunities to take risk?\nSam Hazen: Well, let me speak to physician alignment in general. I think that is our wheelhouse. We are a very physician-friendly, customer-oriented organization with respect to physicians. We have almost 50,000 physicians who are affiliated with HCA in some form or fashion. Some of those relationships are through MSO relationships. Some of those relationships are, as it relates to institutional providers when the physicians are taking risk. Our fundamental approach to physicians are to give them voice inside of HCA, to make sure we have the clinical capabilities, nursing, technology, subspecialty support that they need, number two; number three, to be efficient in taking care of their patients; and then number four is to prove to them that we can help them grow their practice. That's been our model. That will continue to be our model in the future. And we believe that's a winning formula when executed at a detailed level. As it relates to certain opportunities with risk, we do have some of our physicians taking risk in certain specialties or certain categories. That's not large scale across our organization, but it does happen. As we think about the future and managed care relationships, I will tell you, we have advanced our payer relationships. We're roughly 90% contracted for 2021, over 50% contracted for 2022, again, continuing at similar trends to the past few years. We have structurally advanced our relationships with HICS payers this past year. We're in a much better position with HICS access. And as the Biden administration continues to push on the Affordable Care Act as the solution for uninsured, which we believe is the right solution, we should be in a strong position as a result of the improvements in contracting. So managed care is not a one-size-fits-all for 43 different markets. Healthcare is still local at some level. We think we're advantaged because of national capabilities within our local systems and we will adjust to each market condition appropriately to deal with risk relationships, other type of relationships needed in order to drive value for our organization. Most of the risk, to your question, is in Medicare Advantage. It hasn't spilled over in any significant way to commercial. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. On capital deployment, I understand the 3 to 4 range that you're guiding for and that you're running at the midpoint to low end of that range. So a multipart question. Is it safe to assume that all free cash flows will be going to share repos, and if EBITDA grows that you'll lever up to maintain those ratios? Will you get investment great credit if you're on at the low 3s on leverage? And how much share repo is assumed in the 2021 guidance?\nBill Rutherford: Pito, thank you. Pito, this is Bill. Thank you. Yes. At a current level, you could probably assume most, if not all, of our free cash flow will be dedicated to share repurchase. But as we've said, we have ample capital capacity ending the year, both in terms of cash on the balance sheet, as well as access to our short-term revolvers and bank commitments on there. So we've got capacity to execute, as I said, on the majority of the share repurchase, and then we'll evaluate the market conditions as they present to fine-tune the cadence of that. As we said, we believe lowering the leverage ratio is the right thing to do given where we are today and what our outlook is. And we do anticipate running at the mid to low end of that as we execute on all of our capital philosophies. And I think that leaves us in a very strong position to pursue any acquisitions that may present themselves, as Sam talked about. So I think all of those are part of our comprehensive plan.\nPito Chickering: So just a sort follow-up, how much share repo do you assume in your 2021 EPS guidance? And do you think you guys can get to intonate credit at this current leverage ratio?\nSam Hazen: Yes. Thanks. So our range in our EPS guidance provides accommodation that we can accomplish and will accomplish the majority of our share repurchase program. In terms of investment-grade rating, we're just going to have to continue our positive discussions with the rating agencies. As you know, our secured credit facilities are already at the investment grade. In terms of getting the whole company upgrade, we'll just have to wait to see. I think to wait to see. I think the agencies are expecting us to state a range and commit to that area, and we'll have to see how they evaluate it relative to investment grade going forward. What I can tell you is, we have ample access to the market and we believe at reasonable rates. And so we're generally comfortable with our position today.\nBill Rutherford:  Hey Pito, in the earnings release this morning, there is a supplemental non-GAAP disclosure on the guidance piece, which gives you the weighted average shares for the year. So you can kind of use that as your starting point, understanding that share repo will take place throughout the year, obviously, and that's a weighted number.\nPito Chickering: Great. Thank you so much guys.\nOperator: Next question is from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning\nScott Fidel: Interested if within the 2021 guidance, obviously, there's a lot of impact from mix around the revenues per adjusted admission. So just would be interested if you could walk us through maybe the average underlying rate update assumptions that you're thinking about for commercial, Medicare and Medicaid? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yeah. Scott, there's always a lot of variables in that. As Sam mentioned, we've got good visibility into our commercial contracting at comparable rates have been. Our Medicare rates probably is in that 1% to 2% level as we've seen going forward, maybe a little north of that, depending on how some of the specifics fall out. The rest of our acuity is going to be impacted just by the decline in COVID, as we've talked about, that's brought a higher acuity. And then we do receive some supplemental funding for COVID, the DRG add-ons and some of the versa and some of the other things that may have delayed some sequestration cuts that we don't anticipate continuing throughout the entire year. So, all of those are our factors, when we talk about our revenue per equivalent admission discussion. I'll also say that, if we hold where we are in 2020, it still represents about a 10% growth where we finished 2019. So we think our estimates are reasonable at this point.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi Bank. Your line is open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to -- Hey. I just want to go back to the labor side of things. I thought you managed it pretty well, but your commentary suggests greater pressure. So just hoping you can give us a little more detail on sort of wage growth, turnover competition and maybe what you've embedded into guidance for 2021 and maybe just how the acquisition or investment in Galen perhaps is that line item? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. Yeah. In my comments, I was referring to the fourth quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the third quarter as it related to the marketplace and some of the dynamics of the marketplace with, specifically for nursing, but secondarily, even for respiratory therapists. Obviously, when the whole country is in a respiratory distressed mode, because of the COVID surge that was occurring on a broad-based level, it put pressure on nursing. There were opportunities for nurses to go from one community to the other as it related to travelers and special pay programs and all that kind of stuff. So we were seeing a bit of velocity inside of our flexible staffing categories that we hadn't seen before and that required us to respond and so we did experience cost per FTE pressure in the fourth quarter that we didn't have in the third quarter and the surges that occurred more recently then. As we think about of 2021, we have advanced our cost per FTE assumptions somewhat, and we expect the marketplace to be a little bit more advanced than it has been historically. We think that will moderate as COVID moderates, because of the fact that there will be less sort of national demand for nurses across the country as COVID moderates over the course of the year. We do believe we have a robust agenda. We have to execute on that agenda. That includes better retention. That includes better recruitment and sourcing. And it also includes advancing our Galen strategy. We acquired Galen at the beginning of 2020. We have been limited in our ability to expand it because of the Department of Labor requirements where it imposed upon us a one-year moratorium on expansion. We have an expansion strategy that we will execute over the next two to three years, and we think that will create the continuum of nursing education that we want that will solidify our sourcing and training of nurses on the front end and then coupled with the clinical education programs that we've advanced over the past few years. Once a nurse is in our system, we can continue to develop their skill sets, their competency, their confidence and hopefully create an environment where nurses feel that they can be even more successful inside of an HCA facility.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Got a couple of numbers questions here. First, you guided to about 5% revenue and EBITDA growth at the midpoint year-over-year, but you mentioned 2% to 4% volume and flat pricing and margins. So I'm wondering if I'm missing something here in the components to get to 5% versus that, call it, 3%. And then you did a great job of managing costs in a tough 2020 environment. I'm just curious, how much flexibility do you think you still have here into 2021 given the uncertainty you talked about around volume and acuity and payer mix. Thanks.\nBillRutherford: Yeah. Justin, that volume was on the inpatient admissions, and we do anticipate recovery of the outpatient volume and revenue. So I would tell you that our revenue expectation is more in that 4% to 6%. And that, I think, lines up more with the mid-point of where our expectations are in terms of the EBITDA range. So I think it lines up pretty well, and we can talk further about that. In terms of room and the management costs we've talked about before of our resiliency plans. And as Sam mentioned in his commentary, we continue to search for every way we can to improve efficiencies out there. We are well into our stage two of our resiliency plans that are looking at longer term impacts, whether it be how do we use technology, automation is an example of some initiatives that we have going on that front. We have initiatives around support structures that we have throughout the organization. We have some call center discussions and optimization efforts. And we have a whole host of what I would call Stage 2 resiliency that we are going to continue to focus on and execute throughout 2021. And I think that can provide upside and protect a little bit buffers if we continue to see some upward pressure on the labor cost. So we do see continued opportunity for efficiency gains within HCA in a lot of our areas. Our supply chain teams continue to find opportunities to improve supply chain and utilization. Our revenue cycle teams as well as a host of other efforts going around the support structure of the enterprise.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, Bill. Can I just follow up with the\u2026\nBill Rutherford: Sure.\nJustin Lake: Can you give us a view on adjusted admissions then for 2021 that you built in the guidance that would include the outpatient?\nBill Rutherford: Yeah. So that would be more in that 4% \u2013 3% to 5% level.\nJustin Lake: Okay, perfect. Thanks for the help.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line from Whit Mayo with UBS. Your line is open.\nWhit Mayo: Hey. Thanks. I was just looking at the ER numbers, and I don't think the trends are terribly surprising to many of us, but I'm just curious how you're thinking about the ED, maybe not this year, but next year, and maybe more specifically, how you're reorienting how you manage the ED for the lower volumes. I just have to imagine there's some fundamental changes you guys are thinking about in terms of how you approach the ER moving forward.\nSam Hazen: Whit, let me speak to that. I think just as our inpatient population of patients this year is more acute, our emergency room population of patients is more acute. We have seen less declines in our upper level acuity categories for emergency room patients than we've seen in previous years. We have lost some lower acuity business. Of the total business that we lost, almost 70% of our declines have been in uninsured patients or Medicaid patients. So it's been interesting to me that the payer mix on a relative basis is actually slightly better, even though all categories are down. And then within the categories, it's more acute. As a company, I will tell you, we have sufficient ER supply beds at this particular juncture. We do have some pocketed opportunities, as I mentioned in my call -- my comments rather, around certain freestanding emergency rooms in certain markets where we see opportunities to serve the community better. And we will push on those. I think, today, we have roughly 125 or 130 freestanding ERs. We'll add another 12 to 15 over the next year or so. And those are very strategic with respect to certain markets. The emergency room is a very important component of our system, and it will remain that for really high-end care, trauma, burn, stroke, cardiac and so forth. Our patient satisfaction, it has been stable this year. It's been a difficult year in the emergency room. Our throughput continues to be reasonable, given some of the pressures we've seen with the acuity of patients. So we continue to be optimistic about the purpose and the role that our emergency rooms play to our system, but we have seen some change in overall mix, and that will put downward pressure on capital needs that we had historically, and we'll be able to utilize those capital capacity for other strategic opportunities or other components of our programs as we move through the next few years.\nBill Rutherford: Hey, Mark, let me correct something I said with Justin's question. Our AA guidance would be more four to six. I misspoke saying three to five. So I want to correct that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: A little bit about how you're looking at drug costs and revenues going forward and I'm particularly thinking at three points. One would be, policy and transparency sort of risks or headwinds those might present. Second would be, sourcing initiatives you may have underway. And the third might be, opportunities you see, whether its adding capabilities, et cetera. I appreciate it.\nBill Rutherford: Yeah. I missed the first part of that question, but it was regarding -- around drug costs and revenue and opportunities that we have. So our HPG teams do a great job in the sourcing of our pharmaceuticals, and I think that was clearly evident as we navigated the challenges of 2020. We actually have several initiatives going on around pharmacy procurement and sourcing of that. And so that's ongoing. We continue to work with our clinical teams as we have pharmacy optimization through our efforts as we've, over the years, consolidated a lot of our pharmacy supply chain. So we continue to see opportunity to advance in the supply chain of that. I don't really see material changes on the revenue side relative to pharmaceutical cost given what our Medicare reimbursement structures are as well as some of our commercial side. We are optimistic that there's going to be some revenue support of some of these COVID drugs that we've seen increased utilization, as Sam mentioned, the use of Remdesivir in his comments. And so I think it's pretty much fairly stable in that environment for us. Relative to transparency question on the pharmaceutical costs, we'll have to see. We have other price transparency. I'm not just sure if your question went in there that we continue to work on complying with the federal price transparency regulations and posting through those. But in terms of drug cost transparency, I don't see that having much of an impact on us going forward.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Good morning guys and congrats. Sam or \u2013 I guess I'll ask about the CapEx, right? I mean, it's up $850 million year-over-year. You're already spending an elevated amount of CapEx prior to this. So you called out ASCs and freestanding decent, among others. But how are we thinking about your long-term strategy in terms of continuing to ramp up CapEx? And then is there a goal in terms of kind of like penetration on freestanding EDs and ASCs in terms of number of units or percentage contribution that you said? And I guess last part is, from a returns perspective, how long do you normally see the investments before they yield in terms of growth or hitting your internal metrics?\nSam Hazen: All right, Brian. Let me see if we can hatch that one out for you.\nBrian Tanquilut: Sorry about that.\nSam Hazen: Let me speak generally to capital expenditures and where we are at this particular juncture, and then Bill can speak to the returns and how we analyze our capital spending from that standpoint. We are increasing our capital spending from 2020 level. We spent about $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion this past year. We're going to approximately $3.7 billion. We believe, as I mentioned in my comments, that a lot of this increase is going to some of our growth plan initiatives that we have. I think one thing that's very important to HCA Healthcare, and I hope you all appreciate and understand, is that we have a unique portfolio of markets that we serve. And when we look and score objectively the HCA markets that we serve compared to the national average with respect to certain economic indicators, roughly 2/3 of our portfolio of top markets outperforms, and in many instances, outperforms the national averages as far as forecast very significantly. So we still have growth opportunities embedded in our portfolio. That's the first thing I would tell you. Secondly, we are investing in our outpatient facility development. A reasonable point of reference is roughly every 1 of HCA's hospitals has 10 to 12 outpatient facilities attached to it. That's not exactly symmetrical from one institution, but when you look at the total outpatient facility network capabilities we have, it's roughly 2,200 to 2,500 outpatient facilities on top of 185 hospitals. So, it's roughly 10 to 12x the number of hospitals. We will continue to build on that because we believe that our patients deserve a convenient offering of facilities in our network. That doesn't require, fortunately, as much capital as the in-patient components of our spending. On the in-patient side, we have a handful of projects out there that we felt still made sense. Most of them are in these high-growth markets; Dallas, Texas; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida, places like that, that are on par with respect to demographic changes that appear to be occurring across the company. We don't want to miss those opportunities. Fortunately, a lot of our investments are long-lived assets and we're in a situation where some of the historical capacity that we put into the market will serve us well in the future. And then as we look at what's already in the pipeline, the $3.3 billion that I referred to, those are going to supplement our capacity. And then by then, hopefully, we're starting to get better visibility into what's happening with demand, and then we can adjust accordingly. So, at this particular point in time, we're not giving any additional long-term guidance on CapEx, but we believe we're in the zone of what we need in the near term to be responsive to the marketplace, competitive, provides the patient safe environment that we want, and ultimately, achieve our overall objectives. So, Bill, you want to speak too?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. I'll just mention briefly, I think for all of you following us, you know we have a very robust process for vetting and evaluating and validating assumptions in our growth capital projects that Sam talked about. In addition, we've got a very robust process where we do retrospective analysis after those projects have been completed and come online to evaluate our assumptions. And really, I think, to take away those retrospective assessments say that we achieve the majority a very high percentage of our returns. So, we're very confident in the assumptions that we use. In terms of time frame for returns, each project is a little bit differently, as might imagine. So, your out-patient, maybe your freestanding EDs, the returns come very quickly. Your new hospitals are maybe longer term returns and long-lived assets. Many times, your expansion projects on a hospital campus are dealing with pent-up demand. So, we can -- once we get through the construction and the opening, those returns come in a reasonable level. So, each project is a little bit different, but we have a really strong process to evaluating our assumptions and taking those into account as we approve projects going.\nSam Hazen: And let me just add to that. Even on our acquisitions, I think we had a strong year with respect to the company's acquisitions. So, the portfolio of acquisitions we have done over the past three or four years was solidly accretive. The margins continue to grow. They're into the low double-digits at this particular point. Our tax-exempt assets that we acquired in Savannah and North Carolina are ahead of models. And then we have a host of other outpatient acquisitions that we've integrated effectively. So, here, again, to Bill's point, we're doing retrospective analysis on our organic growth capital. And then at the same time, we're studying what's worked well and what hasn't worked well with our acquisition portfolio and continuing to refine that in a way that I think is very productive for the company. As we think about acquisitions, the point Bill made in his comments, we've created balance sheet capacity for that. We think -- we don't know when, that there's going to be nice opportunities for us to capitalize on that balance sheet capacity and build out more capabilities across the company. So we will be very opportunistic with respect to that given the position of the balance sheet and the performance and the confidence, we've gained with respect to our acquisition integration.\nOperator: All right. Your last question comes from the line of Jamie Perse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJamie Perse: Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on your inpatient and outpatient guidance for the year, you talked about that being below 2019 levels. I'm curious in the back half of the year, fourth quarter you're anticipating getting back closer to flat or even growth. And then any breakdown by medical or surgical, the cadence you're expecting throughout the year in that recovery? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yeah. This is Bill. As we said, we do anticipate as the COVID volumes decline, that will start to see return of our historical volume and maybe capture some of that pent-up demand. So, many variables at this point. It's hard to call and give you specifics in terms of timing of the year. Obviously, we have some comparable issues as we go through the last half of 2020 versus 2021. So we'll have to see that plays. But generally speaking, our broad commentary early on says that we expect our volume to recover, but still run slightly below 2019 level.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Jamie. Nora, I think we're finished here. Listen, we want to thank everyone for participating on today's call. As always, feel free to reach out and contact me, if you have further questions. Thank you so much. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Great, Thank you Sam and good morning, everyone. I'm going to walk through our 2021 guidance, and then touch on our capital allocation plan, including our announcement this morning to reinstate our dividend, and share repurchase program. The 2021 guidance outlined in our release this morning is consistent with our broader commentary, we provide on our third quarter call. We anticipate our inpatient admissions to grow approximately 2% to 4% over 2020, as reported results. And this would equate to about a 1% to 3% below 2019 levels. We expect our outpatient volumes to grow from 2020 levels but to track below 2019 as well. We expect our revenue per equivalent admission to be flat to down slightly with our 2020 level. This is mainly driven by expected declines in COVID activity throughout the year and loss of supplemental COVID funding. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be consistent with our as-reported 2020 full year level and range between 19% and 20%. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is between $10.3 billion and $10.9 for 2021. Earnings per share is expected to range between $12.10 and $13.10 for 2021. Also, we expect interest expense of approximately $1.6 billion and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. I would like to share a couple of other thoughts regarding our 2021 guidance as we think about our 2020 performance and results. The COVID pandemic and the various surges we have seen had a significant effect on our operating results throughout the year. As we have mentioned previously, we expect to continue to serve COVID patients throughout 2021. And while it is difficult to predict how the future cycles of this pandemic will occur, at this point, we anticipate our COVID volume to be heavier in the first half of the year and then hopefully will decline in the second half of the year as broader segments of the population receive a vaccination. We do expect some recovery of demand and deferred volume as the COVID activity lessens. It is difficult to predict the progression of the pandemic during 2021, but we believe our baseline assumptions are reasonable at this point. Let me speak briefly to some cash flow and balance sheet metrics, along with our capital allocation decisions. First, as a result of numerous measures we took in 2020, the cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet position of the company are in a very strong position. We finished 2020 with cash flow from operations of $9.2 billion. After our capital spend of $2.8 billion, the first quarter dividend of $150 million and non-controlling interest distributions of $625 million, our free cash flow was $5.6 billion for the year. Our debt balance declined $2.7 billion from our year-end 2019 levels, and we have approximately $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.0 X at the end of the year after netting out available cash. All of this is after returning or repaying early over $6 billion of provider relief funds and accelerated Medicare payments that we discussed on our third quarter call. Our 2020 cash flow metrics were benefited by deferred payroll taxes of approximately $700 million, which will begin to be repaid in later 2021, as well as great working capital management by our teams. The -- for 2021, we\\ anticipate cash flow from operations to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. As we evaluated our 2021 finance plan and considered our capital allocation strategies, we recognized our current position and outlook for 2021 presents an opportunity to find the optimum balance of investing capital to drive growth, position the balance sheet to execute on strategic M&A opportunities as they may present and returning value to our shareholders through reinstated dividend and share repurchase programs. We entered 2021 positioned to execute on all of these objectives. So as mentioned in our release this morning, our 2021 finance plan calls for the following. We anticipate capital spending to approximate $3.7 billion in 2021. This represents an approximately $850 million increase over 2020. Our Board of Directors declared a $0.48 dividend to be paid in the first quarter. This represents over an 11% increase from the quarterly dividend level that we suspended in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. Our Board of Directors also authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. We had approximately $2.8 billion remaining on our prior authorization. As a result, the company currently has $8.8 billion in total authorization. Consistent with our past programs, we have no defined time period to execute on the share repurchase authorization, but we anticipate executing over the next 12 to 18 months, with the majority expected to be completed in 2021, subject to market conditions. In addition to these actions, we are making an adjustment to our historical leverage target. Since 2013, we've had a stated leverage target to operate at a leverage ratio between 3.5 times and 4.5 times. Given our current leverage position is below that range and with our outlook going forward, we are lowering our expected leverage target to be between three times and four times, and we expect to run at the mid to low end of this range in the foreseeable future. We believe all of these actions represent a balanced capital philosophy that allows the company to continue to invest in our existing facilities to drive growth, position us well to explore strategic acquisitions as they may become available and provides the opportunity to drive long-term value. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark and open it up for Q&A. Yeah Kevin, this is Bill. Let me take first stab at that. We recognize, we've been running high margins in the last half of the year. And as you stated and as we've said previously, that's largely due to the acuity that we've seen, the higher COVID activity, and a favorable payer mix going forward. We said in my commentary that we expect margins to range between 19% and 20%. The midpoint, obviously, will be 19.5%, which is where we finished full year 2020. We do believe as COVID declines throughout the year and we begin to see return of our historical volumes that, that will settle out. And we see that in our revenue per adjusted admission commentary that I gave as well. So it really is a matter of timing of when that occurs. But as we look forward -- and this year, we've been benefited by the acuity and the payer mix in terms of our commercial volume declines lower than our Medicare volumes, I think that will eventually settle out and return to maybe what our historical norms have been. Pito, thank you. Pito, this is Bill. Thank you. Yes. At a current level, you could probably assume most, if not all, of our free cash flow will be dedicated to share repurchase. But as we've said, we have ample capital capacity ending the year, both in terms of cash on the balance sheet, as well as access to our short-term revolvers and bank commitments on there. So we've got capacity to execute, as I said, on the majority of the share repurchase, and then we'll evaluate the market conditions as they present to fine-tune the cadence of that. As we said, we believe lowering the leverage ratio is the right thing to do given where we are today and what our outlook is. And we do anticipate running at the mid to low end of that as we execute on all of our capital philosophies. And I think that leaves us in a very strong position to pursue any acquisitions that may present themselves, as Sam talked about. So I think all of those are part of our comprehensive plan. Hey Pito, in the earnings release this morning, there is a supplemental non-GAAP disclosure on the guidance piece, which gives you the weighted average shares for the year. So you can kind of use that as your starting point, understanding that share repo will take place throughout the year, obviously, and that's a weighted number. Yeah. Scott, there's always a lot of variables in that. As Sam mentioned, we've got good visibility into our commercial contracting at comparable rates have been. Our Medicare rates probably is in that 1% to 2% level as we've seen going forward, maybe a little north of that, depending on how some of the specifics fall out. The rest of our acuity is going to be impacted just by the decline in COVID, as we've talked about, that's brought a higher acuity. And then we do receive some supplemental funding for COVID, the DRG add-ons and some of the versa and some of the other things that may have delayed some sequestration cuts that we don't anticipate continuing throughout the entire year. So, all of those are our factors, when we talk about our revenue per equivalent admission discussion. I'll also say that, if we hold where we are in 2020, it still represents about a 10% growth where we finished 2019. So we think our estimates are reasonable at this point. Yeah. Justin, that volume was on the inpatient admissions, and we do anticipate recovery of the outpatient volume and revenue. So I would tell you that our revenue expectation is more in that 4% to 6%. And that, I think, lines up more with the mid-point of where our expectations are in terms of the EBITDA range. So I think it lines up pretty well, and we can talk further about that. In terms of room and the management costs we've talked about before of our resiliency plans. And as Sam mentioned in his commentary, we continue to search for every way we can to improve efficiencies out there. We are well into our stage two of our resiliency plans that are looking at longer term impacts, whether it be how do we use technology, automation is an example of some initiatives that we have going on that front. We have initiatives around support structures that we have throughout the organization. We have some call center discussions and optimization efforts. And we have a whole host of what I would call Stage 2 resiliency that we are going to continue to focus on and execute throughout 2021. And I think that can provide upside and protect a little bit buffers if we continue to see some upward pressure on the labor cost. So we do see continued opportunity for efficiency gains within HCA in a lot of our areas. Our supply chain teams continue to find opportunities to improve supply chain and utilization. Our revenue cycle teams as well as a host of other efforts going around the support structure of the enterprise. Sure. Yeah. So that would be more in that 4% \u2013 3% to 5% level. Hey, Mark, let me correct something I said with Justin's question. Our AA guidance would be more four to six. I misspoke saying three to five. So I want to correct that. Yeah. I missed the first part of that question, but it was regarding -- around drug costs and revenue and opportunities that we have. So our HPG teams do a great job in the sourcing of our pharmaceuticals, and I think that was clearly evident as we navigated the challenges of 2020.

We are optimistic that there's going to be some revenue support of some of these COVID drugs that we've seen increased utilization, as Sam mentioned, the use of Remdesivir in his comments.

I'm not just sure if your question went in there that we continue to work on complying with the federal price transparency regulations and posting through those.

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "Good morning. In the face of the highest surge yet of the COVID-19 pandemic, we finished the year with strong financial results in the fourth quarter. These results were driven once again by highly acute inpatient volumes, coupled with solid cost management. In the quarter, our hospitals provided care to 56,000 COVID-19 inpatients, a 40% increase over the third quarter. Since March, we have delivered care to 122,000 inpatients with the virus, representing 8% of total admissions. Currently, our hospitals continue to treat many patients with COVID-19. Census levels fortunately have begun to decline over the past few weeks. Revenues in the fourth quarter grew by $770 million or 5.7% over the prior year. This increase was driven by growth in inpatient revenues, which were up 12%. Revenue per admission grew 16%, while admits were down 3.4%. As mentioned, the acuity within our inpatient business was higher as reflected in both case mix index, which increased almost 7%, and length of stay, which grew by 6%. Outpatient revenue continued to lag as volume declined across most categories. We attribute many of these declines to the swell in COVID activity we serve, causing many patients to defer care. Outpatient revenues were down 4%. On the cost side, our teams continue to perform well. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the company grew on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, we experienced some upward pressure on labor costs due to challenges related to nurse staffing, which were caused mostly by demands related to the COVID-19 surge that occurred across most hospitals in the country. With respect to supply costs, we incurred increased drug costs related to the growing utilization of remdesivir and personal protective equipment costs. Diluted earnings per share increased 33.7% in the quarter to $4.13. For the year, diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales, as well as losses on debt retirement, grew 10.6% over 2019 to $11.61. Before I provide our outlook on 2021, I want to reflect on 2020. Just like many others, this past year was clearly a remarkable year for HCA Healthcare on multiple fronts. For us, however, I believe it will be seen also as a pivotal year. Across many dimensions, we improved our enterprise capabilities, which should allow us to support our local health systems better and enhance their abilities to provide higher quality care with greater efficiency. More importantly, we demonstrated an organizational ability to respond quickly and effectively to possibly the greatest challenge the company has ever experienced. And now, I believe we are emerging on the backside of this event stronger and better positioned to grow and drive value for our stakeholders. We did this while staying true to our mission throughout the process, and we could not have made these improvements without the unwavering commitment and excellent execution shown by the 285,000 colleagues and 50,000 physicians who make up HCA Healthcare. I want to thank them for their tremendous work, compassion and service to our patients and others in their communities. Currently, our teams are working diligently to vaccinate as many people connected to our health system as possible. To date, we have vaccinated approximately 200,000 colleagues, physicians, first responders and other individuals critical to the delivery of health care services. As we push forward into 2021, our overall outlook for the year remains generally consistent with the early perspectives we provided last quarter. While many aspects of our business, including the impact of the pandemic, remain difficult to predict, we believe the guidance that we are providing today is reasonable. We also believe that, together, our growth plan and capital deployment plan, which was announced in today's earnings release, should enhance long-term shareholder value. Because of the decisive actions we took at the onset of the pandemic and the solid results we produced in 2020, our company is now in a stronger financial position. This strength allows us to deploy sufficient capital resources to both plans while still maintaining ample balance sheet capacity to use for other strategic opportunities that may develop, including acquisitions. As part of our growth plan, we continue to find ways to strengthen our position locally and nationally. Some highlights are as follows. This past year, we acquired a 40% interest in a telemedicine company, which we believe has capabilities that can accelerate our program. We have committed significant capital to develop new and expanded inpatient rehab bed capacity in Florida, which recently eliminated certificate of need requirements certificate of need requirements in this service. And finally we have partnered, in many instances, with marquee physicians across the company to grow programs horizontally and vertically in key services. Our objective is still to be the provider system of choice in the communities we serve. Our strategic approach to accomplishing this goal has two overarching components. First, develop comprehensive health systems locally that deliver high quality, convenient care to our patients and second, support these networks with our unique enterprise capabilities and economies of scale. This blended model supported with strong execution has served us well over the past few years, as market share has reached an all-time high, using the most recently available data. But we are pushing for more. We have constructed a set of strategic initiatives that are underway and designed to deliver a better experience for our patients and improve the company's future performance. These efforts include seeking ways to utilize our network and expand into upstream or downstream business opportunities, including identifying different approaches to optimizing our portfolio of assets, we are investing more in technology to enhance quality outcomes for our patients, advance our operational effectiveness and drive efficiencies. And finally, we are finding ways to capitalize on the diverse footprint that we have by partnering with other companies to accelerate these initiatives. One example of our efforts to partner is the recent announcement we made to invest in a domestic PPE production company, which will be based in Asheville, North Carolina, this entity will supplement other supply chain sources, we have for procuring sufficient PPE for our colleagues. In 2021, we plan to increase our capital spending by approximately $850 million. This step-up is expected to mostly support our growth plans. Additionally, we have approximately $3.3 billion of other growth projects under construction that we expect to be operational this year or next. This pipeline includes capacity expansion projects at various hospitals, two new hospitals and additional outpatient facilities, mainly ambulatory surgery centers, freestanding emergency rooms and physician clinics. To round out our capital plan, our Board of Directors approved reinstating the quarterly dividend at $0.48 per share, while also increasing the authorization for a share buyback program. Bill will provide more details on these items and others in his comments. We are incredibly proud of our colleagues in the company's accomplishments in 2020, which included returning or repaying early over $6 billion of CARES Act funds to the federal government. Our performance this past year, gives us greater confidence to believe that we will be able to navigate successfully through future challenges as well. As we continue to honor our mission, we will remain focused on delivering high quality care to our patients, supporting our colleagues and physicians, responding to the vital role we play in the communities we serve and creating value for our shareholders. And now we'll turn the call over to Bill. Let me add to that comment. This is Sam, Kevin. I think one thing, as I mentioned, we're pushing for more with respect to growth. We're also pushing ourselves with respect to resiliency and finding ways again to leverage economies of scale inside of HCA, giving us opportunities possibly to sustain this. That's our management challenge. We're obviously not there yet, but we have opportunities, we believe, inside of our financial resiliency program to advance that initiative. The second thing I would tell you is our investments and our advancing of technology is another opportunity for us to find more profitability within our existing revenue base. We have a lot of variation. We have a lot of opportunities to create more timely decisions and ultimately drive more efficiencies and better patient outcomes. And so technology and economies of scale continue to present opportunities for us to improve profitability across the organization. I don't know exactly where that lands, to Bill's point, but we do see certain initiatives yielding certain value for us over time. Yes. Yes, you're good. Okay. Let me -- Gary, this is Sam. I would swing and miss on your first one because, like Bill said, we -- we're trying to judge the pandemic and the implications of the pandemic, and it's been variable as you have seen over 2020, and we expect more variability with it. Our belief is, generally speaking, the latter part of the year will hopefully be a situation where we have a rebound in normal care and that some of the deferral of care, which we know has taken place over the past year, will start to surface in a more noticeable way. With respect to minimum wage, HCA has a living wage policy that had implemented approximately two years ago or actually advanced two years ago where we have different levels of minimum wage established based upon the cost of living. So, for example, in San Jose, California, the cost of living is much greater. Our minimum wage threshold in that particular market would be well north of $15 per hour. But in El Paso, Texas, as an example, it's lower because the cost of living in El Paso, Texas, is much lower than San Jose. And our floor on that program is $12.50 per hour, adjusted again to local market conditions. So we have a number of markets that are above $15 per hour already and others that are approaching it, but our floor for everybody is $12.50. In addition to that, we obviously have to be competitive with the marketplace as it relates to service workers or whatever the case may be. And our competitive wage program and our compensation programs are embedded in that. And in many instances, they are above the floor also. As it relates to a global $15 per hour federal policy on the wages, it's a minimal impact on the company because of the program that we already have in place. Let me give you some general progression on COVID in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the first two months in the quarter we were ramping up COVID activities. October was the low point. November was higher, and then December was almost 50% of our COVID activity in the quarter. That continued into January, which is even higher census levels for COVID in December. We have proven that we can manage through COVID surges, and I'm immensely proud of our teams and how they've responded to the pressure points from one facility to the other, from one community to the other. And so we continue to manage through that. As part of our management process in responding to the communities in an appropriate way, we have to manage the intake process with respect to transfers into our facilities at times and elective care at times. Those are dialed up, dialed down as needed. And we've told our teams that we expect you to manage that activity conservatively so that we can respond to people in need whenever they need our services. And that's been our approach. So during December and also January, we had to manage down the intake into our facility so that we could deal with the COVID surge that we were experiencing. We have relaxed that over the course of the first part of this year as our census levels, as I mentioned in my comments have declined over the past few weeks. And it's too early, Frank, to know exactly what the recovery is going to be within Medicare population or other services and so forth. And we will just have to wait and see exactly how that plays out. But to Bill's point, we expect the first part of the year to be still more COVID activity than the last half. And the last part of the year to be, hopefully, a recovery in the certain levels of deferred care that, again, we know has taken place. No. No. A.J., this is Sam. Let me give you some sense of how we're thinking about our provider system. It's not necessarily a new thought, but it's one that we have advanced over the course of this year. Our provider system model, which we like to term the HCA flywheel, it's been very consistent in how we think about it, how we plan, how we resource and how we hold ourselves accountable over the past decade, has served us incredibly well, as I mentioned in our comments. And we have challenged ourselves to understand what else is available to us as a result of that flywheel in that system. And we believe that \u2013 and we've proven it in certain categories. We have as a classic example in markets where we didn't have certificate of need that we have been able to integrate that service. When a patient needs rehab, we've been able to internalize that patient in our system and deliver value for the patient and value for our system as we build out that service line. We see other opportunities in post-acute in certain markets and maybe even beyond certain markets. We see opportunities again in behavioral health where we have delivered value in that category. It's not really post-acute, but again, it's connected to our system. A lot of our patients have behavioral health needs, many of which we can take care of, but there are opportunities for us to add programs and add capacity in some markets to deal with some of the mental health challenges that exist across the country. With respect to upstream, where we see opportunities is with telemedicine. We see a lot of opportunities upstream with telemedicine. Obviously, it's creating a new access point for patients as they interact with telemedicine and physician offices, but we also see inside of telemedicine other value chains that exist within that particular platform. And again, we took an interest in what we believe to be an incredibly well-run organization that has already done some work with HCA, but we see opportunities to use our footprint their capability to create a better solution for telemedicine. We think that can enhance delivery of in-hospital medicine with better physician coverage, more efficient physician coverage and ultimately better outcomes for our patients. So we see a value there. And for many of our physicians, we see an opportunity to attach them to this telemedicine platform and create an opportunity for them to be a service to other non-HCA facilities. So that's an example of telemedicine that we were approaching. With respect to strategic opportunities, I think people don't fully understand how many different components we have inside of HCA Healthcare. There are clearly a portfolio of services, of markets and facility types. And when we look inside of our portfolio of offerings, we see opportunities to create more strategic value with aspects of our portfolio that are outside of the normal hospital. We see opportunities to create new strategic relationships with other entities that we believe can help us accelerate our initiatives, and we, at the same time, accelerate their position, so strategic partnerships are available to us. We learned a lot about that during COVID. And then finally, we have opportunities, we believe, to create financial value with certain transactions because these assets are potentially worth more outside of HCA than they are inside of HCA. And if we can secure strategic value or a certain relationship that allow us to accelerate our initiatives, there may be opportunities for us to co-venture or something else even with those assets. So that's what we're referring to. We have a number of initiatives and analyses underway. I don't know exactly where all of those are going to land, but that's what we're talking about. Well, let me speak to physician alignment in general. I think that is our wheelhouse. We are a very physician-friendly, customer-oriented organization with respect to physicians. We have almost 50,000 physicians who are affiliated with HCA in some form or fashion. Some of those relationships are through MSO relationships. Some of those relationships are, as it relates to institutional providers when the physicians are taking risk. Our fundamental approach to physicians are to give them voice inside of HCA, to make sure we have the clinical capabilities, nursing, technology, subspecialty support that they need, number two; number three, to be efficient in taking care of their patients; and then number four is to prove to them that we can help them grow their practice. That's been our model. That will continue to be our model in the future. And we believe that's a winning formula when executed at a detailed level. As it relates to certain opportunities with risk, we do have some of our physicians taking risk in certain specialties or certain categories. That's not large scale across our organization, but it does happen. As we think about the future and managed care relationships, I will tell you, we have advanced our payer relationships. We're roughly 90% contracted for 2021, over 50% contracted for 2022, again, continuing at similar trends to the past few years. We have structurally advanced our relationships with HICS payers this past year. We're in a much better position with HICS access. And as the Biden administration continues to push on the Affordable Care Act as the solution for uninsured, which we believe is the right solution, we should be in a strong position as a result of the improvements in contracting. So managed care is not a one-size-fits-all for 43 different markets. Healthcare is still local at some level. We think we're advantaged because of national capabilities within our local systems and we will adjust to each market condition appropriately to deal with risk relationships, other type of relationships needed in order to drive value for our organization. Most of the risk, to your question, is in Medicare Advantage. It hasn't spilled over in any significant way to commercial. Thank you. Yes. Thanks. So our range in our EPS guidance provides accommodation that we can accomplish and will accomplish the majority of our share repurchase program. In terms of investment-grade rating, we're just going to have to continue our positive discussions with the rating agencies. As you know, our secured credit facilities are already at the investment grade. In terms of getting the whole company upgrade, we'll just have to wait to see. I think to wait to see. I think the agencies are expecting us to state a range and commit to that area, and we'll have to see how they evaluate it relative to investment grade going forward. What I can tell you is, we have ample access to the market and we believe at reasonable rates. And so we're generally comfortable with our position today. This is Sam. Yeah. In my comments, I was referring to the fourth quarter vis-a\u0300-vis the third quarter as it related to the marketplace and some of the dynamics of the marketplace with, specifically for nursing, but secondarily, even for respiratory therapists. Obviously, when the whole country is in a respiratory distressed mode, because of the COVID surge that was occurring on a broad-based level, it put pressure on nursing. There were opportunities for nurses to go from one community to the other as it related to travelers and special pay programs and all that kind of stuff. So we were seeing a bit of velocity inside of our flexible staffing categories that we hadn't seen before and that required us to respond and so we did experience cost per FTE pressure in the fourth quarter that we didn't have in the third quarter and the surges that occurred more recently then. As we think about of 2021, we have advanced our cost per FTE assumptions somewhat, and we expect the marketplace to be a little bit more advanced than it has been historically. We think that will moderate as COVID moderates, because of the fact that there will be less sort of national demand for nurses across the country as COVID moderates over the course of the year. We do believe we have a robust agenda. We have to execute on that agenda. That includes better retention. That includes better recruitment and sourcing. And it also includes advancing our Galen strategy. We acquired Galen at the beginning of 2020. We have been limited in our ability to expand it because of the Department of Labor requirements where it imposed upon us a one-year moratorium on expansion. We have an expansion strategy that we will execute over the next two to three years, and we think that will create the continuum of nursing education that we want that will solidify our sourcing and training of nurses on the front end and then coupled with the clinical education programs that we've advanced over the past few years. Once a nurse is in our system, we can continue to develop their skill sets, their competency, their confidence and hopefully create an environment where nurses feel that they can be even more successful inside of an HCA facility. Whit, let me speak to that. I think just as our inpatient population of patients this year is more acute, our emergency room population of patients is more acute. We have seen less declines in our upper level acuity categories for emergency room patients than we've seen in previous years. We have lost some lower acuity business. Of the total business that we lost, almost 70% of our declines have been in uninsured patients or Medicaid patients. So it's been interesting to me that the payer mix on a relative basis is actually slightly better, even though all categories are down. And then within the categories, it's more acute. As a company, I will tell you, we have sufficient ER supply beds at this particular juncture. We do have some pocketed opportunities, as I mentioned in my call -- my comments rather, around certain freestanding emergency rooms in certain markets where we see opportunities to serve the community better. And we will push on those. I think, today, we have roughly 125 or 130 freestanding ERs. We'll add another 12 to 15 over the next year or so. And those are very strategic with respect to certain markets. The emergency room is a very important component of our system, and it will remain that for really high-end care, trauma, burn, stroke, cardiac and so forth. Our patient satisfaction, it has been stable this year. It's been a difficult year in the emergency room. Our throughput continues to be reasonable, given some of the pressures we've seen with the acuity of patients. So we continue to be optimistic about the purpose and the role that our emergency rooms play to our system, but we have seen some change in overall mix, and that will put downward pressure on capital needs that we had historically, and we'll be able to utilize those capital capacity for other strategic opportunities or other components of our programs as we move through the next few years. All right, Brian. Let me see if we can hatch that one out for you. Let me speak generally to capital expenditures and where we are at this particular juncture, and then Bill can speak to the returns and how we analyze our capital spending from that standpoint. We are increasing our capital spending from 2020 level. We spent about $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion this past year. We're going to approximately $3.7 billion. We believe, as I mentioned in my comments, that a lot of this increase is going to some of our growth plan initiatives that we have. I think one thing that's very important to HCA Healthcare, and I hope you all appreciate and understand, is that we have a unique portfolio of markets that we serve. And when we look and score objectively the HCA markets that we serve compared to the national average with respect to certain economic indicators, roughly 2/3 of our portfolio of top markets outperforms, and in many instances, outperforms the national averages as far as forecast very significantly. So we still have growth opportunities embedded in our portfolio. That's the first thing I would tell you. Secondly, we are investing in our outpatient facility development. A reasonable point of reference is roughly every 1 of HCA's hospitals has 10 to 12 outpatient facilities attached to it. That's not exactly symmetrical from one institution, but when you look at the total outpatient facility network capabilities we have, it's roughly 2,200 to 2,500 outpatient facilities on top of 185 hospitals. So, it's roughly 10 to 12x the number of hospitals. We will continue to build on that because we believe that our patients deserve a convenient offering of facilities in our network. That doesn't require, fortunately, as much capital as the in-patient components of our spending. On the in-patient side, we have a handful of projects out there that we felt still made sense. Most of them are in these high-growth markets; Dallas, Texas; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida, places like that, that are on par with respect to demographic changes that appear to be occurring across the company. We don't want to miss those opportunities. Fortunately, a lot of our investments are long-lived assets and we're in a situation where some of the historical capacity that we put into the market will serve us well in the future. And then as we look at what's already in the pipeline, the $3.3 billion that I referred to, those are going to supplement our capacity. And then by then, hopefully, we're starting to get better visibility into what's happening with demand, and then we can adjust accordingly. So, at this particular point in time, we're not giving any additional long-term guidance on CapEx, but we believe we're in the zone of what we need in the near term to be responsive to the marketplace, competitive, provides the patient safe environment that we want, and ultimately, achieve our overall objectives. So, Bill, you want to speak too? And let me just add to that. Even on our acquisitions, I think we had a strong year with respect to the company's acquisitions. So, the portfolio of acquisitions we have done over the past three or four years was solidly accretive. The margins continue to grow. They're into the low double-digits at this particular point. Our tax-exempt assets that we acquired in Savannah and North Carolina are ahead of models. And then we have a host of other outpatient acquisitions that we've integrated effectively. So, here, again, to Bill's point, we're doing retrospective analysis on our organic growth capital. And then at the same time, we're studying what's worked well and what hasn't worked well with our acquisition portfolio and continuing to refine that in a way that I think is very productive for the company. As we think about acquisitions, the point Bill made in his comments, we've created balance sheet capacity for that. We think -- we don't know when, that there's going to be nice opportunities for us to capitalize on that balance sheet capacity and build out more capabilities across the company. So we will be very opportunistic with respect to that given the position of the balance sheet and the performance and the confidence, we've gained with respect to our acquisition integration."

At this time, for opening remarks and instructions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Kimbrough: Okay. Thank you, Julianne, and good morning. Welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; our CFO, Bill Rutherford, along with our CMO, Dr. Jon Perlin. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then will take questions. Bill will start with some comments on the quarter and then Sam will provide some thought or commentary around some observations that we\u2019re making today. Before I turn the call over to Bill and Sam, let me remind everyone that should today\u2019s call containing any forward-looking statements, they are based on management\u2019s current expectations. Numerous risk and uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today\u2019s press release and our various SEC filings. On this morning\u2019s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today\u2019s release. This morning\u2019s call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be made available later today. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional information on the quarter. You will note in our earnings release this morning, our reported adjusted EBITDA was slightly better than our preview. So, let me highlight some volume indicators and trends. Our same facility admissions declined 3.8% in the quarter. Within this, our Medicare admissions declined 7.6% from the prior year period, and our managed care admissions declined 0.7% from the prior year period. Our same facility admissions declined 3.7% in July, 5.2% in August, and 2.6% in September. Thus far in October, we\u2019ve seen continued improvement in our admission trend. The COVID increases we saw in the quarter began in July and stayed elevated for most of August. Due to this and as we have mentioned in previous settings, we voluntarily suspended elective procedures in over 100 of our hospitals for some period of time during the July and August surges. And this impacted, our surgical volume statistics. Same facility in-patient surgeries declined 6.8% in the quarter from the prior year period. They were down about 11% in July, down about 9% in August and were within 1% of prior year levels in September. Same facility hospital-based outpatient surgeries declined 7.5% in the quarter from the prior year period with about 12% decline in both, July and August, but September saw some growth over prior year. Our ambulatory surgery center volume had a similar result with a decline of 4.7% for the quarter occurred, which occurred primarily in July and August, while September\u2019s volume was about 1% over prior year. The surgical volume results were influenced by business of surgical days in any given month and September did have one more surgical day than the prior year. But, we wanted to share some of the results we saw throughout the quarter to highlight the impact of our voluntary suspension of the elective procedures. Emergency room visits trends were consistent throughout the quarter, which declined 20.3% from the prior year period. Our level 1 and 3 visits declined about 29% and our level 4 and 5 visits declined about 14%. Admissions to the emergency room were down about 2.5%. The higher acuity and revenue intensity results we saw in the quarter offset the impact of these volume declines. Our same facility net revenue per adjusted admission increased 14.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year period. There were three factors that contributed to this result. One is a level of COVID-19 patients we served in the quarter. As we previously mentioned, we served close to 40,000 inpatient COVID cases in the quarter or about 8% of our total admissions. These patients have a higher acuity than average and a longer length of stay, which resulted in a higher consumption of resources. Due to this, revenue per admission is a little bit higher than our average. Second, within our non-COVID patients, we saw a higher acuity patient as those patients presenting for service have been in higher acuity areas such as neurology, cardiology, and oncology and the lower acute services were slower to return. Our non-COVID case mix index increased approximately 5% over the prior year. Lastly, as we mentioned earlier, our maintenance care mix of inpatients as our Medicare volume was slightly slower to recover. Our teams continue to do an excellent job managing our cost structure during these pandemic cycles, which benefited our performance in the quarter, and our labor, supply and other operating costs as a percent of revenue, all showed improvement as compared to the prior year period. Before I conclude, let me speak briefly to some cash flow balance sheet and liquidity metrics. As we mentioned in our earlier calls, the Company took a number of measures early in this pandemic to enhance our operational and financial flexibility. Because of these actions and other factors, we were able to announce that we will return or repay early $6 billion of CARES Act funding, including $4.4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments, and $1.6 billion of provider relief funds we have received. We are working with various government agencies to execute these payments. We expect to fund the entire amount from available cash in future cash flow from operations. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had approximately $6.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet and $7.7 billion of capacity under our credit facilities. Our debt to EBITDA leverage was 2.67 times as of September 30, 2020, after netting out available cash. Cash flow from operations was $2.7 billion for the quarter, which includes the effect of approximately $300 million of stimulus payments that will be part of our repayment. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $12.8 billion, which includes approximately $6.1 billion of government stimulus funds. Also, as mentioned in last quarter\u2019s call, we have reduced the Company\u2019s planned capital expenditures and anticipate our full year 2020 capital spending to be about $3 billion. In short, we believe even after considering the plan returns $6 billion of CARES Act funding, the cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet position of the Company provides us the financial capability and flexibility to navigate these unprecedented times, and we will continue to look for opportunities to create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Good morning. The disciplined operating culture of HCA Healthcare, and the ability to take full advantage of what our size and enterprise capabilities have to offer have produced remarkable performance for the Company this year. These attributes, along with the great people we have in our organization, and the steadfast commitment we have to our mission have allowed us to deliver value consistently and at high levels for all of our stakeholders. As demonstrated again in this quarter\u2019s results, we continue to show resiliency, both operationally and financially, while also enhancing our overall position across the communities we serve. For the past couple of years, we\u2019ve used the third quarter\u2019s earnings call to provide some early thoughts about the upcoming year. In those years, we obviously had a more stable environment, economically, politically and operationally. While always difficult to predict our business with precision, today\u2019s environment with all of its uncertainty makes it particularly challenging. We plan to provide you with more details in January, when we complete our planning process for 2021. By that time, we will have a few more months of experience that we can hopefully use to give a better indication of our thoughts regarding certain components of our business. With that being said, we\u2019re beginning to formulate some preliminary perspectives around a few aspects of our business. And I want to share those with you this morning. With respect to volume, given the unusual volatility we\u2019ve seen in 2020 with COVID-19 surges, mandatory and voluntary suspension of elected business and intermittent recovery periods, we currently plan to use 2019 volumes as a starting reference point for early 2021 planning purposes. Since the pandemic began, we have had very few months, mainly September and October that we believe are indicative of somewhat stable activity. Notwithstanding, we have some observations from these two months, and we are using them to inform our current thinking. First, we believe, we will continue to treat COVID-19 patients throughout 2021. Over the last two quarters, COVID-19 patients have represented approximately 6% of our admissions. Recognizing that there are many variables that could affect next year, at this point, we believe it is reasonable to estimate around 4% to 5% of our 2021 admissions could be related to the virus. This factor suggests continued high levels of acuity in our overall mix of inpatient business, which should provide some support for current inpatient revenue trends. It is difficult however to know if the various governmental reimbursement programs for providing care to COVID-19 patients will continue through 2021. Overall, we believe demand for inpatient admissions next year will be down from 2019, approximately 2% to 3%, but again, with the mix being more acute. On the outpatient side, as compared to 2019, we anticipate emergency room visits will be down in 2021, similar to this year. But like our inpatient business, we expect it to be more acute, which should drive higher revenue per visit, offsetting some of the volume decline. For outpatient surgeries, we are expecting some recovery over current levels, but we expect volumes to be down slightly. With respect to managing operating costs, which has been a key part of our solid results this year, we have continued confidence in our team\u2019s ability to hold many of the gains they have made across the different expense categories. In those areas where we anticipate some pressure, we believe we have future resiliency actions that can help offset some of these challenges. Collectively, these factors lead us to think that our preliminary expectations for adjusted EBITDA for 2021 could look similar to the Company\u2019s original 2020 guidance, but likely with a slightly wider range of results. Clearly, there are additional factors that could influence these perspectives and expectations, including but not limited to, the economy could worsen and impact payer mix, the election result to bring adverse changes to healthcare policies, and the pandemic could fluctuate or affect our results in ways that we cannot anticipate. We will evolve our thinking accordingly as we gain a better understanding of these factors. We believe as I stated in my comments a few weeks ago that we have proven we can meet the challenge of this pandemic. We also believe the Company will be able to navigate successfully through future challenges as well. Since the onset of this historic event, we have improved many clinical, operational, technology and organizational capabilities. We believe these improvements coupled with the financial flexibility we possess, should provide us with a platform to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. Once again, I want to thank our colleagues and our physicians for their incredible work during this year. We are fortunate to have such capable people in our organization. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark for questions. Thank you.\nMark Kimbrough: Thank you, Sam, thank you, Bill. Julianne, we\u2019re ready for questions, now if you\u2019ll provide information on the queue, and instructions. And let\u2019s please keep your questions to one, so we may hear as many people into the queue as possible. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Whit Mayo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: Thanks. I just wanted to -- I got actually two-part question. I just want to be clear on the message for 2021. I appreciate all the details. Just the current thinking is admissions down 2% to 3% in 2019 versus -- I\u2019m sorry, in 2021 versus the 2019 baseline. And also just wanted to build on the wanted to build on the $3 billion that you\u2019re spending on capital this year, it implies kind of a step-up in the first -- in the fourth quarter up to about $1 billion. Is that a good run rate to think about next year? Just was wondering if there\u2019s any comments on 2021. Thanks.\nMark Kimbrough: Sam?\nSam Hazen: So, on the admission estimation, that\u2019s our best thinking at this particular point in time with, we are believing based upon September and October and maybe even June, to some degree that we will not see some of the lesser acute inpatient admissions that we had seen in previous years, but we will continue to see acute -- more acute type patients who need significant care throughout 2021, just as we\u2019ve seen in many months this year as we\u2019ve gone through this COVID period. So, that\u2019s our thinking. Obviously, as we get deeper into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll have months that are reflective enough of what we\u2019ll call stable activity that will allow us to inform that thinking even further. And if we have adjustments to that thinking, we will clearly update you in our fourth quarter call in January.\nMark Kimbrough: Bill, do you want to talk to capital?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. On capital, as you know, our fourth quarter typically runs a little bit higher. I don\u2019t necessarily think the fourth quarter alone is indicative of go-forward run rate. We\u2019re obviously in the \u201821 planning and we\u2019ll finalize our capital expectations. I think, it likely will land somewhere north of where we are in 2020 but less than what our original historical spend was for this year. So, we\u2019ll give you some detail as we get into next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Back on the 2021 EBITDA guidance assumptions for a minute. You talked about sort of the volume trends a little soft than 2019 levels but at higher acuity. Can you let us know what payer mix you\u2019re assuming in the guidance, how it differs versus what you saw in the third quarter? And if you dig into the margin side, you saw some pretty good margin leverage on OpEx this quarter. Can you walk us through what assumptions you\u2019re making on salaries and benefits, and OpEx within that guidance?\nSam Hazen: We don\u2019t have those details at this particular point in time to share, Pito. We need to finish our planning process as we typically do in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re trying to give you some general sense of where we see things. There\u2019s obviously puts and takes on every line item on our income statement as always. And as we get further into the fourth quarter and refine our thinking on each of those categories, we\u2019ll give you some range of expectations around those metrics in our planning process in our fourth quarter earnings release.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gary Taylor from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Two-part question as well. One, Bill, wondered, if you could tell us 2019, what emergency room was as a percent of either total revenue or total outpatient revenue, just so we can sort of think about the headwind that you\u2019ve baked in there. And then, the other part is, I guess, clearly, we\u2019ve seen that the worst financial result for HCA comes from when the facilities are empty because you\u2019ve deferred surgical business, and there wasn\u2019t COVID. Now, you\u2019re managing much better sort of simultaneously the COVID ebbs and flows with your surgical business. So, the question is, as investors look forward, as COVID cases increases, do we think that\u2019s a positive or negative for EBITDA, or do we think that still just allows you to manage your overall EBITDA trajectory in a fairly tight range?\nSam Hazen: Let me answer a couple of questions here, Gary, and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Bill. I think, it\u2019s important to understand that two-thirds, two-thirds of our ER visit decline in the third quarter was either uninsured patients or Medicaid. And the balance of our visits were patients who were more acute, as one would expect, and that they delayed possibly or deferred care and were more sick when they came to the emergency room. So, I think it\u2019s a very important element of our ER business. We don\u2019t know exactly how that\u2019s going to play out, but that has been the pattern throughout most of the pandemic. So, Bill, do you want to answer the other question?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. On the COVID, as you\u2019ve identified, volume will fluctuate. It\u2019s hard to isolate that population by itself, if you will, because as we mentioned and intended to highlight in our trends, it also has an impact on some of them were elective as it fluctuates. But, we think we\u2019ll have a level of COVID patients that we\u2019re going to serve throughout 2021, as Sam mentioned in his comments. And I think we\u2019re prepared to manage through those fluctuations as they present.\nOperator: Your next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Just one point of clarification, and then a question. One, so, you\u2019re saying the guidance you gave coming into the year for EBITDA sort of is general range, maybe a little wider. I\u2019ve got various data points, but I just want to make sure I\u2019m looking at the right number. I had $10.25 billion to $10.65 billion was your original guidance. And then, for the question, I guess, I\u2019d just ask, you mentioned future resiliency actions that could be taken as some of the other cost reductions or other aspects of the business, the benefits you\u2019ve seen in the second half here fade a little bit. Maybe expand a little bit on that and how significant are those opportunities as you look out into next year.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. A.J., first, on your first one, yes, I\u2019ll confirm your numbers are correct from what our original 2020 guidance was.\nSam Hazen: And then, A.J., on the question around future resiliency, Bill is leading this effort, but I want to give you some strategic approach that we\u2019re taking because we believe that there are significant opportunities inside of the approach, and we are executing on some of those as we speak. And we still have capacity in these initiatives as we push forward. But, we have grown the organization over the last decade, I\u2019ll call it, organically. And through that organic growth, it has yielded results that we think are very powerful for the Company over the past decade and have positioned the Company very well. As a matter of fact, our market share at the end of the first quarter right before COVID hit or even at the end of March period is at an all-time high. We think our overall positioning in the marketplace has improved over these seven months in many circumstances. And if we move forward, we should be in an even better position. But with respect to our financial resiliency program, we have looked and challenged ourselves at a number of areas where we have redundancies and/or duplications in our operations. Today, for example, we have multiple call centers. We think we have opportunity to create consolidation in those areas and create efficiencies, better outcomes for our patient and ultimately a better use of overall Company resources. We have similar opportunities in our lab services. Throughout the pandemic, we\u2019ve enhanced our lab capabilities, and it\u2019s enlightened us on opportunities to advance our lab services in a way that we think can yield efficiencies and better access to lab services and so forth, doing it more efficiently. And so, we have those type of examples. We\u2019re challenging how we\u2019re structured to see again if we have redundancies in our structure and whether or not there are better ways to service the field and produce outcomes on that front. And then, what I\u2019m most excited about is our technology initiative where we have opportunities to advance technology even further in the Company and ultimately deliver a better patient outcome, but at the same time, support our physicians, support our management and deliver our services more efficiently. So, we think these work streams to have opportunities for the Company that we can use to offset any pressures that might serve us in 2021 and on into 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRalph Giacobbe: I just want another clarification here. So, you said inpatient down 2% to 3% on sort of the core 2019, then plus COVID of sort of that 4% to 5%. So, net volume, call it, up 2%. I just wanted to frame that if that\u2019s right. And then, I want to go back to competitive -- I just want to go back to the competitive positioning. In terms of if you\u2019re able to figure out if you\u2019re drawing sort of more of that acute population in your markets any more than before? And if so, why that would be the case?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Ralph, on the first one, I think, the 2% to 3% is just broad guidelines that we wanted to provide you with that would include all of our patients, including the COVID within that. But, obviously, we\u2019re going to finalize our planning here and share with you more thoughts as we get into our year-end call. But, at 2% to 3% is our broad planning, including all patients.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. As it relates to the competitive positioning, we don\u2019t have any data on the second and third quarter yet that would give us market share information and provide insights into whether we had more patients in our hospitals than our competitors. Intuitively, I don\u2019t think that was the case because all the systems in these markets were under community pressure to respond to COVID. What I\u2019m reacting to is certain outpatient opportunities, certain physician opportunities, certain program development opportunities that we think have evolved that positions our organization, we believe, better than what it was at the beginning of this year. And we will continue to, as I mentioned on the preview call, continue to move forward on those components of our development in order to enhance our overall position.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Just a few quick numbers questions here. First, on EBITDA, similar to 2020 is kind of the EBITDA number you talked about. Should we assume revenues in that general ballpark as well in terms of what you gave us for 2020? And then, can you give us the overall payer mix numbers for 3Q? And finally, any October volume numbers you can share? I know you said volume improved there in terms of volume, surgeries, ER visits in October.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Justin, this is Bill. On the revenue side, it\u2019s a little early. We know the composition of the revenue is changing as we\u2019ve seen over these past couple of quarters. So, I don\u2019t want to give parameters on the revenue yet till we complete our planning. On payer mix for the quarter, very quickly, our Medicare was roughly -- our inpatient payer mix was roughly 45%, our managed care, 24% and then self-pay was around 8% for the quarter. And then, what was the third one?\nJustin Lake: The October volume numbers, anything early on surgery volumes, ER visits, inpatient, outpatient\u2026\nBill Rutherford: Obviously, a sequential improvement in our admissions. As you saw, we finished the September at 2.6%. October is probably 1.5% down, a little better from where we ended September. But obviously, it\u2019s still early in the cycle.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJosh Raskin: So just again, I sort of hate to harp on this, but the 2021 guidance of, let\u2019s call it, $10.45 billion at the midpoint, that coming despite pretty significant improvement on the margin side, margin is up 500 basis points, excluding CARES Act in the quarter. And so, I\u2019m curious, is there some offset? It doesn\u2019t sound like revenues are going to be materially different than what you guys were assuming. So, is there some offsets, some costs that are coming back? And maybe specifically in that, supply expense has been down more than 50 basis points, despite this higher acuity. So, is there some assumption that some of that comes back as well?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Josh, I think there\u2019s a couple of points. And there\u2019s obviously a lot of puts and takes, whether performances, our thinking into next year, and we haven\u2019t finalized it. One is, we know we do have some other government funding relative to COVID patients this year, whether it be the Medicare DRG add-on or the HRSA payments to recognize resources consumed by uninsured COVID. And I don\u2019t think we see those continuing too long into 2021. And again, I think, the purpose of our guidance was to give you our general thinking versus that we\u2019ve gone through a lot of calcs on each one of those inputs. And so, as we complete that, we\u2019ll go forward and give you our input in that. I think, again, I\u2019d reiterate, we\u2019re confident in the team\u2019s ability to hold many of our costs that we\u2019ve seen. And as Sam mentioned in his comments, to the extent that we have any new costs that may enter the system, we\u2019ve got resiliency plans that I think we can execute to help offset those. And I think, given the profile we\u2019re seeing, we feel generally reasonably comfortable with our current margin performance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFrank Morgan: Sam, I think, you said you didn\u2019t have any market share information yet around the different regions of the country. But, could you just give us some high-level perspective about the financial performance across HCA\u2019s enterprise in different areas of the country? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: I don\u2019t have it for the market share, Frank, for the second and third first quarter. We\u2019re obviously just processing the first quarter. I think, we had one of the strongest portfolio performance in years across HCA\u2019s 185 hospitals. 76% of our facilities had year-over-year EBITDA growth. So, we had very consistent performance across all of our divisions. To say one, we had a little bit of a challenge in the far west division, primarily because of our California hospitals and just the slow uptake in the activity in those communities. But our strength across the portfolio, it\u2019s very good, consistent. And I think it again reflects the power of our portfolio, the diversification of our portfolio, including even the service mix that we have inside of it. So, very strong portfolio performance for the Company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Just a two-part question for me. As I think about your guidance again, is that basically assuming that the economy stays where it is or you\u2019re not expecting any further degradation in unemployment? And then, I guess, just for Bill, with $6.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, how should you be thinking about buybacks and the dividend resumption at some point? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Let me start with that. And so again, I think, as we mentioned in our comments, the balance sheet and our cash flow gives us a lot of flexibility and I think, capability of managing through different cycles. We\u2019ve made -- haven\u2019t made any decisions on capital allocation at this point or resumption of the share repurchase or dividend. We will complete our planning in \u201821 and announce kind of what our plans are. As we\u2019ve said before, I think we have a pretty long history of having a balanced and disciplined approach to deploying our capital. And as we get some understanding of the market environment, we\u2019re looking for when is the right time to resume some of that but we haven\u2019t made any decisions at this point. About the economy?\nSam Hazen: I\u2019ll take that. This is Sam. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we\u2019re making these judgments off of our current read of economy, and we\u2019re not factoring in any kind of significant worsening of the economy. So, obviously, if the economy were to worsen, it could have an impact on our expected results as we\u2019ve indicated here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKevin Fischbeck: Just maybe I want to follow up on that one. But the first part being, as far as the guidance, are you assuming that COVID starts off at about these levels at the beginning of the year and then kind of gradually goes away because the core business improves throughout the year, or is this kind of a steady state kind of assumption? And just a follow-up on that last question about capital deployment. If next year\u2019s EBITDA is going to be more or less the same as this year\u2019s EBITDA was supposed to be, what are the markers you\u2019re looking for to get back to a normal capital deployment? I think with normal EBITDA, strong balance sheet, you\u2019d expect a normal [Technical Difficulty] on that, but what are you looking for?\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. I\u2019ll let Bill take the second question. With respect to the COVID assumption, our experience with COVID throughout the pandemic has been that it\u2019s choppy. There are going to be situations where COVID is up; there\u2019s going to be situations where COVID is down. We\u2019re trying to give you some estimation of the average that we\u2019re expecting. We are, at this particular point in time, balancing off what I call the floor. And we are not nearly as intense with the volume of patients today as we did in late July and early August. But, we are seeing a little bit of a rise, primarily in one market, and that\u2019s El Paso. And that\u2019s created a significant challenge in that community, but we only have two hospitals there. And at this particular point in time, we\u2019re able to support them appropriately. And with the actions that the community has just recently taken as well as what the governor has done to support that community, we believe that we should be in a reasonable situation there. So, we\u2019re not anticipating month-by-month estimations around COVID. We\u2019re just going to respond to it with the capabilities we\u2019ve developed. And we\u2019re estimating what we believe to be an overall metric that is likely to occur in 2021.\nBill Rutherford: And Kevin, this is Bill on the capital. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one unique trigger that we\u2019re looking for. I mean, we\u2019re obviously still going through these cycles. We want a couple more stable months to kind of firm up our assessments that we\u2019ve talked about. And part of our normal routine as we go through any year is to make those assessments, judge the environment we\u2019re in and make the right capital decisions. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to plan to do and we\u2019ll share with you our final thinking in our year-end call.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Gillmor from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Gillmor: I wanted to follow up on the resiliency topic and the technology capability Sam mentioned. I think, Sam said technology was potentially the most exciting area. I think, it\u2019s efficiency. And just hoping you could expand a little bit in terms of what that means, and if you had an example or two to conceptualize it for us?\nSam Hazen: Well, I\u2019ll give you a very specific example that we\u2019ve been able to use on two fronts this year. We have a system called NATE. NATE is a technology solution that gives us individual insight into every patient in our hospital right now. And that insight provides clinical metrics, it provides bed location, it provides certain metrics around what requirements the patient has with respect to, let\u2019s just say, ventilator management. And we\u2019ve been able to use those insights from this particular system to improve our ventilation management of COVID patients in a way that has reduced their length of stay on it and provided a much more efficacious outcome. So, that\u2019s just one example that reduces ICU days. It creates a lower length of stay for the patient and ultimately, a much better outcome. So, we see opportunities to advance this system. The second aspect of NATE that\u2019s proved to be very productive for us is capacity management, allowing us to position patients most efficiently within the facilities or even across our networks at time. So, this insight into our capacity management has allowed us to be, I think, more efficient at managing our beds and the turnovers, if you will, around those beds, providing better discharge planning and timing and then better utilization of existing assets. So, those are just two examples. We see opportunities beyond that as we\u2019ve had experiences with clinical initiatives, like our sepsis initiative in the past. But going forward, we see more on that particular platform.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: Quick question on capacity, and I\u2019m just interested in getting some color on what you guys are doing as far as being able to expand capacity in order to kind of recapture those avoided or deferred cases. And then what\u2019s the net impact as you think about the COVID protocols that you are having to deal with?\nSam Hazen: On capacity, I mean, we have multiple capacity metrics that we use to determine needs for capital. We have triggers around how many ER visits per bed, how many surgeries per surgical suite, what\u2019s the occupancy in our ICUs, what\u2019s the occupancy triggers inside of our med/surg bed in order to determine capital needs. Currently, the Company is running about 70% utilization of its inpatient beds. Where we have capacity today, which won\u2019t require the same level of capital, at least in the intermediate run is in the emergency room. With emergency room volumes being down some, we find ourselves in a situation where at a company level from one facility to the other, we may have issues. But at a Company level, we\u2019re running about 60% to 65% utilization of our ER beds currently. That\u2019s down from about 85% in 2019. So, we have the situation where our ER beds are flexible now, allowing us to accommodate more volume, if in fact, it presents itself. So, I don\u2019t see capacity as being a barrier to growth for us. We do have capital still in the pipeline that will ultimately add capacity to institutions that we believe needed. And those will be playing out over the rest of this year and on into 2021. And I think, the Company is in a solid capacity position today, generally speaking, maybe in the best capacity position we\u2019ve been in a number of years, given the circumstances. And so, from that standpoint, there\u2019s not any significant pressures. I don\u2019t remember what the last question was. Bill, do you...\nBill Rutherford: Yes. It was on the net effect of the COVID and the loss of those businesses. I\u2019d just say it\u2019s hard to really quantify and that\u2019s why we -- I tried to give you some of the trends we saw in the surgical volume. We do know and as we\u2019ve talked about before, we recaptured some of that, but we don\u2019t think we recaptured all of that. And so, the net effect is really hard to quantify. But, we\u2019ll continue to monitor our volume trends as they progress through the balance of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Mok: Hi This is Andrew Mok on for Steve. I just wanted to follow up on the slow ER volume recovery and expectations for a similar decline in 2021. Do you suspect that some of the ER volumes, especially on the lower acuity visits had left the hospital system permanently? How does that scenario impact your strategy and resource allocation from here? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam again. We don\u2019t know, to be honest with you. We\u2019re not anticipating a further decline in 2021. We\u2019re anticipating that the \u201820 decline as compared to \u201819 volume, that\u2019s the metric that we\u2019re reflecting here. As I just mentioned, we\u2019re running about 65% utilization of our emergency room beds across the Company, which gives us ample capacity to absorb growth, if growth resurfaces in this particular category of our business. If it doesn\u2019t, as I mentioned, we\u2019re anticipating that the ER patient that we do see is one that is in fact more acute. And so, the revenue per visit will actually be supported by the acuity of those patients. Whether or not they\u2019ve been lost forever? I don\u2019t know. Our business model is to have capabilities outside of the ER as we\u2019ve been investing in both, urgent care platforms over the years, telemedicine platform significantly during COVID and then our primary care platform as well. So, we have multiple platforms to stay connected to the patient. That\u2019s the important objective for us is ultimately to stay connected with them. And if they feel that it\u2019s better for them to use telemedicine, better to go the urgent care, it\u2019s better to go to their primary care physician. Obviously, we\u2019re fine with that. That\u2019s a great answer for them. It\u2019s a great answer for the payer. And then, ultimately, they stay inside the HCA system. So, we see this, net-net, is still being a positive scenario for us and one that we can manage around.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you. Julianne, we\u2019ve got time for two more questions, and we\u2019re going to call it.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Just interested in as you think about the mix of patients for next year and some of the assumptions that you have around COVID, just how you\u2019re thinking about the timing and efficacy of the vaccines going into the market and how that influences your thoughts on some of this initial planning that you\u2019re doing for 2021.\nSam Hazen: Okay. I\u2019m going to ask Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Officer, to answer that question. Thank you.\nJon Perlin: Thanks, Sam. I think, it\u2019s really anyone\u2019s guess as to when the vaccines are probably available. Certainly, they\u2019re promising, but to get them broadly distributed requires a great deal of logistics. There is also broad skepticism. So, I think we have to think about next year COVID as sort of continuation of what we see now. Clearly, diseases that are spread by respiratory transmission increase in the winter. And I think, we\u2019ll anticipate some increase and drop after that. There are a number of vaccines that follow the initial build. I think, there\u2019s some speculation, they may be even better. And so, I think next year is really the year where we\u2019ll see the introduction of vaccine, the larger scale uptick of vaccine and potentially greater effectiveness of the vaccines.\nOperator: Your last question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Ransom: Just to drill down into COVID a bit. If we look at the quarter, do you have a sense of kind of payer mix within COVID? And then, for your commercial COVID, are they mostly paid on a per VM basis, or is this set up like the DRG with the 20% add-on and maybe a little extra for the commercial upgrade?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. John, this is Bill. Our COVID mix is probably 50% running Medicare, 10% to 11% on Medicaid, and probably close to 20% on just procure manage, and then we have a few other categories that\u2019s impacting that. So, it\u2019s fairly comparable to our overall with some changes that fluctuate from market by market. So, that\u2019s the mix.\nJohn Ransom: So, on your commercial, how do you take per day\u2026\nBill Rutherford: It follows the contractual terms. So, whatever the contractual terms with that payer would be is what it would follow. So, it\u2019s a mix of payment methodologies.\nMark Kimbrough: John, thank you so much.\nSam Hazen: There\u2019s no commercial add-on per say, like the Medicare program. If that was his final...\nBill Rutherford: Yes, I think that was.\nSam Hazen: So, there is no -- it just follows the term as Bill indicated. \nMark Kimbrough: All right, Julianne. I think, we can wrap it up.\nOperator: All right. So, if you don\u2019t have any closing remarks, this will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for everyone\u2019s participation. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional information on the quarter. You will note in our earnings release this morning, our reported adjusted EBITDA was slightly better than our preview. So, let me highlight some volume indicators and trends. Our same facility admissions declined 3.8% in the quarter. Within this, our Medicare admissions declined 7.6% from the prior year period, and our managed care admissions declined 0.7% from the prior year period. Our same facility admissions declined 3.7% in July, 5.2% in August, and 2.6% in September. Thus far in October, we've seen continued improvement in our admission trend. The COVID increases we saw in the quarter began in July and stayed elevated for most of August. Due to this and as we have mentioned in previous settings, we voluntarily suspended elective procedures in over 100 of our hospitals for some period of time during the July and August surges. And this impacted, our surgical volume statistics. Same facility in-patient surgeries declined 6.8% in the quarter from the prior year period. They were down about 11% in July, down about 9% in August and were within 1% of prior year levels in September. Same facility hospital-based outpatient surgeries declined 7.5% in the quarter from the prior year period with about 12% decline in both, July and August, but September saw some growth over prior year. Our ambulatory surgery center volume had a similar result with a decline of 4.7% for the quarter occurred, which occurred primarily in July and August, while September's volume was about 1% over prior year. The surgical volume results were influenced by business of surgical days in any given month and September did have one more surgical day than the prior year. But, we wanted to share some of the results we saw throughout the quarter to highlight the impact of our voluntary suspension of the elective procedures. Emergency room visits trends were consistent throughout the quarter, which declined 20.3% from the prior year period. Our level 1 and 3 visits declined about 29% and our level 4 and 5 visits declined about 14%. Admissions to the emergency room were down about 2.5%. The higher acuity and revenue intensity results we saw in the quarter offset the impact of these volume declines. Our same facility net revenue per adjusted admission increased 14.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year period. There were three factors that contributed to this result. One is a level of COVID-19 patients we served in the quarter. As we previously mentioned, we served close to 40,000 inpatient COVID cases in the quarter or about 8% of our total admissions. These patients have a higher acuity than average and a longer length of stay, which resulted in a higher consumption of resources. Due to this, revenue per admission is a little bit higher than our average. Second, within our non-COVID patients, we saw a higher acuity patient as those patients presenting for service have been in higher acuity areas such as neurology, cardiology, and oncology and the lower acute services were slower to return. Our non-COVID case mix index increased approximately 5% over the prior year. Lastly, as we mentioned earlier, our maintenance care mix of inpatients as our Medicare volume was slightly slower to recover. Our teams continue to do an excellent job managing our cost structure during these pandemic cycles, which benefited our performance in the quarter, and our labor, supply and other operating costs as a percent of revenue, all showed improvement as compared to the prior year period. Before I conclude, let me speak briefly to some cash flow balance sheet and liquidity metrics. As we mentioned in our earlier calls, the Company took a number of measures early in this pandemic to enhance our operational and financial flexibility. Because of these actions and other factors, we were able to announce that we will return or repay early $6 billion of CARES Act funding, including $4.4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments, and $1.6 billion of provider relief funds we have received. We are working with various government agencies to execute these payments. We expect to fund the entire amount from available cash in future cash flow from operations. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had approximately $6.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet and $7.7 billion of capacity under our credit facilities. Our debt to EBITDA leverage was 2.67 times as of September 30, 2020, after netting out available cash. Cash flow from operations was $2.7 billion for the quarter, which includes the effect of approximately $300 million of stimulus payments that will be part of our repayment. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $12.8 billion, which includes approximately $6.1 billion of government stimulus funds. Also, as mentioned in last quarter's call, we have reduced the Company's planned capital expenditures and anticipate our full year 2020 capital spending to be about $3 billion. In short, we believe even after considering the plan returns $6 billion of CARES Act funding, the cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet position of the Company provides us the financial capability and flexibility to navigate these unprecedented times, and we will continue to look for opportunities to create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Sam. Yes. On capital, as you know, our fourth quarter typically runs a little bit higher. I don't necessarily think the fourth quarter alone is indicative of go-forward run rate. We're obviously in the \u201821 planning and we'll finalize our capital expectations. I think, it likely will land somewhere north of where we are in 2020 but less than what our original historical spend was for this year. So, we'll give you some detail as we get into next year. Yes. On the COVID, as you've identified, volume will fluctuate. It's hard to isolate that population by itself, if you will, because as we mentioned and intended to highlight in our trends, it also has an impact on some of them were elective as it fluctuates. But, we think we'll have a level of COVID patients that we're going to serve throughout 2021, as Sam mentioned in his comments. And I think we're prepared to manage through those fluctuations as they present. Yes. A.J., first, on your first one, yes, I'll confirm your numbers are correct from what our original 2020 guidance was. Yes. Ralph, on the first one, I think, the 2% to 3% is just broad guidelines that we wanted to provide you with that would include all of our patients, including the COVID within that. But, obviously, we're going to finalize our planning here and share with you more thoughts as we get into our year-end call. But, at 2% to 3% is our broad planning, including all patients. Yes. Justin, this is Bill. On the revenue side, it's a little early. We know the composition of the revenue is changing as we've seen over these past couple of quarters. So, I don't want to give parameters on the revenue yet till we complete our planning. On payer mix for the quarter, very quickly, our Medicare was roughly -- our inpatient payer mix was roughly 45%, our managed care, 24% and then self-pay was around 8% for the quarter. And then, what was the third one? Obviously, a sequential improvement in our admissions. As you saw, we finished the September at 2.6%. October is probably 1.5% down, a little better from where we ended September. But obviously, it's still early in the cycle. Yes. Josh, I think there's a couple of points. And there's obviously a lot of puts and takes, whether performances, our thinking into next year, and we haven't finalized it. One is, we know we do have some other government funding relative to COVID patients this year, whether it be the Medicare DRG add-on or the HRSA payments to recognize resources consumed by uninsured COVID. And I don't think we see those continuing too long into 2021. And again, I think, the purpose of our guidance was to give you our general thinking versus that we've gone through a lot of calcs on each one of those inputs. And so, as we complete that, we'll go forward and give you our input in that. I think, again, I'd reiterate, we're confident in the team's ability to hold many of our costs that we've seen. And as Sam mentioned in his comments, to the extent that we have any new costs that may enter the system, we've got resiliency plans that I think we can execute to help offset those. And I think, given the profile we're seeing, we feel generally reasonably comfortable with our current margin performance. Yes. Let me start with that. And so again, I think, as we mentioned in our comments, the balance sheet and our cash flow gives us a lot of flexibility and I think, capability of managing through different cycles. We've made -- haven't made any decisions on capital allocation at this point or resumption of the share repurchase or dividend. We will complete our planning in \u201821 and announce kind of what our plans are. As we've said before, I think we have a pretty long history of having a balanced and disciplined approach to deploying our capital. And as we get some understanding of the market environment, we're looking for when is the right time to resume some of that but we haven't made any decisions at this point. About the economy? And Kevin, this is Bill on the capital. I don't think there's any one unique trigger that we're looking for. I mean, we're obviously still going through these cycles. We want a couple more stable months to kind of firm up our assessments that we've talked about. And part of our normal routine as we go through any year is to make those assessments, judge the environment we're in and make the right capital decisions. That's what we're going to plan to do and we'll share with you our final thinking in our year-end call. Yes. It was on the net effect of the COVID and the loss of those businesses. I'd just say it's hard to really quantify and that's why we -- I tried to give you some of the trends we saw in the surgical volume. We do know and as we've talked about before, we recaptured some of that, but we don't think we recaptured all of that. And so, the net effect is really hard to quantify. But, we'll continue to monitor our volume trends as they progress through the balance of the year. Yes. John, this is Bill. Our COVID mix is probably 50% running Medicare, 10% to 11% on Medicaid, and probably close to 20% on just procure manage, and then we have a few other categories that's impacting that. So, it's fairly comparable to our overall with some changes that fluctuate from market by market. So, that's the mix. It follows the contractual terms. So, whatever the contractual terms with that payer would be is what it would follow. So, it's a mix of payment methodologies. Yes, I think that was."

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "Good morning. The disciplined operating culture of HCA Healthcare, and the ability to take full advantage of what our size and enterprise capabilities have to offer have produced remarkable performance for the Company this year. These attributes, along with the great people we have in our organization, and the steadfast commitment we have to our mission have allowed us to deliver value consistently and at high levels for all of our stakeholders. As demonstrated again in this quarter's results, we continue to show resiliency, both operationally and financially, while also enhancing our overall position across the communities we serve. For the past couple of years, we've used the third quarter's earnings call to provide some early thoughts about the upcoming year. In those years, we obviously had a more stable environment, economically, politically and operationally. While always difficult to predict our business with precision, today's environment with all of its uncertainty makes it particularly challenging. We plan to provide you with more details in January, when we complete our planning process for 2021. By that time, we will have a few more months of experience that we can hopefully use to give a better indication of our thoughts regarding certain components of our business. With that being said, we're beginning to formulate some preliminary perspectives around a few aspects of our business. And I want to share those with you this morning. With respect to volume, given the unusual volatility we've seen in 2020 with COVID-19 surges, mandatory and voluntary suspension of elected business and intermittent recovery periods, we currently plan to use 2019 volumes as a starting reference point for early 2021 planning purposes. Since the pandemic began, we have had very few months, mainly September and October that we believe are indicative of somewhat stable activity. Notwithstanding, we have some observations from these two months, and we are using them to inform our current thinking. First, we believe, we will continue to treat COVID-19 patients throughout 2021. Over the last two quarters, COVID-19 patients have represented approximately 6% of our admissions. Recognizing that there are many variables that could affect next year, at this point, we believe it is reasonable to estimate around 4% to 5% of our 2021 admissions could be related to the virus. This factor suggests continued high levels of acuity in our overall mix of inpatient business, which should provide some support for current inpatient revenue trends. It is difficult however to know if the various governmental reimbursement programs for providing care to COVID-19 patients will continue through 2021. Overall, we believe demand for inpatient admissions next year will be down from 2019, approximately 2% to 3%, but again, with the mix being more acute. On the outpatient side, as compared to 2019, we anticipate emergency room visits will be down in 2021, similar to this year. But like our inpatient business, we expect it to be more acute, which should drive higher revenue per visit, offsetting some of the volume decline. For outpatient surgeries, we are expecting some recovery over current levels, but we expect volumes to be down slightly. With respect to managing operating costs, which has been a key part of our solid results this year, we have continued confidence in our team's ability to hold many of the gains they have made across the different expense categories. In those areas where we anticipate some pressure, we believe we have future resiliency actions that can help offset some of these challenges. Collectively, these factors lead us to think that our preliminary expectations for adjusted EBITDA for 2021 could look similar to the Company's original 2020 guidance, but likely with a slightly wider range of results. Clearly, there are additional factors that could influence these perspectives and expectations, including but not limited to, the economy could worsen and impact payer mix, the election result to bring adverse changes to healthcare policies, and the pandemic could fluctuate or affect our results in ways that we cannot anticipate. We will evolve our thinking accordingly as we gain a better understanding of these factors. We believe as I stated in my comments a few weeks ago that we have proven we can meet the challenge of this pandemic. We also believe the Company will be able to navigate successfully through future challenges as well. Since the onset of this historic event, we have improved many clinical, operational, technology and organizational capabilities. We believe these improvements coupled with the financial flexibility we possess, should provide us with a platform to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. Once again, I want to thank our colleagues and our physicians for their incredible work during this year. We are fortunate to have such capable people in our organization. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for questions. Thank you. So, on the admission estimation, that's our best thinking at this particular point in time with, we are believing based upon September and October and maybe even June, to some degree that we will not see some of the lesser acute inpatient admissions that we had seen in previous years, but we will continue to see acute -- more acute type patients who need significant care throughout 2021, just as we've seen in many months this year as we've gone through this COVID period. So, that's our thinking. Obviously, as we get deeper into the fourth quarter, we're hopeful that we'll have months that are reflective enough of what we'll call stable activity that will allow us to inform that thinking even further. And if we have adjustments to that thinking, we will clearly update you in our fourth quarter call in January. We don't have those details at this particular point in time to share, Pito. We need to finish our planning process as we typically do in the fourth quarter. We're trying to give you some general sense of where we see things. There's obviously puts and takes on every line item on our income statement as always. And as we get further into the fourth quarter and refine our thinking on each of those categories, we'll give you some range of expectations around those metrics in our planning process in our fourth quarter earnings release. Let me answer a couple of questions here, Gary, and then I'll hand it over to Bill. I think, it's important to understand that two-thirds, two-thirds of our ER visit decline in the third quarter was either uninsured patients or Medicaid. And the balance of our visits were patients who were more acute, as one would expect, and that they delayed possibly or deferred care and were more sick when they came to the emergency room. So, I think it's a very important element of our ER business. We don't know exactly how that's going to play out, but that has been the pattern throughout most of the pandemic. So, Bill, do you want to answer the other question? And then, A.J., on the question around future resiliency, Bill is leading this effort, but I want to give you some strategic approach that we're taking because we believe that there are significant opportunities inside of the approach, and we are executing on some of those as we speak. And we still have capacity in these initiatives as we push forward. But, we have grown the organization over the last decade, I'll call it, organically. And through that organic growth, it has yielded results that we think are very powerful for the Company over the past decade and have positioned the Company very well. As a matter of fact, our market share at the end of the first quarter right before COVID hit or even at the end of March period is at an all-time high. We think our overall positioning in the marketplace has improved over these seven months in many circumstances. And if we move forward, we should be in an even better position. But with respect to our financial resiliency program, we have looked and challenged ourselves at a number of areas where we have redundancies and/or duplications in our operations. Today, for example, we have multiple call centers. We think we have opportunity to create consolidation in those areas and create efficiencies, better outcomes for our patient and ultimately a better use of overall Company resources. We have similar opportunities in our lab services. Throughout the pandemic, we've enhanced our lab capabilities, and it's enlightened us on opportunities to advance our lab services in a way that we think can yield efficiencies and better access to lab services and so forth, doing it more efficiently. And so, we have those type of examples. We're challenging how we're structured to see again if we have redundancies in our structure and whether or not there are better ways to service the field and produce outcomes on that front. And then, what I'm most excited about is our technology initiative where we have opportunities to advance technology even further in the Company and ultimately deliver a better patient outcome, but at the same time, support our physicians, support our management and deliver our services more efficiently. So, we think these work streams to have opportunities for the Company that we can use to offset any pressures that might serve us in 2021 and on into 2022. This is Sam. As it relates to the competitive positioning, we don't have any data on the second and third quarter yet that would give us market share information and provide insights into whether we had more patients in our hospitals than our competitors. Intuitively, I don't think that was the case because all the systems in these markets were under community pressure to respond to COVID. What I'm reacting to is certain outpatient opportunities, certain physician opportunities, certain program development opportunities that we think have evolved that positions our organization, we believe, better than what it was at the beginning of this year. And we will continue to, as I mentioned on the preview call, continue to move forward on those components of our development in order to enhance our overall position. I don't have it for the market share, Frank, for the second and third first quarter. We're obviously just processing the first quarter. I think, we had one of the strongest portfolio performance in years across HCA's 185 hospitals. 76% of our facilities had year-over-year EBITDA growth. So, we had very consistent performance across all of our divisions. To say one, we had a little bit of a challenge in the far west division, primarily because of our California hospitals and just the slow uptake in the activity in those communities. But our strength across the portfolio, it's very good, consistent. And I think it again reflects the power of our portfolio, the diversification of our portfolio, including even the service mix that we have inside of it. So, very strong portfolio performance for the Company. I'll take that. This is Sam. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we're making these judgments off of our current read of economy, and we're not factoring in any kind of significant worsening of the economy. So, obviously, if the economy were to worsen, it could have an impact on our expected results as we've indicated here. This is Sam. I'll let Bill take the second question. With respect to the COVID assumption, our experience with COVID throughout the pandemic has been that it's choppy. There are going to be situations where COVID is up; there's going to be situations where COVID is down. We're trying to give you some estimation of the average that we're expecting. We are, at this particular point in time, balancing off what I call the floor. And we are not nearly as intense with the volume of patients today as we did in late July and early August. But, we are seeing a little bit of a rise, primarily in one market, and that's El Paso. And that's created a significant challenge in that community, but we only have two hospitals there. And at this particular point in time, we're able to support them appropriately. And with the actions that the community has just recently taken as well as what the governor has done to support that community, we believe that we should be in a reasonable situation there. So, we're not anticipating month-by-month estimations around COVID. We're just going to respond to it with the capabilities we've developed. And we're estimating what we believe to be an overall metric that is likely to occur in 2021. Well, I'll give you a very specific example that we've been able to use on two fronts this year. We have a system called NATE. NATE is a technology solution that gives us individual insight into every patient in our hospital right now. And that insight provides clinical metrics, it provides bed location, it provides certain metrics around what requirements the patient has with respect to, let's just say, ventilator management. And we've been able to use those insights from this particular system to improve our ventilation management of COVID patients in a way that has reduced their length of stay on it and provided a much more efficacious outcome. So, that's just one example that reduces ICU days. It creates a lower length of stay for the patient and ultimately, a much better outcome. So, we see opportunities to advance this system. The second aspect of NATE that's proved to be very productive for us is capacity management, allowing us to position patients most efficiently within the facilities or even across our networks at time. So, this insight into our capacity management has allowed us to be, I think, more efficient at managing our beds and the turnovers, if you will, around those beds, providing better discharge planning and timing and then better utilization of existing assets. So, those are just two examples. We see opportunities beyond that as we've had experiences with clinical initiatives, like our sepsis initiative in the past. But going forward, we see more on that particular platform. On capacity, I mean, we have multiple capacity metrics that we use to determine needs for capital. We have triggers around how many ER visits per bed, how many surgeries per surgical suite, what's the occupancy in our ICUs, what's the occupancy triggers inside of our med/surg bed in order to determine capital needs. Currently, the Company is running about 70% utilization of its inpatient beds. Where we have capacity today, which won't require the same level of capital, at least in the intermediate run is in the emergency room. With emergency room volumes being down some, we find ourselves in a situation where at a company level from one facility to the other, we may have issues. But at a Company level, we're running about 60% to 65% utilization of our ER beds currently. That's down from about 85% in 2019. So, we have the situation where our ER beds are flexible now, allowing us to accommodate more volume, if in fact, it presents itself. So, I don't see capacity as being a barrier to growth for us. We do have capital still in the pipeline that will ultimately add capacity to institutions that we believe needed. And those will be playing out over the rest of this year and on into 2021. And I think, the Company is in a solid capacity position today, generally speaking, maybe in the best capacity position we've been in a number of years, given the circumstances. And so, from that standpoint, there's not any significant pressures. I don't remember what the last question was. Bill, do you... This is Sam again. We don't know, to be honest with you. We're not anticipating a further decline in 2021. We're anticipating that the \u201820 decline as compared to \u201819 volume, that's the metric that we're reflecting here. As I just mentioned, we're running about 65% utilization of our emergency room beds across the Company, which gives us ample capacity to absorb growth, if growth resurfaces in this particular category of our business. If it doesn't, as I mentioned, we're anticipating that the ER patient that we do see is one that is in fact more acute. And so, the revenue per visit will actually be supported by the acuity of those patients. Whether or not they've been lost forever? I don't know. Our business model is to have capabilities outside of the ER as we've been investing in both, urgent care platforms over the years, telemedicine platform significantly during COVID and then our primary care platform as well. So, we have multiple platforms to stay connected to the patient. That's the important objective for us is ultimately to stay connected with them. And if they feel that it's better for them to use telemedicine, better to go the urgent care, it's better to go to their primary care physician. Obviously, we're fine with that. That's a great answer for them. It's a great answer for the payer. And then, ultimately, they stay inside the HCA system. So, we see this, net-net, is still being a positive scenario for us and one that we can manage around. Okay. I'm going to ask Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Officer, to answer that question. Thank you. There's no commercial add-on per say, like the Medicare program. If that was his final... So, there is no -- it just follows the term as Bill indicated."

Certainly, they're promising, but to get them broadly distributed requires a great deal of logistics. There is also broad skepticism. So, I think we have to think about next year COVID as sort of continuation of what we see now. Clearly, diseases that are spread by respiratory transmission increase in the winter. And I think, we'll anticipate some increase and drop after that. There are a number of vaccines that follow the initial build. I think, there's some speculation, they may be even better. And so, I think next year is really the year where we'll see the introduction of vaccine, the larger scale uptick of vaccine and potentially greater effectiveness of the vaccines."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and instructions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Kimbrough: Thank you, Ian. And good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call and our webcast. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and CFO, Bill Rutherford, as well Dr. Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Officer. Sam and Bill will provide comments on the company's second quarter results and then we'll open up for questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in today's second quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. I will now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Good morning. And thank you for joining today\u2019s call. The second quarter was a remarkable 91 days for the company, possibly the most remarkable I've experienced in my 37 years with the organization. It started with a level of uncertainty and uneasiness that was very high as the pandemic began, the middle part was filled with example, after example of people inside our company, stepping up and delivering for each other and delivering for our patients. All the while strengthening our culture of taking care of others in the right way, whenever we are needed. And finally, it ended with the prowess of our teams on display, showing their abilities to manage relationships with their employees, respond to the needs of their physicians, deliver on operational adjustments that were necessary, given the circumstances and build clinical capabilities that not only give us more confidence in responding effectively to the ongoing challenges and resurgence of this pandemic, but provide us capabilities to improve our services and create even more value in the future. I've never been more proud to work with this company that I am now. As a shareholder, I hope you are equally as proud to be associated with HCA Healthcare. From day one, we addressed the pandemic with two clear objectives. The first was to protect our people that is keep them safe and keep them employed, giving them the assurances they needed both at work and at home. The second was to protect the company and that is protecting its financial positions, so we can continue to serve our communities for years to come. Both of these objectives endure today and directed by the guiding principles we laid out at the beginning of the pandemic, they allow us to provide the care patients deserve. Thus far, we have been able to achieve these foundational objectives because of the partnership and hard work of our 280,000 colleagues and 45,000 physicians. I want to thank them for their unwavering commitment and tremendous sacrifices in the midst of this global health crisis. In addition, thorough planning, solid execution, appropriate resource allocation and focus leadership all contributed to numerous positive outcomes. We also had strong collaboration with our partners, health plans, lab companies, suppliers, post-acute providers and others who I also want to thank. Every corner of this organization has come together to do what's right. In times of great uncertainty, our people continue to show up and pursue the path forward. We press on in that journey now. In pursue of the first objective, we implemented a number of pandemic pay programs to support our colleagues, including a program that continued income for them that otherwise would have ceased due to stay at home orders and reduce patient volumes. 145,000 colleagues benefited from these programs at a cost to the company of approximately $110 million. As a result, and I'm proud of this fact, not one employee in HCA Healthcare has been laid off or furloughed due to the pandemic. The HCA Hope Fund raised $4.5 million during the quarter and unprecedented level of contributions from employees, our board and the First Foundation. This year the fund has provided almost $2 million in grants to employees who needed emergency support. Our mission is to care for and improve human life, which primarily revolves around our patients, but it also, revolves around our employees. Truly, we care like family. Today, HCA Healthcare is taking care of more than 33,000 COVID-19 inpatients including over 5,000 patients who are currently in-house. Throughout this pandemic, we have developed more enterprise capabilities to respond to this crisis giving us greater confidence as we address the resurgence and the many challenges that exist in the communities that we serve. Examples of these capabilities include; enhanced clinical management protocols for patients on ventilators, increased lab testing capacity and improved turnaround times for results, currently 90% of COVID-19 lab results are produced in less than 48 hours, more sophisticated supply chain systems and logistics management, we have distributed over 20 million pieces of personal protective equipment to care givers. Additionally, we rapidly developed and deployed applications that manage capacity in case management requirements, increase telemedicine product offerings in capacity, we performed over 500,000 telemedicine visits in the quarter which was well above prior levels. And finally, we initiated various clinical research projects that should improve patient care in the future. Now let me transition to the earnings report. Like the first quarter, our business was significantly limited by governmental policies that restricted elective procedures and required communities to shelter at home. As many of our markets begin to reopen in May, patient volumes improved as our teams executed their reboot plans. Over the course of successive two-week period, we saw sequential improvements in most categories, ending the quarter with modest growth in admissions. For the quarter, admissions were down almost 13%. April was down 27%, May was down 12% and June was up 1%. Outpatient volumes across most categories also improved sequentially during the quarter, but we did not reach last year's level for any service. Emergency room visits and outpatient surgeries were each down 33% in the quarter. On the revenue side, the qualitative aspects of our inpatient -- specifically the following two factors drove a 10% increase year-over-year in inpatient revenue per admission. First, the overall acuity was higher with case mix index growing 3% and second, payer mix was better with commercial business representing 28% of admissions as compared to 26% last year. As a result, inpatient revenue was only down around 4%. Outpatient revenue declined 30% and in total, revenue decreased 12% as compared to the second quarter last year. The improvement in our financial results was generally better and broader than we expected but we believe it is too early for us to make any conclusive statements about the future or provide any guidance for the rest of the year. As we manage the company through these remarkable times, we are mindful of our mission as well as the many uncertainties that remain with respect to the broader recovery of the economy, uninsured levels, government regulations, state budgets and the resurgence and duration of COVID-19. In my comments last quarter, I spoke about the three-stage cost reduction plan we developed to respond to the different scenarios we had modeled. During the second quarter, we implemented first stage items and also many second stage items. Our teams did a masterful job in executing these plans. In the quarter, salaries and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses collectively declined approximately 11% as compared to the prior year. For the quarter, we reported pretax government stimulus income from the CARES Act of $822 million, which reduced expenses further and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.73. In sum, our overall performance was better than we expected, with diluted earnings per share of $3.16, an increase of 46% as compared to the second quarter last year. We continue to maintain a close watch on the macroeconomic factors that influence our business. Again, as we get further into the year, and gain a greater visibility into these factors and the performance of the company. We hope to be in a better position to evaluate the capital and operational decisions that we made earlier in the pandemic. Currently, we are dealing with resurgence of COVID-19 and many of our communities in particular Texas and Florida. We made the decision across both states to restrict elective procedures where appropriate, freeing up capacity and staffing while preserving PPE. We continue to work with state and local governments to coordinate community wide efforts. Thus far, we have been able to manage the situation and also provide non-elective care to non-COVID patients who need it. I mentioned in my comments last quarter that I had faith in our team's abilities to adjust their operations. And I believe they would once again respond to this challenge and deliver results. As you can see, they did it again. We are fortunate to have can do teams. I'm confident they will continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. Even though the second quarter felt a lot longer to me the 91 days. I'm reminded once again, what an incredible and resilient organization we have. One that is driven by common purpose to do the right thing for others. As I've highlighted today, we accomplished a lot during this time across multiple dimensions of our business. These accomplishments, I believe, will position us well for long-term success and continue to the great legacy that is HCA Healthcare. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill Rutherford for more details on our financial results.\nBill Rutherford: Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional information on the quarter. As we expected, the second quarter saw progressive improvement each month of the quarter as we evolved from the initial response phase early in the quarter, and then enter the reboot phase during the second half of the quarter. We saw an improvement from the middle of April, which was our low volume point throughout the quarter in most every volume statistic. Our same facility admissions declined 12.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year period, and the monthly progression as Sam mentioned in his comments on admissions occurred with most of our key volume indicators. Same facility inpatient surgeries declined 15.7% in the quarter, with April declining about 38%, May was down 12% and June was up 3% over the prior year. Same facility hospital-based outpatient surgeries were down about 27% in the quarter, with April down about 65%, May down about 19% in June was up 4% from the prior year. Our outpatient surgeries in our ambulatory surgery centers were down about 40% in the quarter with April down 85% May down 32% and June was up 1% over the prior year. Our teams did an incredible job of managing our cost structure during this period of significant volume and revenue fluctuation during the quarter. We began adjusting most of our discretionary and variable expenses in late March and April, when the volume declines were most pronounced. We were able to sustain many of the expense improvements throughout the quarter as the volumes began to improve in May and June. As reflected in our financial statements, our reported revenues declined about $1.5 billion, or 12.2% in the quarter from the prior year period. Our salaries and benefits supplies and other operating expenses collectively declined approximately $1.1 billion or 10.5% during the quarter compared to the prior year. This is a testament to our management teams across the company, and highlights our ability to adequately adjust to the sudden volume declines as well as efficiently serve the increased volumes we saw during the reboot phase. Let me highlight a couple of other important items in the quarter starting with the CARES Act. As we discussed last quarter, the company is very appreciative of the government's recognition of the significant impact this pandemic has had on healthcare providers across the country. As I alluded to previously, our revenue was significantly impacted during the quarter due to this pandemic and the subsequent stopping of most elective procedures. In addition, we experienced significant costs in the preparation and response phase, including our pandemic pay program, other employee assistance efforts, as well as securing adequate supply chain items. We believe the CARES Act funding was developed to account for this volume disruption and to offset some of these costs, both of which began impacting us in the first quarter and to ensure healthcare providers across the country could continue to offer critical services to the communities they serve. As noted in our release and financial statements, we recognized $822 million of government stimulus income from the CARES Act during the quarter. This equates to about $590 million on an after-tax basis. As of June 30th, we had received approximately $1.4 billion of CARES Act stimulus funding. This included about $920 million from the general distribution and about $450 million from certain targeted distributions for rural and safety net hospitals, as well as hotspot funding. We have not recognized any of the targeted distributions in our P&L as of June 30th, as we are still performing the required analysis and attestation process. The evaluation period and guidance related to the relief fund continue to evolve and as a result, we\u2019ve recognized $822 million of the $920 million in general distribution funds received in the quarter. Subsequent to June 30th, we\u2019ve received approximately $300 million in additional targeted distribution funds. Before I conclude, let me speak briefly to some cash flow balance sheet and liquidity metrics. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, the company took a number of measures early in this pandemic cycle, including entering into a $2 billion short term credit facility, suspending our share repurchase program and quarterly dividend, as well as reducing planned capital expenditures. These were in addition to a number of operational adjustments, we mentioned earlier. All of these efforts have enhanced the company's liquidity and capability to manage through these uncertain times. As of June 30th, 2020, the company had $7.7 billion of capacity under our credit facilities and $4.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Our debt to EBITDA leverage was 2.7x as of June 30th, 2020, after netting out our cash on the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $8.72 billion for the quarter, which includes the following components. We received approximately $4.4 billion in advanced Medicare payments during the quarter. These amounts are scheduled to be repaid over an eight-month period, beginning in August of 2020. Cash flow from operations was also fairly impacted by the approximate $1.4 billion of CARES Act funding received during the quarter, I mentioned earlier, as well as the deferral of estimated income tax payments to the third quarter of approximately $200 million and payroll tax deferrals, that will be paid in late 2021 and 2022 of approximately $200 million. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, we\u2019ve reduced the company's plan capital expenditures. At this point, we anticipate reducing our capital spending to approximately $2.8 billion to $3 billion for 2020, as compared to our original plan of approximately $4.2 billion for the year. This remains subject to further evaluation of operating trends and opportunities. In short, we believe the steps that we implemented have enhanced the company's financial flexibility as we navigate these unprecedented times. We continue to believe the strength, scale and resiliency of HCA are longstanding and critical attributes that served us well, not only during this past quarter, but we'll continue to service as we can go through the future cycles of this pandemic. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mark and we'll open it up for Q&A.\nMark Kimbrough: Okay, well thank you, Bill. We will now start the question and answer session. Ian, would you please give instructions to those who would like to get into the queue.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about decremental margins and what you're seeing in COVID effective phase to go into late-June and into July. So, appreciate all the color. The decremental margins were incredibly strong this quarter. I think they're only down about 30% -- near about 30%. Just curious if that's something that you think is sustainable going forward. And then can you give us some color on what's happening in Florida and Texas in late June into July as in terms of volumes and payer mix? We've seen significant pick up in the COVID cases there. Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Hey, good morning, Justin. So, let me start with that and I'll pass Sam to add in. So, as we mentioned, I think the acuity of the patients that returned were a higher than they were pre-pandemic. As we saw some of our higher acuity patients in cardiology, neurosciences and orthopedics returned. And the lower acuity patients were maybe the ones that will take a little bit longer to return. In addition, we had favorable kind of ICU and NICU days. There was a high that contributed to the acuity. And so, I do think that the margin generations of those higher acuity patients as they return were higher than normal and what they were pre-pandemic. As we mentioned throughout our prepared remarks, we're very pleased with the response of our operating teams and the efforts we are able to make around discretionary costs and managing the variable cost. And we're very pleased with how we finished the quarter on that. Sam, do you want to give any comments on going forward?\nSam Hazen: Well, let me speak to Texas and Florida. Those are the two states where we have seen COVID-19 resurgence at its greatest level. We have other components of our company where we are seeing COVID volumes, but they're not to the level that we had seen in Texas and are seeing in Florida. In Texas which was a little bit ahead of Florida, if you will, with respect to the resurgence. I think the company has done an incredible job at responding to the needs of our communities, as have our competitors. And I think it's a testament to the healthcare system in the country, and its ability to respond to these challenges from one place to the other. What we've seen in Texas is that our volume for COVID patients have peaked and actually started to decline. Whereas in Florida, we've seen a flattening out in a very modest growth rate over the last week. And we hope Florida is maybe a week behind what's going on inside of Texas. In total, our activity levels are up slightly in July as compared to June with respect to overall in patient census. Clearly with our decision to restrict elective care to manage our response to the community, we have seen a slowdown in surgical activities. But we anticipate recovering that at some point in the future as we get better visibility into the COVID cases in the different communities. Our teams have done an incredible job as I mentioned in my comments. Our physicians have supported our teams incredibly well. And then our corporate and other teams have made capabilities available to our institutions, allowing us to respond very appropriately. So, I'm really pleased with our outcomes. And we do believe that we're going to have to manage through COVID again. It's not something that's going to go away necessarily. But our ability to scale up, scale down, scale up, I think is now been proven. We've gained greater confidence in our ability to run our business, and at the same time respond to surges. And so, the execution and the agility that our facilities and our teams have showed over this period of time helps us in developing learnings that we will be able to advance as we go forward on into this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Hi, thank you. Really impressive expense management in the quarter. It's really commendable. I guess I just want to follow up a little bit and understand what you're saying. I think I understand that too. So, if we look at this improving trajectory of revenue and volume through the quarter. And we get to July, you're saying inpatient census is up but I guess COVID is fueling some of that. And surgical volume is down. Is that really, I mean, just really happening sort of in Texas and Florida and not in the hotspots? Is there diversity of that experience even in those states? And then when we look at the rest of the portfolio that perhaps isn't being as hit by the resurgence as much. Are you still generally seeing an improving trajectory out of June into July? So, I guess we're trying to get at is there any sort of pent-up demand that's now diminishing or is it really just the virus that's causing some of the surgical activity to slowdown in some of those hotspots?\nSam Hazen: All right, thanks, Gary. Well, we have not restricted elective procedures or surgeries in markets where we don't have a need to respond to COVID. So obviously, in Texas it started out, in Houston in the Valley and those were the first markets where we implemented our elective procedure decisions. Then as it expanded to San Antonio, we replicated that in that market so it\u2019s sequenced based upon the circumstances and it will unsequence if you will, based upon the circumstances. So, in Dallas, for example which is not as significantly impacted by COVID, we've started to relax some of our procedure, requirements and restrictions in order to deal with the circumstances in those communities. So, we're going to see some natural ebb and flow in Florida similarly and then if we were to see it somewhere else, we would use those experiences that we learned in Texas, in Miami as an example to manage the situation. And this is what we're required to do with respect to our responsibilities as community infrastructure. We take it seriously and we think we've been able to prove to ourselves and prove to the community that we can respond effectively to the needs of our patients whatever COVID does surface at a level that\u2019s much greater than what we were seeing in April and May. And we had some of this activity in June in some markets where we had COVID surge going on. It wasn\u2019t as hot profile as what it was in Texas and Florida. Again, we were managing through that within our portfolio similarly in learning from that Gary and putting those learnings into our experiences now. And I'm confident that we will continue to learn and gain greater capabilities in managing the volume requirements in the ups and downs of this particular pandemic.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Yes, great job on the crazy quarter. Maybe just ask about the backlog or the pent-up demand, I don't know whether there\u2019s any way that you're able to assess maybe through your doctor practices what that looks like, is that something that's going to go through the rest of the year? Could that spill over into next year? And there's been discussion about rebuilding a new pipeline not just working through the backlog; can you talk about your sense of people doing the primary care and to build the case backlog for surgeries in orthopedics and all that stuff? And then if I could just slip one other in, Bill mentioned the CapEx decline, can you comment on what, where you're pulling back on CapEx and should we assume that you\u2019ll have to do more next year as a result of pulling back this year or these things that will permanently go away? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Okay, A.J. it\u2019s Sam. Thank you for the question. What I'll give you some observations. It's really difficult for us to pinpoint precisely what's going on in these circumstances. But we believe that approximately 40% to 50% of the deferred cases during the six to seven week period where most of our company was restricted on what we can do have been recaptured. And by recaptured, I mean either done or scheduled. So, the other 40% to 50% that hasn't been recaptured, we don't have visibility into the timing of that yet. Our positions continue to build back their practices just as we're building back our business in a way that should hopefully recapture some of that gap that I just mentioned, but we don't have great visibility into that as of yet. What I will tell you also is that, our ambulatory surgery centers were slower in their ramp up because they were at a complete stop versus our hospitals, which were continuing to run during the pandemic period. And so, they have ramped a little bit slower as Bill alluded to in his comment. What we saw within our surgery was procedures, orthopedic, spine, general surgery recovered quicker and stronger. We also saw a slower recovery in our GI procedures and certain diagnostic categories, which started to ramp significantly at the end of June, which gives us a belief that downstream those diagnostic patients and encounters will ultimately require some level of therapy, whether it's surgery or something else. So, we have some insights into it. We believe we'll need through the third quarter, probably through the fourth quarter to have a better sense of what the full recapture was of the cases that were in fact deferred. In cardiology, components of our cardiology business recovered really well, mainly electrophysiology and the procedures in that particular category. So, we had a mixed bag of events in the second quarter. And there are some indications of decent recovery in certain service lines, still more to come in others, and we will continue to monitor and try to gain insights from within our physician practices, whether they're affiliated or employed and within the different markets that we think are more advanced in their recovery period than others. And let that inform some of our observations further as we go into this next quarter.\nBill Rutherford: Yes, AJ, this is Bill. We think it was prudent at the time to reduce our capital spending, as we talked about last quarter and updated on this quarter, most of those projects were either deferral or slowing down some activity that was in the pipeline, as well as some deferral of our IT capital. We don't believe any of those decisions have compromised the strategic or growth initiative for us at this point, actually during the quarter, we turned on a couple of projects that we felt there was compelling opportunities out there. As far as next year, we'll have to see what the marketplace and the environment is. I don't think just because we deferred these, that we'll have to substantially increase over what we ordinarily would have planned, but we'll continue to evaluate that as we go through these different cycles.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Pito Chickering of Deutsche bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and excellent job in a very challenging environment to the whole team over at HCA. So, the question here is actually on the cost control side. You walked us through the revenue ramp throughout the quarter, but can you walk us through these sustainability, the cost control leverage that you put into place in April and March, and if the June positive revenues continue into July and the third quarter. How should we think about the cost controls you put in place?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Pito, this is Bill. Let me give a start to that. I think generally speaking, we can hold much of the cost controls that we put in place, as we said, most of those were around adjusting some of our discretionary spending, as well as some of the variable cost, like as Sam mentioned in his comments. We do know this recent COVID surge, we have to make sure we have the appropriate labor to serve that surge that may result in some increase use of either contract or premium labor. But I think as a whole, our teams have done a nice job. We continue to have opportunities to continue to look at other discretionary spending that we have. So, I think we've got a little bit of a track record of being able to manage to the environment, managed to the revenue that we have. We're very pleased with the results and we'll just going to have to see how the volume returns. And what are the variable costs that we're going to need to support that. But we feel for the most part, we can hold much of the expense adjustments that we made during the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor of Baird. Your line is open.\nMatthew Gillmor: Hey, thanks for the question. I was hoping I could get an update on the competitive landscape and maybe the potential for some M&A in the future. I know the industry is obviously working very collaboratively right now. But are you seeing any health systems that will be attractive partners for HCA struggling at all? And do you think you'll have more shots on goal from an M&A standpoint as you look out over the next one or two years?\nSam Hazen: Thank you, Matt. This is Sam, Matt. I don't know that we have any insights yet -- market insights into competitor issues or opportunities that might exist. I think everybody is scrambling in many markets to deal with COVID-19 and discharge their responsibilities appropriately. And the likelihood of any strategic decisions being made during this particular period in time I think is probably not that high. We will continue to explore. We have a very robust pipeline for outpatient facility development and/ or acquisitions that we're very excited about. And they're complementing of our existing networks. And we'll continue to look for adjacency -- with adjacencies within that platform, as it relates to new market opportunities, and so forth, I would just have to be, I think aware and open to those but very conservative and appropriate and how we think about them. And capital allocation, as Bill just alluded to in our planning. I don't know though, at this point in time that we're going to see anything in the short run. I think it's going to take systems a while to get through this period and then start to determine what their appropriate steps are. But as we've done in the past, we have been opportunistic, with respect to certain acquisitions. And we will continue to maintain that philosophy and appropriately move forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Whit Mayo of UBS. Your line is open.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe it's too early to tell. But any color around payer mix, and then any help on any internally developed framework to think about what the impact could be on HCA going forward? I mean I know you've had a lot of time to address this. And just wanted to get an updated view because my sense is that you're probably not seeing any meaningful change. And, I guess call it your core payer mix now. And maybe just an update on your self-pay and balance after reserve. Just where those are?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, this is Bill. As we mentioned in the payer mix, we did see some favorable in the payer mix as our commercial declines were a little less than or Medicare declines which makes sense that that the Medicare population may take a little bit longer time to return to a healthcare facility. Our uninsured volumes remained consistent with our overall volumes that we haven't seen any material kind of differential with our self-pay volume. Going forward, that's obviously an area that we're paying attention to. We're doing a lot of study market by market to track various factors, whether that be unemployment or coverage. I think it is too early to be able to predict how that may unfold. But clearly some of those factors will contribute to some of the uncertainty as we face the future. And factor into some of our decision. But we haven't seen a play out right now. But as we go forward, it's an area that we continue to monitor. And we have some data that we're trying to track to give us some insight as we go into our 2021 planning cycle.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette: Great thanks. Good morning, everybody. So now generally speaking, I think most investors are have been thinking about 2Q,'20 likely being a trough for the hospital industry profitability, then sequential improvements and 3Q and 4Q. And I guess my question is if we just ignore the stimulus money and look at your strong $1.85 billion of operational EBITDA generated in 2Q just operationally. Should the investment community generally assume that operational EBITDA will continue to improve sequentially, at least in 3Q from the $1.85 billion base that we see things right now? And despite the fluid situations in Florida and Texas are the two or to make that call right now, just on the quarterly cadence?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Steven. This is Bill. Let me try. I think the reality is there are still many unknowns relative to the duration and impact this pandemic will have. One of the reasons we cannot update or guidance at this point. It's unclear the longer-term macroeconomic impact of how this might change the overall landscape including patient behavior, the economy, employment and coverage and alike. So, these are kind of somewhat unprecedented times for so it's really hard to really project on a quarter by quarter basis what we might see. What we do know is that we've demonstrated and I think as we demonstrated in this quarter, we have plans in place to respond I think to a range of scenarios that might unfold. And we have different stages of management actions based on how either volume returns or what that makes may be and alike. So, we'll continue to assess the market, let you know what we're seeing as we go through the year. But right now, we're just unable to convert that to any type of financial guidance going forward and we just have to wait to see how the market place unfolds.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKevin Fischbeck: Thanks. I guess just try to go back to the pace and timing of volumes and like you guys obviously operate in a lot different markets across the country. I don't know if you have any experience about markets that maybe got hit a little bit earlier from COVID and have since rebounded and whether the elective procedures coming back are coming back a lot quicker in those markets or if it's more balance? I guess in the past you've given some data about procedures by the different regions that you guys or divisions that you guys have maybe color there and maybe as far as June goes, how many of those 14 or kind of at or above where they were because it sounds like June rolls up but what percent those regions you're seeing about average volumes?\nSam Hazen: So, here's how we looked at the recovery, we base lined everything off of April and we looked at May and June and highlighted within our portfolio what the revenue growth was in each of those months\u2019 vis-a-vis April. And for the most part, we had remarkably consistent performance across the divisions with the exception of a couple of spots. Those two spots were out West in California primarily and then, in Miami secondarily. And that was because of releasing the restrictions a little bit slower in parts of California than Texas and Tennessee and places like that as an example and then Miami was dealing with COVID in a totally different scenario and their restrictions were released a little bit differently. But within those two brackets, most of our divisions ramped reasonably consistent as it relates to their revenue growth over April. And so that's how we judged it, again it's very difficult for us to get very specific observations from one category to the other within procedures and so forth but looking at the revenue recovery as the better metric, we were able to see remarkable consistency across the rest of the company with respect to gains over April.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning. It sounds like in your comments that you really are more prepared as an enterprise for ebbs and flows and COVID volumes. And I'm just curious do you think that plays out with doctors, with physicians as well as patients in that over time if we do have another flare up in the fall of that? I mean, basically we all become more desensitized as we figure out operate in the whipsaws that we see become less noticeable in the future. And I guess related to that you did talk about on this current surge an increase in things like premium labor, contracted labor and alike. Maybe just any color you can tell us about general profitability of these COVID patients. Are they; is it actually a profitable business when you bring it in? And then last just any DC perspective, Bill made some comments about the funding you receive and yet you've got lost revenue and higher costs. Any thoughts around additional relief funding for the hospital industry? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Yes, so Frank let me speak to the ability to respond downsize, upsize, and respond again. I think we've proven to ourselves as I mentioned an ability to manage through that operationally as a facility and as a company. Also think, government -- many state governments have learned how to respond and to dial up, dial down maybe some of their policies. I think this is my judgment only those individuals understand how to dial up, dial down their social activities in a way that is responsive to what's going on in their communities as well. So, I think all of this is creating a bit of muscle memory, if you will, with respect to COVID-19. It's our belief that we're going to have to maintain that memory, use that memory again and be able to deal with the potential flare off that might occur until we have a vaccine or a different kind of therapeutic remedy that would allow for less COVID activity in our communities. So, I think it's not just us, it's policies, it's business, it's individuals, all taking advantage of these learnings and applying them to the situations that we believe will still exist in the future until there is some vaccine. So, Bill.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Frank, I think it's too early to talk about the profitability of COVID patients. What we do know early on is that our COVID patients that we saw did have a generally a higher acuity than our typical medical patient, just given a longer length of stay, a higher proportion in intensive care units. So, and there were some add-on payments by Medicare, as we know but too early to really convert that to profitability. Our focus is really making sure that we've got all the resources to be able to care for those patients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Your line is open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. First, just wanted to clarify, you said June inpatient admission was about 1% and July inpatient was running ahead or was that commentary just on Texas? And then more specifically on the ER volume, I know down 33%, what are some of the initiatives you're working on to get maybe people more comfortable to come in, if any, and then you've been talking for a while on access points and increasing those access points. Where are you with that and how does the backdrop sort of change or accelerate that? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Thank you, Ralph. So, what I mentioned, this is Sam. What I mentioned on July was that our inpatient census was up over June. We haven't finished the month yet. So, it's difficult to say exactly where admissions are going to be. With respect to emergency room activity, again, we saw sequential improvement in the rate of decline in our emergency room business in the second quarter with June being down, maybe half of what it was down or third less what was the third, 15% down versus a roughly 40% down, I think it was in April. So, we saw significant improvement, if you will, from the rate of decline. What we also saw inside of our emergency room business was greater acuity. We had similar to our inpatient, a bit business, greater acuity in our ER patients who visited our facilities and that yielded revenue per ER, visit that was slightly above our expectations. So, the business that we're losing is the lower acute business, which you would expect. We saw within our freestanding emergency rooms slightly quicker ramp up than we did our hospital-based ERs. Again, some of that could be due to patient concerns with respect to COVID. We have a very aggressive campaign, both operationally from a patient safety standpoint, as well as a communication standpoint with our patients on demonstrating to them, the safe environment that they deserve when they come to one of our facilities. As it relates to developing our outpatient platform, in order to support our hospitals, we continue on that pathway. We think it's an important part of taking the care experience to the patient, creating a more efficient, and a better price point for them. And we will continue to invest in that platform. We currently have a number of our outpatient facilities that are reopening as a result of the COVID pandemic closures that took place. So, each week we opened more of what we had previously close. We're not up to a 100% reopening of our freestanding ERs in some markets or urgent care centers and other markets. On top of that will be telemedicine. We have, as I mentioned in my comments developed rather quickly, a telemedicine capability, which is critically important, we think to furthering our access strategies for our patient and creating convenience for them and efficiency for our physicians. So, we will continue to invest in that and build capabilities that support that as a wraparound platform. So, I'm very encouraged about what we have done. I'm encouraged about what we're seeing in the recovery in these outpatient activities. And as we move forward, I anticipate that we will continue to develop these wraparound capabilities that support our facility, our hospitals in a way that make it easy for our patients. And then if they need deeper care, they can get more sophisticated and deeper care inside of our hospitals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ranson of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJohn Ransom: Hey, good morning. I'll add my congratulations. That's remarkable job in an unprecedented situation. I'm curious, as we look at July and you've got at least temporarily some inpatient capacity constraints in Texas and Florida. Have you been able to either through flexing capacity or moving things to outpatient? Have you been able to move material amount of maybe what would have been an impatient elective a year ago into a different setting? Or is it kind of looked like it did before?\nSam Hazen: Thanks, John. Well, I think, this is Sam again. What we have done with capacity management to deal with COVID is quite remarkable. We've developed technology capabilities to give us real time insights into our patient population into every bed in the facility at any point in time. Also giving us an indication of their clinical condition allowing us to think about and work with their physician to possibly place them in different settings. That has allowed us to increase the throughput in many respects, versus what we were able to do in the past. So that's an outgrowth of what happened during COVID that we think is going to create value for our patients, create better use of our assets in the future and create more value for our payer, partners in the future as well. The other thing that we've done during COVID is we have been able to what we call level load patients across our network. And by that, I mean getting patients into the right facility, even when we know we're going to have a pressure point at a particular facility because of the community issues that are going on. So, moving patients to where we had staffing or moving patients to where we had beds was another piece of capabilities. I think we advanced. We do that all the time with Hurricane, as we deal with hurricanes. But we took our hurricane learnings and applied that to COVID situations where we had stress. The area where we've seen slight acceleration of inpatient to outpatient over what we saw pre-COVID is in some of our surgical cases, mainly orthopedic total joints, where there was a natural progression of inpatient to outpatient. It's slightly higher post-COVID than it was pre- COVID. It's not significantly higher, but it is higher. And is that something that's going to continue? We believe that it will be there. We anticipated in our planning, our multiyear planning those orthopedic total joints would continue to migrate to more outpatient activity. But we're built for that. We collaborated with our physicians on making sure that we're dealing with the patient in the proper setting. We have an ambulatory surgery center platform, that if that's the best setting, they can go to that. So, we have prepared ourselves for this migration. Outside of total joints, I wouldn't submit that there's anything material that's taken place. That's been part of our overall capacity management. It needs to be clinically driven, not capacity driven. And as long as it's clinically effective for the patient, and will support that and hopefully accomplish that in a way that's productive for the capacity and at the same time appropriate for the patient.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from line of Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks and appreciate the work you did, but also taking the question here. So, mine on the CARES Act funding, you received, I think, a total of $1.4 billion plus an additional $300 million after the quarter. You recognize $822 million. And I understand the difference between the general distributions of $920 million and then the more targeted what seems like $750 million or so. So, I guess the question is do you think you're going to be able to actually recognize even that incremental $100 million or $98 million of the general distribution, or any of the targeted distributions? You just not seen that level of impact either volumes or costs?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Joshua. This is Bill. Let me try to highlight that. As you might know, the terms and conditions and general guidance for these funds continue to evolve and update. And for the most part, you have a 90 day or longer period to go through an analysis and attestation process. And we're in the middle of our analysis and validation procedures for those funds right now. So, it's really too early to talk about when and how much we might recognize in the future. We continue to monitor the guidance that comes out from various government agencies and we continue to do our analysis for the targeted funds. We have till mid to late third quarter or even July in the fourth quarter. So, we'll continue our analysis and go forward and we'll discuss really what that results when we go through future periods.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Scott Fidel of Stephens. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. And thanks for fitting me in here. I've just had one other CARES question as well and just relating to the Medicare advance payments that you and the others have receive at the industry. And I know those payments are supposed to get started to get paid back in August and over the course of eight months. Obviously, still a lot of virus impact and it seems like a lot of other hospitals in the industry are facing a lot of financial pressure still. So just interested if you're hearing any or you have any line of discussions with CMS in terms of them maybe looking to delay in terms of when facilities are required to start repaying those Medicare advance funding that was paid out of 2Q.\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Scott. This is Bill. I know there's been some discussion, but I don't have any insight into how those have progressed. As you probably know, it's scheduled to be repaid and offset against Medicare claims in the future beginning in August. So, we'll just have to see what that cadence goes. But I know there's been some discussion, we read about some potential altering how those funds and what the time period may be. But I don't have any insight on what ultimately may come from those discussions.\nMark Kimbrough: All right, Scott. Thank you for the question. Appreciate it. All right. Listen, thank you. I want to thank everybody who joined us today and participated on the call. As always, we're here to answer any of your questions. And so, take care. Have a good day and be safe. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional information on the quarter. As we expected, the second quarter saw progressive improvement each month of the quarter as we evolved from the initial response phase early in the quarter, and then enter the reboot phase during the second half of the quarter. We saw an improvement from the middle of April, which was our low volume point throughout the quarter in most every volume statistic. Our same facility admissions declined 12.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year period, and the monthly progression as Sam mentioned in his comments on admissions occurred with most of our key volume indicators. Same facility inpatient surgeries declined 15.7% in the quarter, with April declining about 38%, May was down 12% and June was up 3% over the prior year. Same facility hospital-based outpatient surgeries were down about 27% in the quarter, with April down about 65%, May down about 19% in June was up 4% from the prior year. Our outpatient surgeries in our ambulatory surgery centers were down about 40% in the quarter with April down 85% May down 32% and June was up 1% over the prior year. Our teams did an incredible job of managing our cost structure during this period of significant volume and revenue fluctuation during the quarter. We began adjusting most of our discretionary and variable expenses in late March and April, when the volume declines were most pronounced. We were able to sustain many of the expense improvements throughout the quarter as the volumes began to improve in May and June. As reflected in our financial statements, our reported revenues declined about $1.5 billion, or 12.2% in the quarter from the prior year period. Our salaries and benefits supplies and other operating expenses collectively declined approximately $1.1 billion or 10.5% during the quarter compared to the prior year. This is a testament to our management teams across the company, and highlights our ability to adequately adjust to the sudden volume declines as well as efficiently serve the increased volumes we saw during the reboot phase. Let me highlight a couple of other important items in the quarter starting with the CARES Act. As we discussed last quarter, the company is very appreciative of the government's recognition of the significant impact this pandemic has had on healthcare providers across the country. As I alluded to previously, our revenue was significantly impacted during the quarter due to this pandemic and the subsequent stopping of most elective procedures. In addition, we experienced significant costs in the preparation and response phase, including our pandemic pay program, other employee assistance efforts, as well as securing adequate supply chain items. We believe the CARES Act funding was developed to account for this volume disruption and to offset some of these costs, both of which began impacting us in the first quarter and to ensure healthcare providers across the country could continue to offer critical services to the communities they serve. As noted in our release and financial statements, we recognized $822 million of government stimulus income from the CARES Act during the quarter. This equates to about $590 million on an after-tax basis. As of June 30th, we had received approximately $1.4 billion of CARES Act stimulus funding. This included about $920 million from the general distribution and about $450 million from certain targeted distributions for rural and safety net hospitals, as well as hotspot funding. We have not recognized any of the targeted distributions in our P&L as of June 30th, as we are still performing the required analysis and attestation process. The evaluation period and guidance related to the relief fund continue to evolve and as a result, we've recognized $822 million of the $920 million in general distribution funds received in the quarter. Subsequent to June 30th, we've received approximately $300 million in additional targeted distribution funds. Before I conclude, let me speak briefly to some cash flow balance sheet and liquidity metrics. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, the company took a number of measures early in this pandemic cycle, including entering into a $2 billion short term credit facility, suspending our share repurchase program and quarterly dividend, as well as reducing planned capital expenditures. These were in addition to a number of operational adjustments, we mentioned earlier. All of these efforts have enhanced the company's liquidity and capability to manage through these uncertain times. As of June 30th, 2020, the company had $7.7 billion of capacity under our credit facilities and $4.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Our debt to EBITDA leverage was 2.7x as of June 30th, 2020, after netting out our cash on the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $8.72 billion for the quarter, which includes the following components. We received approximately $4.4 billion in advanced Medicare payments during the quarter. These amounts are scheduled to be repaid over an eight-month period, beginning in August of 2020. Cash flow from operations was also fairly impacted by the approximate $1.4 billion of CARES Act funding received during the quarter, I mentioned earlier, as well as the deferral of estimated income tax payments to the third quarter of approximately $200 million and payroll tax deferrals, that will be paid in late 2021 and 2022 of approximately $200 million. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, we've reduced the company's plan capital expenditures. At this point, we anticipate reducing our capital spending to approximately $2.8 billion to $3 billion for 2020, as compared to our original plan of approximately $4.2 billion for the year. This remains subject to further evaluation of operating trends and opportunities. In short, we believe the steps that we implemented have enhanced the company's financial flexibility as we navigate these unprecedented times. We continue to believe the strength, scale and resiliency of HCA are longstanding and critical attributes that served us well, not only during this past quarter, but we'll continue to service as we can go through the future cycles of this pandemic. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mark and we'll open it up for Q&A. Hey, good morning, Justin. So, let me start with that and I'll pass Sam to add in. So, as we mentioned, I think the acuity of the patients that returned were a higher than they were pre-pandemic. As we saw some of our higher acuity patients in cardiology, neurosciences and orthopedics returned. And the lower acuity patients were maybe the ones that will take a little bit longer to return. In addition, we had favorable kind of ICU and NICU days. There was a high that contributed to the acuity. And so, I do think that the margin generations of those higher acuity patients as they return were higher than normal and what they were pre-pandemic. As we mentioned throughout our prepared remarks, we're very pleased with the response of our operating teams and the efforts we are able to make around discretionary costs and managing the variable cost. And we're very pleased with how we finished the quarter on that. Sam, do you want to give any comments on going forward? Yes, AJ, this is Bill. We think it was prudent at the time to reduce our capital spending, as we talked about last quarter and updated on this quarter, most of those projects were either deferral or slowing down some activity that was in the pipeline, as well as some deferral of our IT capital. We don't believe any of those decisions have compromised the strategic or growth initiative for us at this point, actually during the quarter, we turned on a couple of projects that we felt there was compelling opportunities out there. As far as next year, we'll have to see what the marketplace and the environment is. I don't think just because we deferred these, that we'll have to substantially increase over what we ordinarily would have planned, but we'll continue to evaluate that as we go through these different cycles. Yes, Pito, this is Bill. Let me give a start to that. I think generally speaking, we can hold much of the cost controls that we put in place, as we said, most of those were around adjusting some of our discretionary spending, as well as some of the variable cost, like as Sam mentioned in his comments. We do know this recent COVID surge, we have to make sure we have the appropriate labor to serve that surge that may result in some increase use of either contract or premium labor. But I think as a whole, our teams have done a nice job. We continue to have opportunities to continue to look at other discretionary spending that we have. So, I think we've got a little bit of a track record of being able to manage to the environment, managed to the revenue that we have. We're very pleased with the results and we'll just going to have to see how the volume returns. And what are the variable costs that we're going to need to support that. But we feel for the most part, we can hold much of the expense adjustments that we made during the quarter. Yes, this is Bill. As we mentioned in the payer mix, we did see some favorable in the payer mix as our commercial declines were a little less than or Medicare declines which makes sense that that the Medicare population may take a little bit longer time to return to a healthcare facility. Our uninsured volumes remained consistent with our overall volumes that we haven't seen any material kind of differential with our self-pay volume. Going forward, that's obviously an area that we're paying attention to. We're doing a lot of study market by market to track various factors, whether that be unemployment or coverage. I think it is too early to be able to predict how that may unfold. But clearly some of those factors will contribute to some of the uncertainty as we face the future. And factor into some of our decision. But we haven't seen a play out right now. But as we go forward, it's an area that we continue to monitor. And we have some data that we're trying to track to give us some insight as we go into our 2021 planning cycle. Yes, Steven. This is Bill. Let me try. I think the reality is there are still many unknowns relative to the duration and impact this pandemic will have. One of the reasons we cannot update or guidance at this point. It's unclear the longer-term macroeconomic impact of how this might change the overall landscape including patient behavior, the economy, employment and coverage and alike. So, these are kind of somewhat unprecedented times for so it's really hard to really project on a quarter by quarter basis what we might see. What we do know is that we've demonstrated and I think as we demonstrated in this quarter, we have plans in place to respond I think to a range of scenarios that might unfold. And we have different stages of management actions based on how either volume returns or what that makes may be and alike. So, we'll continue to assess the market, let you know what we're seeing as we go through the year. But right now, we're just unable to convert that to any type of financial guidance going forward and we just have to wait to see how the market place unfolds. Yes. Frank, I think it's too early to talk about the profitability of COVID patients. What we do know early on is that our COVID patients that we saw did have a generally a higher acuity than our typical medical patient, just given a longer length of stay, a higher proportion in intensive care units. So, and there were some add-on payments by Medicare, as we know but too early to really convert that to profitability. Our focus is really making sure that we've got all the resources to be able to care for those patients. Yes, Joshua. This is Bill. Let me try to highlight that. As you might know, the terms and conditions and general guidance for these funds continue to evolve and update. And for the most part, you have a 90 day or longer period to go through an analysis and attestation process. And we're in the middle of our analysis and validation procedures for those funds right now. So, it's really too early to talk about when and how much we might recognize in the future. We continue to monitor the guidance that comes out from various government agencies and we continue to do our analysis for the targeted funds. We have till mid to late third quarter or even July in the fourth quarter. So, we'll continue our analysis and go forward and we'll discuss really what that results when we go through future periods. Yes, Scott. This is Bill. I know there's been some discussion, but I don't have any insight into how those have progressed. As you probably know, it's scheduled to be repaid and offset against Medicare claims in the future beginning in August. So, we'll just have to see what that cadence goes. But I know there's been some discussion, we read about some potential altering how those funds and what the time period may be. But I don't have any insight on what ultimately may come from those discussions."

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining today's call. The second quarter was a remarkable 91 days for the company, possibly the most remarkable I've experienced in my 37 years with the organization. It started with a level of uncertainty and uneasiness that was very high as the pandemic began, the middle part was filled with example, after example of people inside our company, stepping up and delivering for each other and delivering for our patients. All the while strengthening our culture of taking care of others in the right way, whenever we are needed. And finally, it ended with the prowess of our teams on display, showing their abilities to manage relationships with their employees, respond to the needs of their physicians, deliver on operational adjustments that were necessary, given the circumstances and build clinical capabilities that not only give us more confidence in responding effectively to the ongoing challenges and resurgence of this pandemic, but provide us capabilities to improve our services and create even more value in the future. I've never been more proud to work with this company that I am now. As a shareholder, I hope you are equally as proud to be associated with HCA Healthcare. From day one, we addressed the pandemic with two clear objectives. The first was to protect our people that is keep them safe and keep them employed, giving them the assurances they needed both at work and at home. The second was to protect the company and that is protecting its financial positions, so we can continue to serve our communities for years to come. Both of these objectives endure today and directed by the guiding principles we laid out at the beginning of the pandemic, they allow us to provide the care patients deserve. Thus far, we have been able to achieve these foundational objectives because of the partnership and hard work of our 280,000 colleagues and 45,000 physicians. I want to thank them for their unwavering commitment and tremendous sacrifices in the midst of this global health crisis. In addition, thorough planning, solid execution, appropriate resource allocation and focus leadership all contributed to numerous positive outcomes. We also had strong collaboration with our partners, health plans, lab companies, suppliers, post-acute providers and others who I also want to thank. Every corner of this organization has come together to do what's right. In times of great uncertainty, our people continue to show up and pursue the path forward. We press on in that journey now. In pursue of the first objective, we implemented a number of pandemic pay programs to support our colleagues, including a program that continued income for them that otherwise would have ceased due to stay at home orders and reduce patient volumes. 145,000 colleagues benefited from these programs at a cost to the company of approximately $110 million. As a result, and I'm proud of this fact, not one employee in HCA Healthcare has been laid off or furloughed due to the pandemic. The HCA Hope Fund raised $4.5 million during the quarter and unprecedented level of contributions from employees, our board and the First Foundation. This year the fund has provided almost $2 million in grants to employees who needed emergency support. Our mission is to care for and improve human life, which primarily revolves around our patients, but it also, revolves around our employees. Truly, we care like family. Today, HCA Healthcare is taking care of more than 33,000 COVID-19 inpatients including over 5,000 patients who are currently in-house. Throughout this pandemic, we have developed more enterprise capabilities to respond to this crisis giving us greater confidence as we address the resurgence and the many challenges that exist in the communities that we serve. Examples of these capabilities include; enhanced clinical management protocols for patients on ventilators, increased lab testing capacity and improved turnaround times for results, currently 90% of COVID-19 lab results are produced in less than 48 hours, more sophisticated supply chain systems and logistics management, we have distributed over 20 million pieces of personal protective equipment to care givers. Additionally, we rapidly developed and deployed applications that manage capacity in case management requirements, increase telemedicine product offerings in capacity, we performed over 500,000 telemedicine visits in the quarter which was well above prior levels. And finally, we initiated various clinical research projects that should improve patient care in the future. Now let me transition to the earnings report. Like the first quarter, our business was significantly limited by governmental policies that restricted elective procedures and required communities to shelter at home. As many of our markets begin to reopen in May, patient volumes improved as our teams executed their reboot plans. Over the course of successive two-week period, we saw sequential improvements in most categories, ending the quarter with modest growth in admissions. For the quarter, admissions were down almost 13%. April was down 27%, May was down 12% and June was up 1%. Outpatient volumes across most categories also improved sequentially during the quarter, but we did not reach last year's level for any service. Emergency room visits and outpatient surgeries were each down 33% in the quarter. On the revenue side, the qualitative aspects of our inpatient -- specifically the following two factors drove a 10% increase year-over-year in inpatient revenue per admission. First, the overall acuity was higher with case mix index growing 3% and second, payer mix was better with commercial business representing 28% of admissions as compared to 26% last year. As a result, inpatient revenue was only down around 4%. Outpatient revenue declined 30% and in total, revenue decreased 12% as compared to the second quarter last year. The improvement in our financial results was generally better and broader than we expected but we believe it is too early for us to make any conclusive statements about the future or provide any guidance for the rest of the year. As we manage the company through these remarkable times, we are mindful of our mission as well as the many uncertainties that remain with respect to the broader recovery of the economy, uninsured levels, government regulations, state budgets and the resurgence and duration of COVID-19. In my comments last quarter, I spoke about the three-stage cost reduction plan we developed to respond to the different scenarios we had modeled. During the second quarter, we implemented first stage items and also many second stage items. Our teams did a masterful job in executing these plans. In the quarter, salaries and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses collectively declined approximately 11% as compared to the prior year. For the quarter, we reported pretax government stimulus income from the CARES Act of $822 million, which reduced expenses further and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.73. In sum, our overall performance was better than we expected, with diluted earnings per share of $3.16, an increase of 46% as compared to the second quarter last year. We continue to maintain a close watch on the macroeconomic factors that influence our business. Again, as we get further into the year, and gain a greater visibility into these factors and the performance of the company. We hope to be in a better position to evaluate the capital and operational decisions that we made earlier in the pandemic. Currently, we are dealing with resurgence of COVID-19 and many of our communities in particular Texas and Florida. We made the decision across both states to restrict elective procedures where appropriate, freeing up capacity and staffing while preserving PPE. We continue to work with state and local governments to coordinate community wide efforts. Thus far, we have been able to manage the situation and also provide non-elective care to non-COVID patients who need it. I mentioned in my comments last quarter that I had faith in our team's abilities to adjust their operations. And I believe they would once again respond to this challenge and deliver results. As you can see, they did it again. We are fortunate to have can do teams. I'm confident they will continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. Even though the second quarter felt a lot longer to me the 91 days. I'm reminded once again, what an incredible and resilient organization we have. One that is driven by common purpose to do the right thing for others. As I've highlighted today, we accomplished a lot during this time across multiple dimensions of our business. These accomplishments, I believe, will position us well for long-term success and continue to the great legacy that is HCA Healthcare. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill Rutherford for more details on our financial results. Well, let me speak to Texas and Florida. Those are the two states where we have seen COVID-19 resurgence at its greatest level. We have other components of our company where we are seeing COVID volumes, but they're not to the level that we had seen in Texas and are seeing in Florida. In Texas which was a little bit ahead of Florida, if you will, with respect to the resurgence. I think the company has done an incredible job at responding to the needs of our communities, as have our competitors. And I think it's a testament to the healthcare system in the country, and its ability to respond to these challenges from one place to the other. What we've seen in Texas is that our volume for COVID patients have peaked and actually started to decline. Whereas in Florida, we've seen a flattening out in a very modest growth rate over the last week. And we hope Florida is maybe a week behind what's going on inside of Texas. In total, our activity levels are up slightly in July as compared to June with respect to overall in patient census. Clearly with our decision to restrict elective care to manage our response to the community, we have seen a slowdown in surgical activities. But we anticipate recovering that at some point in the future as we get better visibility into the COVID cases in the different communities. Our teams have done an incredible job as I mentioned in my comments. Our physicians have supported our teams incredibly well. And then our corporate and other teams have made capabilities available to our institutions, allowing us to respond very appropriately. So, I'm really pleased with our outcomes. And we do believe that we're going to have to manage through COVID again. It's not something that's going to go away necessarily. But our ability to scale up, scale down, scale up, I think is now been proven. We've gained greater confidence in our ability to run our business, and at the same time respond to surges. And so, the execution and the agility that our facilities and our teams have showed over this period of time helps us in developing learnings that we will be able to advance as we go forward on into this year. All right, thanks, Gary. Well, we have not restricted elective procedures or surgeries in markets where we don't have a need to respond to COVID. So obviously, in Texas it started out, in Houston in the Valley and those were the first markets where we implemented our elective procedure decisions. Then as it expanded to San Antonio, we replicated that in that market so it's sequenced based upon the circumstances and it will unsequence if you will, based upon the circumstances. So, in Dallas, for example which is not as significantly impacted by COVID, we've started to relax some of our procedure, requirements and restrictions in order to deal with the circumstances in those communities. So, we're going to see some natural ebb and flow in Florida similarly and then if we were to see it somewhere else, we would use those experiences that we learned in Texas, in Miami as an example to manage the situation. And this is what we're required to do with respect to our responsibilities as community infrastructure. We take it seriously and we think we've been able to prove to ourselves and prove to the community that we can respond effectively to the needs of our patients whatever COVID does surface at a level that's much greater than what we were seeing in April and May. And we had some of this activity in June in some markets where we had COVID surge going on. It wasn't as hot profile as what it was in Texas and Florida. Again, we were managing through that within our portfolio similarly in learning from that Gary and putting those learnings into our experiences now. And I'm confident that we will continue to learn and gain greater capabilities in managing the volume requirements in the ups and downs of this particular pandemic. Okay, A.J. it's Sam. Thank you for the question. What I'll give you some observations. It's really difficult for us to pinpoint precisely what's going on in these circumstances. But we believe that approximately 40% to 50% of the deferred cases during the six to seven week period where most of our company was restricted on what we can do have been recaptured. And by recaptured, I mean either done or scheduled. So, the other 40% to 50% that hasn't been recaptured, we don't have visibility into the timing of that yet. Our positions continue to build back their practices just as we're building back our business in a way that should hopefully recapture some of that gap that I just mentioned, but we don't have great visibility into that as of yet. What I will tell you also is that, our ambulatory surgery centers were slower in their ramp up because they were at a complete stop versus our hospitals, which were continuing to run during the pandemic period. And so, they have ramped a little bit slower as Bill alluded to in his comment. What we saw within our surgery was procedures, orthopedic, spine, general surgery recovered quicker and stronger. We also saw a slower recovery in our GI procedures and certain diagnostic categories, which started to ramp significantly at the end of June, which gives us a belief that downstream those diagnostic patients and encounters will ultimately require some level of therapy, whether it's surgery or something else. So, we have some insights into it. We believe we'll need through the third quarter, probably through the fourth quarter to have a better sense of what the full recapture was of the cases that were in fact deferred. In cardiology, components of our cardiology business recovered really well, mainly electrophysiology and the procedures in that particular category. So, we had a mixed bag of events in the second quarter. And there are some indications of decent recovery in certain service lines, still more to come in others, and we will continue to monitor and try to gain insights from within our physician practices, whether they're affiliated or employed and within the different markets that we think are more advanced in their recovery period than others. And let that inform some of our observations further as we go into this next quarter. Thank you, Matt. This is Sam, Matt. I don't know that we have any insights yet -- market insights into competitor issues or opportunities that might exist. I think everybody is scrambling in many markets to deal with COVID-19 and discharge their responsibilities appropriately. And the likelihood of any strategic decisions being made during this particular period in time I think is probably not that high. We will continue to explore. We have a very robust pipeline for outpatient facility development and/ or acquisitions that we're very excited about. And they're complementing of our existing networks. And we'll continue to look for adjacency -- with adjacencies within that platform, as it relates to new market opportunities, and so forth, I would just have to be, I think aware and open to those but very conservative and appropriate and how we think about them. And capital allocation, as Bill just alluded to in our planning. I don't know though, at this point in time that we're going to see anything in the short run. I think it's going to take systems a while to get through this period and then start to determine what their appropriate steps are. But as we've done in the past, we have been opportunistic, with respect to certain acquisitions. And we will continue to maintain that philosophy and appropriately move forward. So, here's how we looked at the recovery, we base lined everything off of April and we looked at May and June and highlighted within our portfolio what the revenue growth was in each of those months' vis-a-vis April. And for the most part, we had remarkably consistent performance across the divisions with the exception of a couple of spots. Those two spots were out West in California primarily and then, in Miami secondarily. And that was because of releasing the restrictions a little bit slower in parts of California than Texas and Tennessee and places like that as an example and then Miami was dealing with COVID in a totally different scenario and their restrictions were released a little bit differently. But within those two brackets, most of our divisions ramped reasonably consistent as it relates to their revenue growth over April. And so that's how we judged it, again it's very difficult for us to get very specific observations from one category to the other within procedures and so forth but looking at the revenue recovery as the better metric, we were able to see remarkable consistency across the rest of the company with respect to gains over April. Yes, so Frank let me speak to the ability to respond downsize, upsize, and respond again. I think we've proven to ourselves as I mentioned an ability to manage through that operationally as a facility and as a company. Also think, government -- many state governments have learned how to respond and to dial up, dial down maybe some of their policies. I think this is my judgment only those individuals understand how to dial up, dial down their social activities in a way that is responsive to what's going on in their communities as well. So, I think all of this is creating a bit of muscle memory, if you will, with respect to COVID-19. It's our belief that we're going to have to maintain that memory, use that memory again and be able to deal with the potential flare off that might occur until we have a vaccine or a different kind of therapeutic remedy that would allow for less COVID activity in our communities. So, I think it's not just us, it's policies, it's business, it's individuals, all taking advantage of these learnings and applying them to the situations that we believe will still exist in the future until there is some vaccine. So, Bill. Thank you, Ralph. So, what I mentioned, this is Sam. What I mentioned on July was that our inpatient census was up over June. We haven't finished the month yet. So, it's difficult to say exactly where admissions are going to be. With respect to emergency room activity, again, we saw sequential improvement in the rate of decline in our emergency room business in the second quarter with June being down, maybe half of what it was down or third less what was the third, 15% down versus a roughly 40% down, I think it was in April. So, we saw significant improvement, if you will, from the rate of decline. What we also saw inside of our emergency room business was greater acuity. We had similar to our inpatient, a bit business, greater acuity in our ER patients who visited our facilities and that yielded revenue per ER, visit that was slightly above our expectations. So, the business that we're losing is the lower acute business, which you would expect. We saw within our freestanding emergency rooms slightly quicker ramp up than we did our hospital-based ERs. Again, some of that could be due to patient concerns with respect to COVID. We have a very aggressive campaign, both operationally from a patient safety standpoint, as well as a communication standpoint with our patients on demonstrating to them, the safe environment that they deserve when they come to one of our facilities. As it relates to developing our outpatient platform, in order to support our hospitals, we continue on that pathway. We think it's an important part of taking the care experience to the patient, creating a more efficient, and a better price point for them. And we will continue to invest in that platform. We currently have a number of our outpatient facilities that are reopening as a result of the COVID pandemic closures that took place. So, each week we opened more of what we had previously close. We're not up to a 100% reopening of our freestanding ERs in some markets or urgent care centers and other markets. On top of that will be telemedicine. We have, as I mentioned in my comments developed rather quickly, a telemedicine capability, which is critically important, we think to furthering our access strategies for our patient and creating convenience for them and efficiency for our physicians. So, we will continue to invest in that and build capabilities that support that as a wraparound platform. So, I'm very encouraged about what we have done. I'm encouraged about what we're seeing in the recovery in these outpatient activities. And as we move forward, I anticipate that we will continue to develop these wraparound capabilities that support our facility, our hospitals in a way that make it easy for our patients. And then if they need deeper care, they can get more sophisticated and deeper care inside of our hospitals. Thanks, John. Well, I think, this is Sam again. What we have done with capacity management to deal with COVID is quite remarkable. We've developed technology capabilities to give us real time insights into our patient population into every bed in the facility at any point in time. Also giving us an indication of their clinical condition allowing us to think about and work with their physician to possibly place them in different settings. That has allowed us to increase the throughput in many respects, versus what we were able to do in the past. So that's an outgrowth of what happened during COVID that we think is going to create value for our patients, create better use of our assets in the future and create more value for our payer, partners in the future as well. The other thing that we've done during COVID is we have been able to what we call level load patients across our network. And by that, I mean getting patients into the right facility, even when we know we're going to have a pressure point at a particular facility because of the community issues that are going on. So, moving patients to where we had staffing or moving patients to where we had beds was another piece of capabilities. I think we advanced. We do that all the time with Hurricane, as we deal with hurricanes. But we took our hurricane learnings and applied that to COVID situations where we had stress. The area where we've seen slight acceleration of inpatient to outpatient over what we saw pre-COVID is in some of our surgical cases, mainly orthopedic total joints, where there was a natural progression of inpatient to outpatient. It's slightly higher post-COVID than it was pre- COVID. It's not significantly higher, but it is higher. And is that something that's going to continue? We believe that it will be there. We anticipated in our planning, our multiyear planning those orthopedic total joints would continue to migrate to more outpatient activity. But we're built for that. We collaborated with our physicians on making sure that we're dealing with the patient in the proper setting. We have an ambulatory surgery center platform, that if that's the best setting, they can go to that. So, we have prepared ourselves for this migration. Outside of total joints, I wouldn't submit that there's anything material that's taken place. That's been part of our overall capacity management. It needs to be clinically driven, not capacity driven. And as long as it's clinically effective for the patient, and will support that and hopefully accomplish that in a way that's productive for the capacity and at the same time appropriate for the patient."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and instructions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead.\nMark Kimbrough: Thank you, Marcella. Good morning. And welcome to all of you on today's call and our webcast. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and CFO, Bill Rutherford. And also joining us this morning is Dr. Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Officer. Sam and Bill will provide comments on the company's first quarter results and also the company's response to COVID-19. Then we'll open up for questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, numerous risk, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and those factors are listed in today's press release and our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses or gains on the sales of facilities, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in today's first quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. I will now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Good morning. And thank you for joining the call. I will focus my comments this morning on the COVID-19 pandemic and direct you to our earnings release for the financial results for the first quarter. In general, the first 80% of the quarter was very similar to the growth we have experienced over the past two years, and was a reflection of the momentum we had heading into the year. Then the effects of the pandemic begin to hit us in mid-March. We will answer any questions you have about the first quarter's results following our comments. The early planning and preparations we did for COVID-19 involved updating clinical policies and operational guidance, preparing supply chain with added inventory levels for key personal protective equipment, drugs and ventilator equipment. It also included building approaches to add capacity for potential surge in patient volumes, leveraging data, initiating our emergency operations center and refining our management structure to execute. Like most things in our company, the basic approach was to find ways to maximize unique enterprise capability, leverage financial resources and further develop corporate relationships with other to support our hospitals. HCA Healthcare has a storied history of responding well to disasters, such as natural disasters like hurricanes and floods, as well as mass casualty events like the concert shooting in Las Vegas. We used these past experiences to guide and inform the planning and response during the crisis, which was the first one we would face at enterprise scale. This event has required us to respond differently with a structure that included a more balanced approach between corporate support, division coordination and facility execution. As part of our plan, we developed five guiding principles that established a framework for decision making and actions through the crisis. These principles are simple yet extremely powerful and they endure today. They are as follows; first, protect our employees and physicians; second, be there for patients; third, partner with others; next, be a resource for communities and government; and last, accelerate the company through the crisis. We started this effort and we still remain focused on protecting the safety and health of our employees and physicians as the first principle. We enhanced training, established better PPE acquisition, distribution and control systems, implemented a universal masking policy and improved lab testing turnaround time as part of this endeavor. We have cared for approximately 5,500 positive COVID-19 in-patients so far across the company. We were early to implement universal masking of care providers and to-date we have had limited exposures to employees and doctors. A strong corporate culture is the bedrock of HCA Healthcare. This event has reinforced its importance and provided us with an opportunity to see it in action every day. Our dedicated and caring employees are the lifeblood of the company. To-date, we have not laid off or furloughed one employee as a result of the pandemic. Instead, we adopted a pandemic pay program that supports approximately 80,000 employees who are not getting their normal hours as a result of reduced overall volume. Almost 11,000 corporate and division colleagues graciously took a salary cut of 10% to 30% for April and May, depending upon their compensation level as a show of solidarity for our caregivers in the hospital. Additionally, over 90% of our support staffs are working productively from home. This remote work model has provided insight into operational efficiencies for the future and is about one example of organizational learning from this event. To further support our colleagues, many within the organization have contributed to the HCA hope fund, which is a 501(c)3 charity that is exclusively focused on providing support to fellow colleagues when they experience hardships in their lives. In less than one month, the fund has received unprecedented levels of contribution from employees, board members and the Frist Foundation, a true testament to our culture, mission and value. Already, the whole front has over $1.3 million in grant applications that have either been paid or pending approval from more than 1200 employees. It is times like these that test whether we honor our mission or not. We choose to honor it. For Affiliated Physicians, we have implemented a COVID-19 response model that includes partnering with other technical experts to assist them with navigating the Cares Act and accessing certain benefits available to them. Also, HCA Healthcare is a large medical office landlord and we took a leadership position and many of our third-party developers have followed in implementing a rent deferral program, which addresses medical practice or business disruption and maintains availability of medical care and related services for patients and the community. This program, which is allowed through federal waivers, provides relief for our tenants over the next few months. We have also provided similar relief to physician partners and our ambulatory surgery centers. We have great relationships with our physicians and we wanted to help them through this difficult period. The second guiding principle was to be there for our patients and we have been. Our employees have shown up, our physicians have shown up, they have been on the front line and they have not wavered during this pandemic crisis in meeting their responsibilities of placing patients first. We've had ample capacity across our system to serve community needs. We have used the logistical capability of our supply chain to move supplies and ventilator equipment to needed hospitals. We have increased significantly telemedicine capabilities, the key patients in touch with their physicians. We have numerous research projects underway with our Sarah Cannon Research Institute as we continue to find ways to improve critical care medicine protocols for COVID-19 patients, lab testing methods, drug therapies and much more. And lastly, we have used our internal supplemental staffing organization to enhance personnel need when and where necessary across the enterprise. HCA Healthcare is a nation of heroes. I want to thank our colleagues and physicians for their unwavering commitment to patients, their tremendous sacrifice and hard work and their remarkable teamwork and dedication to each other. I salute them and I know their community salutes them as well. The third principle was to partner with others and forge new relationships. We have evolved existing relationships with other companies in the industry to collaborate and solve problems. We have developed new relationships that allowed us to accelerate protocols for in-patient COVID-19 testing that have become the norm for many health systems. We have partnered with a technology company to advance monitoring of community resources and illnesses. We believe these relationships and others will benefit us in the future as we see many opportunities for further enhancing our shared commitment and creating more value for patients and the communities we serve. I want to thank the leadership of these organizations for their collaboration and commitment to support our hospitals. The fourth guiding principle was to be a resource for the community and for government, both local and federal .we have collaborated with local health systems, health agencies, first responders and many more. Our teams are working directly with FEMA, CDC and recently we took a leadership position in developing with the federal government and the American Hospital Association a dynamic ventilator response network that will utilize excess inventories across the country to support needs in COVID-19 hotspots as they arise. We believe these types of public private sector partnerships are necessary and valuable in responding to a public health emergency of this type and in creating channels of understanding between sectors. And the last guiding principle was to accelerate HCA Healthcare through this crisis and position the company for success in the future. This principle means that we are focused on using this pandemic to learn more and to learn faster. It demonstrates also our capacity for improving and becoming more agile at planning, executing, communicating and processing solutions more effectively. And finally, this principle means that we as a company take steps to navigate appropriately through this difficult and uncertain period for the benefit of all stakeholders. We view our networks as part of and fundamental to community infrastructure. Across the 43 communities we serve, our local health systems have a sacred responsibility to always be there when needed. To meet this promise, we must take prudent and necessary actions. As part of our planning, we took a number of steps, which we believe are appropriate to protect the company and be there for the people we serve. The culture of HCA Healthcare is laser focused on the patient. Our strategy, our decisions and our resource allocation revolve around that. We also have a strong track record when it comes to making decisions that benefit our shareholders. The philosophy we have with respect to shareholder value remains. We continue to believe that a capital allocation strategy of reinvesting in our business and repurchasing stock will generate long-term value for the company. These strategies in the past dividends have benefited our shareholders. But given the uncertainty around this unprecedented pandemic, we felt it\u2019s prudent to adjust the company's current capital allocation strategy. First, we reduced capital spending by delaying certain projects and postponing various initiatives. Second, we suspended share buybacks under existing programs. And third, out an abundance of caution, we suspended the dividend. We will continue to review the capital allocation strategy as we always do and plan to determine the appropriate adjustments as we get better visibility into our business. As we look ahead to the next phases of this pandemic, which starts with the reboot of core operations, we have developed various scenarios to inform the ranges of management actions necessary to respond appropriately to them. These scenarios are built around three major variables. First, understanding the impact of the recently unemployed on payer mix is important, including how many people, either maintain existing employer sponsored insurance coverage through COBRA programs, move to coverage from products sold in the exchanges, enroll in Medicaid or become uninsured. Obviously, the timing of the economic recovery and government programs support will determine the outcome of this variable. The second variable relates to the rebound in volume. As directed by federal and state governments, we have suspended certain operations, especially elective business, which is mostly surgical and generally more profitable than medical business. Additionally, emergency room visits have declined significantly during this event, because of general concerns with COVID-19 and sheltering at home policies. Our modeling includes different levels and different timelines for their rebound. We are focused on a reboot plan that places us in the best possible position for success in resuming suspended operations. The reboot will require us to work with the governors on social distancing policies, which we believe will vary by market. We have to understand what physicians need to restart their practices. And finally, we have to respond to patients in a way that reassures them that we have the safe and protected care environment they deserve. We expect to bring on capacity in a conservative manner as markets allow and in the most efficient way possible during the reboot. At this point, we believe the reboot phase will be accomplished across most of the company by the end of the second quarter. The third variable is our cost reduction plan. We have developed three stages of cost reductions with each one being more significant should there be a longer time to recovery. We have already executed on most of the first stage items and now we are implementing aspects of the second stage as we look to enter the reboot phase. The third stage of our plan includes a response to a situation where we see structural changes to revenue. We will be vigilant about determining if this happens. But at this point, we believe it is too early to implement the measures in this third stage. We have demonstrated over the years the ability to respond and adjust operations to various conditions. I have faith in our team and believe that they will once again prove it in the face of this ongoing challenge. As I've said many times in the past, I believe HCA Healthcare is incredibly resilient, because of our dedicated people, the scale we have and the ability to leverage it uniquely to capitalize on business opportunities or address challenges. We believe our resiliency is further enhanced by our diversification of markets, diversification of services and a strong asset base, which can provide a certain level of strategic optionality and flexibility. We have seen it demonstrated over our 50 plus year existence, and I believe we will see it again. In closing, I say with confidence that we will get back to normal in time but we realize it maybe a new normal. Fortunately, I see HCA Healthcare as uniquely positioned to help define the new normal and capitalize on new opportunities. I want to thank our shareholders again for their support of HCA Healthcare. And now, I will turn the call over to Bill for a few more comments.\nBill Rutherford: Okay, great. Thank you, Sam and good morning everyone. Let me provide some additional information. We reported our quarterly results this morning. But as Sam mentioned, the quarter really had two distinct periods to it; the pre-pandemic period, which was January 1st through March 15th; and the last half of March where we began to see the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our reported same facility admission growth of 0.6% in the quarter comprised of about 5% growth through March 15th. Then for the last half of March, we saw an approximate 20% decline in admissions as compared to the prior year period. Almost all of our key volume indicators reflected growth through March 15th, and contractions in the last half of March as compared to the prior year period. Same facility emergency room visits grew about 5% through March 15th, and declined close to 30% in the last half of March as compared to the prior year. Same facility in-patient surgeries grew about 2% through March 15th and declined about 20% in the last half of March. Hospital-based outpatient surgeries grew about 2% through March 15th and declined about 30% in the last half of the month. Generally speaking, almost all volumes statistics were adversely affected and results were comparable among the payer classes. In essence, we saw strong results across the board until the impact of COVID-19 started to materialize in the last half of March. So rather than repeating all of our typical statistics let me discuss briefly what we see as the different phases as we navigate through this event, what we are seeing in April and most importantly, the actions we've taken as a management\u2019s team to guide the company through this period. First, as we think about the pandemic broadly, we see three phases that we believe will likely unfold in the coming months and quarters; a response phase, a restart and recovery phase. We are in the first response phase that was highlighted started with our planning in the first quarter. We then see moving to the restart phase as governmental restrictions on elect to procedures are lifted, as we work with our affiliated physicians on clinical and operational protocols and hopefully, we begin to see some reduction of COVID-19 activity. We are fully focused and have begun our planning for this restart process. We have multiple work streams around securing adequate laboratory testing capabilities, securing additional personal protective equipment, developing and providing surgical support and other important areas. Our focus is to be ready and have the capability to service the needs of our communities as quickly, confidently and safely as possible. We are preparing and will be ready to serve many of the procedures that have been deferred or cancelled.  While much depends on the easing of social and government restrictions, we believe this restart phase will begin towards the last half of the second quarter. After the restart phase, we believe we\u2019ll move into a recovery phase. Our base assumption has us occurring sometime during the summer. There will be many factors that influence how long this phase will last and what the impact will be to our operating results, but we are preparing for a range of scenarios with varying durations of the recovery period. We believe the extent of the COVID-19's impact on the company will depend on many factors. And we cannot predict the future implications this pandemic will have on our business trends at this time. As a result and highlight in our release, we are withdrawing our guidance for 2020. We do believe the impact to the company will be most pronounced during this current response phase as we continue to see volume declines in April. Thus far through April, our in-patient admissions are running about 30% below the prior year. Our emergency room visits are running about 50% below prior year as our in-patient surgeries. Our hospital based outpatient surgeries are running about 70% below our prior year as most elective procedures have been deferred. We have started to see these volume declines stabilize over the past week. We believe we will begin to see some recovery of these volumes as different regions of the country begin to open up during the second half of the quarter. So before I talk about some of our future planning, let me highlight some of the actions and precautionary measures we have already taken to strengthen the company's financial flexibility. First, due to our early planning, we entered into $2 billion short-term credit facility to provide the company with additional liquidity. As of March 31st, we had $3.8 billion of liquidity available under our credit facilities. In addition, we took a series of other actions to strengthen the company's financial position. We suspended our share repurchase program on March 13th. We also began to reduce the company's planned capital expenditures. And at this point, anticipate reducing our capital spending anywhere from $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the remaining part of 2020. We expect this will be accomplished from deferring new project starts, reducing some technology capital spending, as well as reducing some retained capital expenditures. Out of an abundance of caution, we also announced this morning the suspension of our dividend program. We expect to evaluate resumption of the dividend program at a future date. Our operating teams have also implemented a series of cost management strategies, including hiring and travel freezes, reducing our variable cost structure, reducing discretionary spending among many other efforts. In short, we believe the steps that we have implemented enhance the company's financial flexibility as we navigate these unprecedented times. In addition, we are also appreciative of the administration's recognition of the burden this pandemic is having on the nation's healthcare system and the passage of the Cares Act that will help provide some relief to healthcare providers. We anticipate that HCA will receive approximately $4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments provided by the Cares Act, and have already received sustainably all of these funds in the month of April. Stipulated in the act for our hospitals, these monies will be repaid over an eight month time period beginning in August of 2020. During April, we have also received approximately $700 million of funds distributed from the first phase of the public health and social services emergency fund. We are working through providing the necessary at the stations that are part of the distribution process. We understand there are plenty future distributions from this fund, but do not know what future funds, if any, we might receive at this point. The Cares Act also provided deferral of the employer portion of social security payroll taxes, which we estimate to be approximately $75 million a month starting in April of 2020. These deferred amounts will has to be paid in late '21 and '22. And there were certain other aspects of the Cares Act that we believe will provide benefit to the company in the future.  In our planning for potential impacts to the company, we are running different scenarios around major variables, such as payer mix, volume rebound and cost reductions with different durations. Given this is an ongoing and unprecedented public health event there are just too many unknowns to provide any specific estimates of the impact at this time. While it is still early in the process, what we have identified is a cascading range of additional management actions available to take depending on how the business returns. We have already implemented our stage one actions, and we are implementing aspects of our second stages as we begin the restart process. We have a third stage action plan available to execute, if we believe there's a long-term structural change to our revenue. Ultimately, we are confident in HCA's ability to manage through these phases, however they may unfold. So before I turn the call over to Mark, let me close by saying we believe the strength, scale and resiliency of HCA, are longstanding and critical attributes that will serve us well during this time. And it is important to know that our focus remains on the guiding principles that Sam outlined in his comments, including focusing on the safety and welfare of our employees and physicians, providing high quality care to our patients and appropriately managing the financial aspect of the company as we manage through this difficult period of time. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark to open it up for Q&A.\nMark Kimbrough: Well, thanks Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so that we might give as many as possible in the queue an opportunity to ask questions this morning. Marcella, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask questions. Marcella?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Sandler.\nSarah James: Can you help us better understand what the return to rebooking looks like? So do you have different procedures in place for various geographies as they may not all be affected equally? And how should we think about what that looks like overall across your portfolio?\nSam Hazen: Let me give you a sense of what we're seeing and what we're calling a reboot that's our term. And obviously we have each day implementing different policy decisions about social distancing, elective care when certain businesses start and so forth that's the first point. The second point I would add is that we are working with our physicians to understand their needs as they reboot also. We've got a task force with surgeons and others on our team developing a work stream to assist them. So once we get a better sense of their backlog, a better sense of what's allowed from local government and state government, we\u2019ll be able to start a scheduling process and ensure that we have the resources necessary to address their needs. We also have a work stream around our patients and making sure that we can reassure them that we have a safe environment. We've implemented universal precautions. We've implemented advanced lab testing. We've stepped up our PPE controls and patient cohorting processes. So again we can reassure them. And then finally I think it's about how we bring on capacity. We won't immediately reopen with the existing capacity that we had in the middle of May. So we're determining ways to reopen our capacity very efficiently. We think this will result in some early consolidation of existing operations until we get to the next phase. As I've said in my comments, we're hopeful that the reboot process will be accomplished across all of our markets by the end of the second quarter, but that\u2019s still to be determined based upon some of these other hurdles that have to be cleared.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead, Pito Chickering. We\u2019ll move to the next question. We\u2019ve got Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoshua Raskin: Good morning. And obviously big thank you to the entire organization and especially the clinical staff at HCA. Question just on cash flow initiatives, and appreciate the comments that both Sam and Bill made. But what are you asking payers to do? And if you look at sort of April as a proxy for what life looks like under the current environment. Sort of how do you think about cash flow needs, and how long does this last until you have to do something external? And again to sort of keeping -- using April as kind of your base?\nBill Rutherford: Well, first as Sam mentioned, we think partnerships was a good, was an important guiding principle for us. And we've been in active discussion with our payers, and we are very pleased with their support during this process. And I think our normal kind of AR process is continuing on there. So we're thankful for their efforts on that. Relative to cash flow, I don't know if April is a proxy. As we've said, we think the second quarter will be probably the most pronounced quarter and then hopefully we will begin to see some recovery throughout the quarter. I think the steps that the company has taken and I mentioned regarding liquidity, position the company very well not only from where we finish the first quarter. But you look at the additional actions that we've taken with the share repurchase program, adjustments to our capital spending. And then as I mentioned with the administration support to the Cares Act, our cash position is very strong from where we sit right now. So, we believe we're in a very strong position from a liquidity standpoint and our focus has really been working through providing the necessary response during this timeframe.\nSam Hazen: Let me add to that Bill, if I may. This is Sam. I would like to acknowledge a number of the payers. In particular, I'd like to acknowledge United Health Group. I think they took a very significant leadership position in relaxing some of their claims edits and so forth and sped up payables in a very significant way, for our company as well as for the whole industry. Also other components of the health insurance industry, I think relaxed aspects of their pre-authorizations and other type of controls to allow for a smoother process in a more efficient turnover of payables on their side as well. And that helped I think the industry as a whole. It helped us as well and we will continue to work with them, I think in a very collaborative way to address issues that we have as well as issues that they have.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi.\nRalph Giacobbe: Just hoping to understand a little more, when you say restart in the back half of 2Q. Sounds like that just mean kind of states opening up and allowing elective procedures back. I don't know if there's any more sort of details you can provide on that. And then when you say recovery in the summer. Can you just give us a little bit of a sense of what that means? Is that just, you'll be sort of fully go to sort of see patients, or should we think of it as we're 60%, 70%, 80% sort of there in terms of volume that's been lost, any willingness to give detail there\u2019d be helpful? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: I don't think we're in a position to give you any kind of percentages at this particular point. When we defined the first phase as the reboot that's basically getting over the hurdles that our state requirements getting over some of the backlog, if you will, on the elective cases that have been postponed and helping our physicians and others get back in business, that's what we mean by the reboot. The recovery period is really difficult to determine at this point. We don't know what the full effect and the damage to the economy are going to be. We don't understand clearly what the uninsured levels are going to be. So we anticipate the effects to vary by market. We also believe that there will be major areas that influence our business results. As we've talked about, we think patient confidence is very important and it's incumbent upon all health systems to create that reassurance that patients can come to a health system as they did just two months ago with confidence and that their safety can be protected. So we have universal precautions, as I mentioned, patient cohorting sufficient PPE, different lab testing capabilities to support this effort. We've also got to manage through the possibility of COVID-19 recurrence, so we're maintaining our surge capacity. So all of this converges on trying to understand a recovery process, and we don't feel like we can predict that at this particular point in time. Some of that is going to be determined about the factors way outside of our control, whether or not there's antiviral therapies that work, or a vaccine that's developed at a timeline that's more current than what's out there today. So all of this is part of what we're calling the recovery phase. So as we get some visibility into the variables associated with that, we can make adjustments in a more informed manner, and that's how we're thinking about it. So we're not in a position at all to estimate percentages or timeline. So that's why we had to pull our guidance, that's why we took some of these other capital preservation tactics to ensure that we have the flexibility to make those adjustments in an inappropriate way.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel.\nScott Fidel: I had a question just on one of the specific reimbursement provisions in the cares funding, which was the 20% bump to the Medicare DRGs for COVID related treatments. And just interested in terms of how you're seeing in terms of discussions, or already in terms of actions that flowing through towards increased reimbursement that are tied to DRGs or not across the other payer classes. So specifically, thinking about is MA plans, commercial plan and then also if Medicaid is doing anything similarly in terms of what they are evaluating on improving the reimbursement rates tied to COVID related treatments? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Scott, this is Bill. Let me try and answer that. One, we are appreciative of that 20% add-on for COVID patients as part of the Cares Act. I don't think in a net-net of all the things we're experienced and that will be that material. I think the most significant part of the Care Acts are the items that are mentioned regarding the accelerated Medicare payments, as well as distributions from the fond and there's other aspects of that that I think will be beneficial for us. So, we are appreciative of that 20% add-on. I can't tell you we've actually seen it yet, but I fully expect it will play out in our claims as we adjudicate it. I think the MA plans will adopt similar reimbursement programs that the federal government does. I do not know about Medicaid programs that yet, we can follow-up on that. But given the COVID activity that we've seen in that amount, I don't view that being that material. I think the most significant things going on with the Cares Act are things that we've been in discussion with the policymakers about understanding just the overall impact to the healthcare system and the additional costs that healthcare providers are experiencing in their preparation, and then just this potential movement with uninsured patients. So that's where our focus has been. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Just want to follow-up maybe on that one a little bit. Can you quantify the other provisions? So the $700 million was good. But I guess the DSH and the sequestration impact? And then as far as that $700 million goes. How and when would you expect to be able to kind of book that? Is that show up as revenue and is it show up in Q2, or does that have to phase in as the year progresses?\nBill Rutherford: So I think the [$7 million] once we go through our processes will show up in revenue in Q2, and we\u2019ll see what other fund distributions may occur. Regarding the other aspects, obviously I mentioned the two significant. The sequestration aspect, we believe will be approximately $100 million for us between the balance of the year at historical Medicare volumes. So that number would be adjusted with our Medicare volumes be in a little shorter than where they historically been. The DSH was really just a continued deferral, which we had already in our plans anticipated that would be deferral. So I think the sequestration, the fund distributions and the accelerated Medicare payments, would be the most significant things we call out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nFrank Morgan: I think you got some news yesterday a number of states that are important to you like Texas and Tennessee were some of the first states that are likely to reopen. So I'm curious what your conversations again like with the state agencies in those states. And then separately, I'd be real curious of the physicians and the surgeons that you talk to. What is their thought process right now in terms of the start back? Are they anxious to go, or are they still hesitant? Any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.\nSam Hazen: I think the health system industry in Tennessee, Texas, Florida, Colorado, all these different states is connected to the government's office. If you think about social distancing and the objective around social distancing, it was to prevent and overrun of the healthcare system. While many of our markets, the initial forecast were to sobering to be honest with you and they have come in significantly less. And so we have ample capacity and we've learned a lot over this past five or six weeks, and that's what we shared with the different governor's offices and local officials' offices is that there has been significant learnings already that have come from this particular experience. There has been increases in lab testing capacity. There has been improvement in PPE supply chain inventory levels. And there is a better understanding by our teams and our physicians on how to manage COVID-19 patients. So all of that is going to serve us well we believe and serve our communities well down the road as we battle this particular event. With respect to our physicians, it's mixed as you would expect. Many of our physicians are eager to go and want to address their backlog. Others still have questions around patient safety, their own personal safety and how all of that is going to be managed. Again, we have a very specific work stream of multidisciplinary team that includes surgeons on there to ensure that we have the right procedures in place to deal generally with the issues that we have. But we're excited about the reopening in Texas. We're excited about Tennessee and we anticipate other states starting to relax some of these procedures and policies just as we mentioned over the course of the next few weeks, allowing us to start back on some of the care that's needed in the community. So we'll just have to wait and see how all that ramps up again. It's variable and we'll just have to process it Frank and hopefully, have it behind us at the end of the second quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from UBS.\nWhit Mayo: Sam, can you maybe just go back and elaborate a little bit more on the comments you made around structural changes? Any thoughts on how you're thinking about it? I know it's really a big multi-dimensional topic? And then if you could comment on the aspects of the Cares Act that you said might provide long-term benefits, Bill. Just curious what you're referencing? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: I'll let Bill answer the question on the Cares Act. When we think about structure, we're thinking about the demand side of the equation and the supply side of the equation. And on the demand side, we're trying to judge fundamentally has there been a demand curve shift as a result of the COVID-19. By that, we mean have income levels drop because of unemployment and uninsured that starts to influence buying patterns and healthcare services demand. Do patient preferences, with respect to concerns about COVID-19 cause patients to avoid the health system? Has telemedicine structurally changed certain buying patterns? We don't have a sense of that yet, but those are variables that we're trying to understand. On the supply side, we're trying to understand what happens with certain providers. Will we actually exit the marketplace and start to again think about a shift in the supply curve? Will physician changes occur and create changes to the supply side of the equation? There could be government regulations that create implications also on the supply side. Many of these we think create opportunities for HCA as we move forward. And so those are the big structural variables with that we're trying to study, stay close to, have responses in our different phases of our plans, allowing us to respond appropriately and capitalized as well on opportunities as they develop.\nBill Rutherford: On the Cares Act, if I said long-term, I didn't mean long-term. I think we view the Cares Act activity that we've seen really being more immediate term. Clearly, through the accelerated payment program we received that was in a short-term item to recognize the impact to the industry. And we know those funds have to be repaid starting in August over an eight month period of time. I think the distributions from the public health fund is a great for start and is recognition of the impact on there. So we see most of the Cares Act activity being much more of an immediate term impact to recognize the disruption that's going on with healthcare providers across the country.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Just one clarification to your answer to Whit, there's been some talk about switching from in patient outpatient more as a result of all this or outpatient into ASCs. I'm wondering about your comment there? And then also on your cost reduction program, it sounds like the first two pages are well in hand and then the third one is sort of on hold if things continue at a tough pace. Is there any way to quantify at all how much order of magnitude on the savings that you're trying to get in those programs?\nSam Hazen: Let me answer the first question, I\u2019ll let Bill answer the second question, A.J. We do have substitute settings as a variable on the demand side that we're studying. Does that mean our women's hospitals are across the organization are better positioned than commingled women's services we have across many of HCA markets dedicated women's hospitals that are separately controlled, if you will and does that create advantage for us in obstetric services? Possibly. Will we see more activity in ambulatory surgery centers? Again, that's a possibility. But it's incumbent upon us in our hospitals to create the same kind of safe circumstances, safe environment for outpatient surgical patients, outpatient cardiology patients and so forth. But substitute settings are something that we are studying, and we are thinking about as we go through this transition. And obviously, we believe we're already well prepared to respond to those. And again, it may create opportunities down the road, but there are levels of risk as well. So we have to balance all of that out. But we think again HCA's diversification of services, diversification of facilities, diversification of markets give us opportunities to navigate through that transition better than most.\nBill Rutherford: On the cost side, I think it's too early to try to quantify the impact of all of these. Clearly, we identified some of the stage one actions, which is really more focused around some of our immediate discretionary spending in our stage two that we're in. Now as we begin to reboot process basically goes deeper into our cost structure, mostly around discretionary spend giving our commitment to our employees. And then you look at the stage three, which we really aren't implementing yet but we'll be prepared to if the circumstances require. We really get more into some of the changes to our fixed cost structure and going deeper into our cost side. But all of that and we'll pay some will be dependent on how we see the volume returning as we go through these different phases.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: I guess the question is for either Sam or Bill. You guys have both been at the company through the past couple of recessions. So as we think about, you just mentioned diversification. How are you thinking about the ability of HCA to deliver growth as you had in past market pullbacks? And also more specifically, there's a lot of fear right now about Texas, Houston's a 10% margin for you guys. What do you see there or how are you thinking about the oil industry\u2019s impact on your business?\nSam Hazen: Well, obviously this crisis is not a parallel necessarily to any other recession that we've been through. It's got public health connected to it as well as economy. And the third variable, as you just mentioned, is energy. So we have three pressure points, if you will, that we're trying to sort out. I don't know that we have a read on the energy implications for Texas at this particular point in time. Again, Texas is more diversified today than it's ever been. Obviously, energy in that particular industry plays a huge part in the economy but not as much as it did 10 years ago and clearly not as much as it did 20 years ago. For us, we have 43 markets in the U. S. Texas is clearly significant and we will continue to pay attention to those detail. But across the portfolios, one market in Huston is less than 10% of the company and won't necessarily fully influence the company's results. But those are difficult for us to ascertain at this point in time and we really don't have any visibility into it and cannot speak to the implications just yet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Good morning, guys. I would like to add my thanks to HCA's leadership and its clinicians out there in the real world managing through this earnings and EBITDA side. I think the U.S. is really fortunate to have companies like yours for sure, so we really appreciate you. At this point, I just have a couple of items for Bill, just to clarify. On the $4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments for April, I presume that's a cash flow only item not a P&L item. And then on the $75 million a month of FICA tax deferrals. Is that also cash flow only since you ultimately have to pay, will you still be accruing that in that as we see you buying, or is it EBITDA benefit for 2020?\nBill Rutherford: Gary, first thanks for your comments. And yes, you're correct on both of those. They're cash flow items only. There will be no P&L impact of the accelerated Medicare payments or the deferral of the FICA taxes. We will continue to accrue the expenses associated with the employer sponsor FICA taxes or P&L, it just the payment gets deferred and the accelerated payments will just go on the balance sheet until we go through the repayment cycles.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette: Good morning everyone. And let me also commend you and all the work that you do on the pandemic. So couple of questions here, just on the first wave of $30 billion in industry leading data, once we get beyond that. When we think about remaining $70 million out of the total $100 billion from the Cares Act, I think you mentioned that the visibility and that's still not clear at the moment on timing, et cetera. But do you have any color at least on formulate that we have might be paid out. Is it still a think possibly going to be tied to the Medicare fee for service formula? I know the AHA was also talking about a per bed amount, $25,000 previously that could change. I\u2019m curious about the formula there. And the second quick follow up, which is around your payer mix comments in your prepared remarks and the potential for people to move from commercial health insurance to exchanges or Medicaid. I guess just based on the timing of that sort of change. I'm curious if that\u2019s something that might be more impactful this year in 2020, or would that be something that maybe a bigger variable for 2021 as we think about that?\nBill Rutherford: At the end of the day, we do not have the visibility into the formula of the distribution of the remaining funds. We stay connected. We have given our views of different fomulas. We understand there is a lot of constituencies that are also doing the same. So as of today, we just don't know what that formula will be. We understand there\u2019s some discussions on different metrics that will be tie to either going disproportionately to certain areas of the country and/or considering uninsured or considering some disruptions on there. We think position we've outlined is that almost every institution is impacted regardless of the number of COVID patients. So we'll just have to wait to see on that. I think on the payer mix changes, you're right, that is obviously an important variable that we are modeling. I think today is different maybe than in past eras were, because we have some states that have expanded in Medicaid and that we have subsidies available for people to purchase coverage in the health insurance exchanges. Those are two different dynamics today than were in place the last time we went through an economic cycle. So we'll have to see how that plays out. My sense is those are longer term implications, much more than they are shorter terms. Even as COBRA gets extended and as we are working with various community agencies to try to help people understand the potential coverage options in the event they find themselves unemployed for a period of time. So I do believe that will be a longer term impact, and we'll just have to wait to see how that plays out.\nSam Hazen: Steven, thank you so much. Marcella, I think we're finished with the call. Listen, I want to again thank everyone for joining us today. Those of you who are shareholders of the company on the call, I want to thank you for your support of the company. And I will be around obviously to answer additional questions that you might have. So feel free to give me a call. Have a wonderful week. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Okay, great. Thank you, Sam and good morning everyone. Let me provide some additional information. We reported our quarterly results this morning. But as Sam mentioned, the quarter really had two distinct periods to it; the pre-pandemic period, which was January 1st through March 15th; and the last half of March where we began to see the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our reported same facility admission growth of 0.6% in the quarter comprised of about 5% growth through March 15th. Then for the last half of March, we saw an approximate 20% decline in admissions as compared to the prior year period. Almost all of our key volume indicators reflected growth through March 15th, and contractions in the last half of March as compared to the prior year period. Same facility emergency room visits grew about 5% through March 15th, and declined close to 30% in the last half of March as compared to the prior year. Same facility in-patient surgeries grew about 2% through March 15th and declined about 20% in the last half of March. Hospital-based outpatient surgeries grew about 2% through March 15th and declined about 30% in the last half of the month. Generally speaking, almost all volumes statistics were adversely affected and results were comparable among the payer classes. In essence, we saw strong results across the board until the impact of COVID-19 started to materialize in the last half of March. So rather than repeating all of our typical statistics let me discuss briefly what we see as the different phases as we navigate through this event, what we are seeing in April and most importantly, the actions we've taken as a management's team to guide the company through this period. First, as we think about the pandemic broadly, we see three phases that we believe will likely unfold in the coming months and quarters; a response phase, a restart and recovery phase. We are in the first response phase that was highlighted started with our planning in the first quarter. We then see moving to the restart phase as governmental restrictions on elect to procedures are lifted, as we work with our affiliated physicians on clinical and operational protocols and hopefully, we begin to see some reduction of COVID-19 activity. We are fully focused and have begun our planning for this restart process. We have multiple work streams around securing adequate laboratory testing capabilities, securing additional personal protective equipment, developing and providing surgical support and other important areas. Our focus is to be ready and have the capability to service the needs of our communities as quickly, confidently and safely as possible. We are preparing and will be ready to serve many of the procedures that have been deferred or cancelled.  While much depends on the easing of social and government restrictions, we believe this restart phase will begin towards the last half of the second quarter. After the restart phase, we believe we'll move into a recovery phase. Our base assumption has us occurring sometime during the summer. There will be many factors that influence how long this phase will last and what the impact will be to our operating results, but we are preparing for a range of scenarios with varying durations of the recovery period. We believe the extent of the COVID-19's impact on the company will depend on many factors. And we cannot predict the future implications this pandemic will have on our business trends at this time. As a result and highlight in our release, we are withdrawing our guidance for 2020. We do believe the impact to the company will be most pronounced during this current response phase as we continue to see volume declines in April. Thus far through April, our in-patient admissions are running about 30% below the prior year. Our emergency room visits are running about 50% below prior year as our in-patient surgeries. Our hospital based outpatient surgeries are running about 70% below our prior year as most elective procedures have been deferred. We have started to see these volume declines stabilize over the past week. We believe we will begin to see some recovery of these volumes as different regions of the country begin to open up during the second half of the quarter. So before I talk about some of our future planning, let me highlight some of the actions and precautionary measures we have already taken to strengthen the company's financial flexibility. First, due to our early planning, we entered into $2 billion short-term credit facility to provide the company with additional liquidity. As of March 31st, we had $3.8 billion of liquidity available under our credit facilities. In addition, we took a series of other actions to strengthen the company's financial position. We suspended our share repurchase program on March 13th. We also began to reduce the company's planned capital expenditures. And at this point, anticipate reducing our capital spending anywhere from $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the remaining part of 2020. We expect this will be accomplished from deferring new project starts, reducing some technology capital spending, as well as reducing some retained capital expenditures. Out of an abundance of caution, we also announced this morning the suspension of our dividend program. We expect to evaluate resumption of the dividend program at a future date. Our operating teams have also implemented a series of cost management strategies, including hiring and travel freezes, reducing our variable cost structure, reducing discretionary spending among many other efforts. In short, we believe the steps that we have implemented enhance the company's financial flexibility as we navigate these unprecedented times. In addition, we are also appreciative of the administration's recognition of the burden this pandemic is having on the nation's healthcare system and the passage of the Cares Act that will help provide some relief to healthcare providers. We anticipate that HCA will receive approximately $4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments provided by the Cares Act, and have already received sustainably all of these funds in the month of April. Stipulated in the act for our hospitals, these monies will be repaid over an eight month time period beginning in August of 2020. During April, we have also received approximately $700 million of funds distributed from the first phase of the public health and social services emergency fund. We are working through providing the necessary at the stations that are part of the distribution process. We understand there are plenty future distributions from this fund, but do not know what future funds, if any, we might receive at this point. The Cares Act also provided deferral of the employer portion of social security payroll taxes, which we estimate to be approximately $75 million a month starting in April of 2020. These deferred amounts will has to be paid in late '21 and '22. And there were certain other aspects of the Cares Act that we believe will provide benefit to the company in the future.  In our planning for potential impacts to the company, we are running different scenarios around major variables, such as payer mix, volume rebound and cost reductions with different durations. Given this is an ongoing and unprecedented public health event there are just too many unknowns to provide any specific estimates of the impact at this time. While it is still early in the process, what we have identified is a cascading range of additional management actions available to take depending on how the business returns. We have already implemented our stage one actions, and we are implementing aspects of our second stages as we begin the restart process. We have a third stage action plan available to execute, if we believe there's a long-term structural change to our revenue. Ultimately, we are confident in HCA's ability to manage through these phases, however they may unfold. So before I turn the call over to Mark, let me close by saying we believe the strength, scale and resiliency of HCA, are longstanding and critical attributes that will serve us well during this time. And it is important to know that our focus remains on the guiding principles that Sam outlined in his comments, including focusing on the safety and welfare of our employees and physicians, providing high quality care to our patients and appropriately managing the financial aspect of the company as we manage through this difficult period of time. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark to open it up for Q&A. Well, first as Sam mentioned, we think partnerships was a good, was an important guiding principle for us. And we've been in active discussion with our payers, and we are very pleased with their support during this process. And I think our normal kind of AR process is continuing on there. So we're thankful for their efforts on that. Relative to cash flow, I don't know if April is a proxy. As we've said, we think the second quarter will be probably the most pronounced quarter and then hopefully we will begin to see some recovery throughout the quarter. I think the steps that the company has taken and I mentioned regarding liquidity, position the company very well not only from where we finish the first quarter. But you look at the additional actions that we've taken with the share repurchase program, adjustments to our capital spending. And then as I mentioned with the administration support to the Cares Act, our cash position is very strong from where we sit right now. So, we believe we're in a very strong position from a liquidity standpoint and our focus has really been working through providing the necessary response during this timeframe. Scott, this is Bill. Let me try and answer that. One, we are appreciative of that 20% add-on for COVID patients as part of the Cares Act. I don't think in a net-net of all the things we're experienced and that will be that material. I think the most significant part of the Care Acts are the items that are mentioned regarding the accelerated Medicare payments, as well as distributions from the fond and there's other aspects of that that I think will be beneficial for us. So, we are appreciative of that 20% add-on. I can't tell you we've actually seen it yet, but I fully expect it will play out in our claims as we adjudicate it. I think the MA plans will adopt similar reimbursement programs that the federal government does. I do not know about Medicaid programs that yet, we can follow-up on that. But given the COVID activity that we've seen in that amount, I don't view that being that material. I think the most significant things going on with the Cares Act are things that we've been in discussion with the policymakers about understanding just the overall impact to the healthcare system and the additional costs that healthcare providers are experiencing in their preparation, and then just this potential movement with uninsured patients. So that's where our focus has been. So I think the [$7 million] once we go through our processes will show up in revenue in Q2, and we'll see what other fund distributions may occur. Regarding the other aspects, obviously I mentioned the two significant. The sequestration aspect, we believe will be approximately $100 million for us between the balance of the year at historical Medicare volumes. So that number would be adjusted with our Medicare volumes be in a little shorter than where they historically been. The DSH was really just a continued deferral, which we had already in our plans anticipated that would be deferral. So I think the sequestration, the fund distributions and the accelerated Medicare payments, would be the most significant things we call out. On the Cares Act, if I said long-term, I didn't mean long-term. I think we view the Cares Act activity that we've seen really being more immediate term. Clearly, through the accelerated payment program we received that was in a short-term item to recognize the impact to the industry. And we know those funds have to be repaid starting in August over an eight month period of time. I think the distributions from the public health fund is a great for start and is recognition of the impact on there. So we see most of the Cares Act activity being much more of an immediate term impact to recognize the disruption that's going on with healthcare providers across the country. On the cost side, I think it's too early to try to quantify the impact of all of these. Clearly, we identified some of the stage one actions, which is really more focused around some of our immediate discretionary spending in our stage two that we're in. Now as we begin to reboot process basically goes deeper into our cost structure, mostly around discretionary spend giving our commitment to our employees. And then you look at the stage three, which we really aren't implementing yet but we'll be prepared to if the circumstances require. We really get more into some of the changes to our fixed cost structure and going deeper into our cost side. But all of that and we'll pay some will be dependent on how we see the volume returning as we go through these different phases. Gary, first thanks for your comments. And yes, you're correct on both of those. They're cash flow items only. There will be no P&L impact of the accelerated Medicare payments or the deferral of the FICA taxes. We will continue to accrue the expenses associated with the employer sponsor FICA taxes or P&L, it just the payment gets deferred and the accelerated payments will just go on the balance sheet until we go through the repayment cycles. At the end of the day, we do not have the visibility into the formula of the distribution of the remaining funds. We stay connected. We have given our views of different fomulas. We understand there is a lot of constituencies that are also doing the same. So as of today, we just don't know what that formula will be. We understand there's some discussions on different metrics that will be tie to either going disproportionately to certain areas of the country and/or considering uninsured or considering some disruptions on there. We think position we've outlined is that almost every institution is impacted regardless of the number of COVID patients. So we'll just have to wait to see on that.

So I do believe that will be a longer term impact, and we'll just have to wait to see how that plays out."

            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining the call. I will focus my comments this morning on the COVID-19 pandemic and direct you to our earnings release for the financial results for the first quarter. In general, the first 80% of the quarter was very similar to the growth we have experienced over the past two years, and was a reflection of the momentum we had heading into the year. Then the effects of the pandemic begin to hit us in mid-March. We will answer any questions you have about the first quarter's results following our comments. The early planning and preparations we did for COVID-19 involved updating clinical policies and operational guidance, preparing supply chain with added inventory levels for key personal protective equipment, drugs and ventilator equipment. It also included building approaches to add capacity for potential surge in patient volumes, leveraging data, initiating our emergency operations center and refining our management structure to execute. Like most things in our company, the basic approach was to find ways to maximize unique enterprise capability, leverage financial resources and further develop corporate relationships with other to support our hospitals. HCA Healthcare has a storied history of responding well to disasters, such as natural disasters like hurricanes and floods, as well as mass casualty events like the concert shooting in Las Vegas. We used these past experiences to guide and inform the planning and response during the crisis, which was the first one we would face at enterprise scale. This event has required us to respond differently with a structure that included a more balanced approach between corporate support, division coordination and facility execution. As part of our plan, we developed five guiding principles that established a framework for decision making and actions through the crisis. These principles are simple yet extremely powerful and they endure today. They are as follows; first, protect our employees and physicians; second, be there for patients; third, partner with others; next, be a resource for communities and government; and last, accelerate the company through the crisis. We started this effort and we still remain focused on protecting the safety and health of our employees and physicians as the first principle. We enhanced training, established better PPE acquisition, distribution and control systems, implemented a universal masking policy and improved lab testing turnaround time as part of this endeavor. We have cared for approximately 5,500 positive COVID-19 in-patients so far across the company. We were early to implement universal masking of care providers and to-date we have had limited exposures to employees and doctors. A strong corporate culture is the bedrock of HCA Healthcare. This event has reinforced its importance and provided us with an opportunity to see it in action every day. Our dedicated and caring employees are the lifeblood of the company. To-date, we have not laid off or furloughed one employee as a result of the pandemic. Instead, we adopted a pandemic pay program that supports approximately 80,000 employees who are not getting their normal hours as a result of reduced overall volume. Almost 11,000 corporate and division colleagues graciously took a salary cut of 10% to 30% for April and May, depending upon their compensation level as a show of solidarity for our caregivers in the hospital. Additionally, over 90% of our support staffs are working productively from home. This remote work model has provided insight into operational efficiencies for the future and is about one example of organizational learning from this event. To further support our colleagues, many within the organization have contributed to the HCA hope fund, which is a 501(c)3 charity that is exclusively focused on providing support to fellow colleagues when they experience hardships in their lives. In less than one month, the fund has received unprecedented levels of contribution from employees, board members and the Frist Foundation, a true testament to our culture, mission and value. Already, the whole front has over $1.3 million in grant applications that have either been paid or pending approval from more than 1200 employees. It is times like these that test whether we honor our mission or not. We choose to honor it. For Affiliated Physicians, we have implemented a COVID-19 response model that includes partnering with other technical experts to assist them with navigating the Cares Act and accessing certain benefits available to them. Also, HCA Healthcare is a large medical office landlord and we took a leadership position and many of our third-party developers have followed in implementing a rent deferral program, which addresses medical practice or business disruption and maintains availability of medical care and related services for patients and the community. This program, which is allowed through federal waivers, provides relief for our tenants over the next few months. We have also provided similar relief to physician partners and our ambulatory surgery centers. We have great relationships with our physicians and we wanted to help them through this difficult period. The second guiding principle was to be there for our patients and we have been. Our employees have shown up, our physicians have shown up, they have been on the front line and they have not wavered during this pandemic crisis in meeting their responsibilities of placing patients first. We've had ample capacity across our system to serve community needs. We have used the logistical capability of our supply chain to move supplies and ventilator equipment to needed hospitals. We have increased significantly telemedicine capabilities, the key patients in touch with their physicians. We have numerous research projects underway with our Sarah Cannon Research Institute as we continue to find ways to improve critical care medicine protocols for COVID-19 patients, lab testing methods, drug therapies and much more. And lastly, we have used our internal supplemental staffing organization to enhance personnel need when and where necessary across the enterprise. HCA Healthcare is a nation of heroes. I want to thank our colleagues and physicians for their unwavering commitment to patients, their tremendous sacrifice and hard work and their remarkable teamwork and dedication to each other. I salute them and I know their community salutes them as well. The third principle was to partner with others and forge new relationships. We have evolved existing relationships with other companies in the industry to collaborate and solve problems. We have developed new relationships that allowed us to accelerate protocols for in-patient COVID-19 testing that have become the norm for many health systems. We have partnered with a technology company to advance monitoring of community resources and illnesses. We believe these relationships and others will benefit us in the future as we see many opportunities for further enhancing our shared commitment and creating more value for patients and the communities we serve. I want to thank the leadership of these organizations for their collaboration and commitment to support our hospitals. The fourth guiding principle was to be a resource for the community and for government, both local and federal .we have collaborated with local health systems, health agencies, first responders and many more. Our teams are working directly with FEMA, CDC and recently we took a leadership position in developing with the federal government and the American Hospital Association a dynamic ventilator response network that will utilize excess inventories across the country to support needs in COVID-19 hotspots as they arise. We believe these types of public private sector partnerships are necessary and valuable in responding to a public health emergency of this type and in creating channels of understanding between sectors. And the last guiding principle was to accelerate HCA Healthcare through this crisis and position the company for success in the future. This principle means that we are focused on using this pandemic to learn more and to learn faster. It demonstrates also our capacity for improving and becoming more agile at planning, executing, communicating and processing solutions more effectively. And finally, this principle means that we as a company take steps to navigate appropriately through this difficult and uncertain period for the benefit of all stakeholders. We view our networks as part of and fundamental to community infrastructure. Across the 43 communities we serve, our local health systems have a sacred responsibility to always be there when needed. To meet this promise, we must take prudent and necessary actions. As part of our planning, we took a number of steps, which we believe are appropriate to protect the company and be there for the people we serve. The culture of HCA Healthcare is laser focused on the patient. Our strategy, our decisions and our resource allocation revolve around that. We also have a strong track record when it comes to making decisions that benefit our shareholders. The philosophy we have with respect to shareholder value remains. We continue to believe that a capital allocation strategy of reinvesting in our business and repurchasing stock will generate long-term value for the company. These strategies in the past dividends have benefited our shareholders. But given the uncertainty around this unprecedented pandemic, we felt it's prudent to adjust the company's current capital allocation strategy. First, we reduced capital spending by delaying certain projects and postponing various initiatives. Second, we suspended share buybacks under existing programs. And third, out an abundance of caution, we suspended the dividend. We will continue to review the capital allocation strategy as we always do and plan to determine the appropriate adjustments as we get better visibility into our business. As we look ahead to the next phases of this pandemic, which starts with the reboot of core operations, we have developed various scenarios to inform the ranges of management actions necessary to respond appropriately to them. These scenarios are built around three major variables. First, understanding the impact of the recently unemployed on payer mix is important, including how many people, either maintain existing employer sponsored insurance coverage through COBRA programs, move to coverage from products sold in the exchanges, enroll in Medicaid or become uninsured. Obviously, the timing of the economic recovery and government programs support will determine the outcome of this variable. The second variable relates to the rebound in volume. As directed by federal and state governments, we have suspended certain operations, especially elective business, which is mostly surgical and generally more profitable than medical business. Additionally, emergency room visits have declined significantly during this event, because of general concerns with COVID-19 and sheltering at home policies. Our modeling includes different levels and different timelines for their rebound. We are focused on a reboot plan that places us in the best possible position for success in resuming suspended operations. The reboot will require us to work with the governors on social distancing policies, which we believe will vary by market. We have to understand what physicians need to restart their practices. And finally, we have to respond to patients in a way that reassures them that we have the safe and protected care environment they deserve. We expect to bring on capacity in a conservative manner as markets allow and in the most efficient way possible during the reboot. At this point, we believe the reboot phase will be accomplished across most of the company by the end of the second quarter. The third variable is our cost reduction plan. We have developed three stages of cost reductions with each one being more significant should there be a longer time to recovery. We have already executed on most of the first stage items and now we are implementing aspects of the second stage as we look to enter the reboot phase. The third stage of our plan includes a response to a situation where we see structural changes to revenue. We will be vigilant about determining if this happens. But at this point, we believe it is too early to implement the measures in this third stage. We have demonstrated over the years the ability to respond and adjust operations to various conditions. I have faith in our team and believe that they will once again prove it in the face of this ongoing challenge. As I've said many times in the past, I believe HCA Healthcare is incredibly resilient, because of our dedicated people, the scale we have and the ability to leverage it uniquely to capitalize on business opportunities or address challenges. We believe our resiliency is further enhanced by our diversification of markets, diversification of services and a strong asset base, which can provide a certain level of strategic optionality and flexibility. We have seen it demonstrated over our 50 plus year existence, and I believe we will see it again. In closing, I say with confidence that we will get back to normal in time but we realize it maybe a new normal. Fortunately, I see HCA Healthcare as uniquely positioned to help define the new normal and capitalize on new opportunities. I want to thank our shareholders again for their support of HCA Healthcare. And now, I will turn the call over to Bill for a few more comments. Let me give you a sense of what we're seeing and what we're calling a reboot that's our term. And obviously we have each day implementing different policy decisions about social distancing, elective care when certain businesses start and so forth that's the first point. The second point I would add is that we are working with our physicians to understand their needs as they reboot also. We've got a task force with surgeons and others on our team developing a work stream to assist them. So once we get a better sense of their backlog, a better sense of what's allowed from local government and state government, we'll be able to start a scheduling process and ensure that we have the resources necessary to address their needs. We also have a work stream around our patients and making sure that we can reassure them that we have a safe environment. We've implemented universal precautions. We've implemented advanced lab testing. We've stepped up our PPE controls and patient cohorting processes. So again we can reassure them. And then finally I think it's about how we bring on capacity. We won't immediately reopen with the existing capacity that we had in the middle of May. So we're determining ways to reopen our capacity very efficiently. We think this will result in some early consolidation of existing operations until we get to the next phase. As I've said in my comments, we're hopeful that the reboot process will be accomplished across all of our markets by the end of the second quarter, but that's still to be determined based upon some of these other hurdles that have to be cleared. Let me add to that Bill, if I may. This is Sam. I would like to acknowledge a number of the payers. In particular, I'd like to acknowledge United Health Group. I think they took a very significant leadership position in relaxing some of their claims edits and so forth and sped up payables in a very significant way, for our company as well as for the whole industry. Also other components of the health insurance industry, I think relaxed aspects of their pre-authorizations and other type of controls to allow for a smoother process in a more efficient turnover of payables on their side as well. And that helped I think the industry as a whole. It helped us as well and we will continue to work with them, I think in a very collaborative way to address issues that we have as well as issues that they have. I don't think we're in a position to give you any kind of percentages at this particular point. When we defined the first phase as the reboot that's basically getting over the hurdles that our state requirements getting over some of the backlog, if you will, on the elective cases that have been postponed and helping our physicians and others get back in business, that's what we mean by the reboot. The recovery period is really difficult to determine at this point. We don't know what the full effect and the damage to the economy are going to be. We don't understand clearly what the uninsured levels are going to be. So we anticipate the effects to vary by market. We also believe that there will be major areas that influence our business results. As we've talked about, we think patient confidence is very important and it's incumbent upon all health systems to create that reassurance that patients can come to a health system as they did just two months ago with confidence and that their safety can be protected. So we have universal precautions, as I mentioned, patient cohorting sufficient PPE, different lab testing capabilities to support this effort. We've also got to manage through the possibility of COVID-19 recurrence, so we're maintaining our surge capacity. So all of this converges on trying to understand a recovery process, and we don't feel like we can predict that at this particular point in time. Some of that is going to be determined about the factors way outside of our control, whether or not there's antiviral therapies that work, or a vaccine that's developed at a timeline that's more current than what's out there today. So all of this is part of what we're calling the recovery phase. So as we get some visibility into the variables associated with that, we can make adjustments in a more informed manner, and that's how we're thinking about it. So we're not in a position at all to estimate percentages or timeline. So that's why we had to pull our guidance, that's why we took some of these other capital preservation tactics to ensure that we have the flexibility to make those adjustments in an inappropriate way. I think the health system industry in Tennessee, Texas, Florida, Colorado, all these different states is connected to the government's office. If you think about social distancing and the objective around social distancing, it was to prevent and overrun of the healthcare system. While many of our markets, the initial forecast were to sobering to be honest with you and they have come in significantly less. And so we have ample capacity and we've learned a lot over this past five or six weeks, and that's what we shared with the different governor's offices and local officials' offices is that there has been significant learnings already that have come from this particular experience. There has been increases in lab testing capacity. There has been improvement in PPE supply chain inventory levels. And there is a better understanding by our teams and our physicians on how to manage COVID-19 patients. So all of that is going to serve us well we believe and serve our communities well down the road as we battle this particular event. With respect to our physicians, it's mixed as you would expect. Many of our physicians are eager to go and want to address their backlog. Others still have questions around patient safety, their own personal safety and how all of that is going to be managed. Again, we have a very specific work stream of multidisciplinary team that includes surgeons on there to ensure that we have the right procedures in place to deal generally with the issues that we have. But we're excited about the reopening in Texas. We're excited about Tennessee and we anticipate other states starting to relax some of these procedures and policies just as we mentioned over the course of the next few weeks, allowing us to start back on some of the care that's needed in the community. So we'll just have to wait and see how all that ramps up again. It's variable and we'll just have to process it Frank and hopefully, have it behind us at the end of the second quarter. I'll let Bill answer the question on the Cares Act. When we think about structure, we're thinking about the demand side of the equation and the supply side of the equation. And on the demand side, we're trying to judge fundamentally has there been a demand curve shift as a result of the COVID-19. By that, we mean have income levels drop because of unemployment and uninsured that starts to influence buying patterns and healthcare services demand. Do patient preferences, with respect to concerns about COVID-19 cause patients to avoid the health system? Has telemedicine structurally changed certain buying patterns? We don't have a sense of that yet, but those are variables that we're trying to understand. On the supply side, we're trying to understand what happens with certain providers. Will we actually exit the marketplace and start to again think about a shift in the supply curve? Will physician changes occur and create changes to the supply side of the equation? There could be government regulations that create implications also on the supply side. Many of these we think create opportunities for HCA as we move forward. And so those are the big structural variables with that we're trying to study, stay close to, have responses in our different phases of our plans, allowing us to respond appropriately and capitalized as well on opportunities as they develop. Let me answer the first question, I'll let Bill answer the second question, A.J. We do have substitute settings as a variable on the demand side that we're studying. Does that mean our women's hospitals are across the organization are better positioned than commingled women's services we have across many of HCA markets dedicated women's hospitals that are separately controlled, if you will and does that create advantage for us in obstetric services? Possibly. Will we see more activity in ambulatory surgery centers? Again, that's a possibility. But it's incumbent upon us in our hospitals to create the same kind of safe circumstances, safe environment for outpatient surgical patients, outpatient cardiology patients and so forth. But substitute settings are something that we are studying, and we are thinking about as we go through this transition. And obviously, we believe we're already well prepared to respond to those. And again, it may create opportunities down the road, but there are levels of risk as well. So we have to balance all of that out. But we think again HCA's diversification of services, diversification of facilities, diversification of markets give us opportunities to navigate through that transition better than most. Well, obviously this crisis is not a parallel necessarily to any other recession that we've been through. It's got public health connected to it as well as economy. And the third variable, as you just mentioned, is energy. So we have three pressure points, if you will, that we're trying to sort out. I don't know that we have a read on the energy implications for Texas at this particular point in time. Again, Texas is more diversified today than it's ever been. Obviously, energy in that particular industry plays a huge part in the economy but not as much as it did 10 years ago and clearly not as much as it did 20 years ago. For us, we have 43 markets in the U. S. Texas is clearly significant and we will continue to pay attention to those detail. But across the portfolios, one market in Huston is less than 10% of the company and won't necessarily fully influence the company's results. But those are difficult for us to ascertain at this point in time and we really don't have any visibility into it and cannot speak to the implications just yet. Steven, thank you so much. Marcella, I think we're finished with the call. Listen, I want to again thank everyone for joining us today. Those of you who are shareholders of the company on the call, I want to thank you for your support of the company. And I will be around obviously to answer additional questions that you might have. So feel free to give me a call. Have a wonderful week. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and welcome to everybody on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford, along with our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Michael Cuffe, and Frank Morgan, our new VP of IR. Welcome, Frank.\nFrank Morgan: Pleasure here.\nMark Kimbrough: Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we'll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam and Bill, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: All right. Thank you, Mark. And good morning, and thank you for joining us. As we begin this call, I want to reflect on 2021. Across many dimensions of our business, our teams demonstrated an impressive ability to adjust quickly and effectively to three different surges and deliver for our patients, deliver for our communities and deliver for each other. This steadfast resolve and sacrifice to serve others are what make health care workers special people in general, but specifically for HCA Healthcare, they are what make our company great. I want to thank our colleagues and physicians for their outstanding work this past year. In the fourth quarter, the COVID pandemic once again altered course with the Omicron variant. As the Delta variant surge was slowing down at the end of the third quarter with some spill-over into the fourth, the Omicron surge started to influence our business in early December. Overall, our teams continued their tremendous response and the effects of the pandemic's ever changing conditions were managed well as reflected in our financial results for the fourth quarter, which were solid and in line with our most recent guidance. In the quarter, our hospitals provided care to 27,000 COVID-19 patients, approximately 5% of total admissions. This level is significantly below the third quarter's 13%. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have provided inpatient care to over 260,000 patients who contracted the virus. Currently, our hospitals continue to treat many patients with COVID-19. COVID-related census levels fortunately have begun to peak, and we anticipate they will decline over the next few weeks. Same-facility revenues grew 6.4% in the quarter as compared to prior year. Inpatient revenue grew 2% and outpatient revenue grew 13%. Same-facility volumes increased on a year-over-year basis across most major categories, with the exception of inpatient surgeries, which were down 1%. In a challenging labor market, our teams adjusted well. Labor costs created some pressure on margins as compared to last year. But sequentially, there was no significant change in this metric as compared to the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was strong. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, increased 7% to $4.42 in the quarter. As we move into 2022, our overall outlook for the year remains generally consistent with the early perspectives we provided in last quarter's call. While certain aspects of our business, including the impact of the pandemic remain difficult to predict, we believe the guidance that we are providing today is reasonable. We also believe that the combination of our disciplined operating culture, plus our growth plan and the strong support from our capital deployment program, should help us deliver the results we are forecasting for the year and enhance long-term shareholder value. As I indicated previously, we believe demand for health care services will be strong in 2022 and comparable to historical growth rates in the 2% to 3% zone with COVID-related admissions representing between 3% and 5% of total. We expect this demand to be supported by a growing economy and more insurance coverage for people through their employer or the exchanges. We believe HCA Healthcare's strong and diversified portfolio of markets is differentiated across the industry and presents numerous long-term growth opportunities. Because of this, we plan to continue investing in our core strategy of developing our provider networks through our capital spending plan and also through acquisitions when available [Technical Difficulty] core acquisition that we completed at the end of the year in South Florida. These investments continue to add depth to our networks and convenience for our patients, creating an easier and more cost-effective accessibility for our health care systems. Over the past year, we have increased the ambulatory care sites in our networks by 14%, bringing the total number to approximately 2,200. These sites support the 182 hospitals we operate today and will provide support in the future to the eight new hospitals we recently announced in various Texas and Florida markets. As I mentioned, we are operating in a difficult labor market. Over the past year, we have invested in our colleagues with increased pay, supplemental bonus programs and additional benefits. These investments, coupled with our efforts to improve operational support for providing care, should help us mitigate some of the difficulties caused by this environment. These past two years certainly have been a strain on our people. But through it all, they have demonstrated a level of excellence, compassion and resilience that has strengthened the company in many ways. They have accomplished this while simultaneously staying true to our mission and better positioning us for continued success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for more details on the quarter's results, our '22 earnings guidance and capital deployment plan. Thank you.\nBill Rutherford: Okay, great. Thank you, Sam. And good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the year, then discuss our 2022 guidance. Our cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion as compared to a use of cash of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the prior year quarter, cash flow was affected by our returning or repaying early approximately $6 billion of Cares Act funding. For full year 2021, cash flow from operations was just under $9 billion. Capital spending was $1.2 billion for the quarter and was $3.6 billion for the full year 2021. In addition, we have approximately $4.1 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online over the next three years. We completed just over $2 billion of share repurchases during the quarter and $8.2 billion for the full year. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times at the end of the third quarter, and we had approximately $3.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. For full year 2021, we realized approximately $2.2 billion in proceeds from sales of facilities and health care entities and recognized approximately $1.6 billion in gains on these sales. We also executed on $1.1 billion of acquisitions on health care entities during the year. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year 2022 guidance as follows, we expect revenue to range between $60 billion and $62 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $5.55 billion and $5.835 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.55 billion and $13.05 billion. We expect full year diluted EPS to range between $18.40 and $19.20. And we expect capital spending to approximate $4.2 billion during the year. So let me provide some additional commentary on our guidance. The mid-point of our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $12.8 billion reflects a 1.2% increase over our 2021 adjusted EBITDA. In 2021, we recognized approximately $900 million in COVID support from the DRG add-on's HRSA reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients and the impact of the delay in sequestration cuts. We do not have full line of sight into all of these programs for the full year, but we do expect some benefit continuing, and our guidance anticipates approximately $150 million of support in 2022. In addition, our divestitures contributed about $140 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2021. When you consider these items, along with an estimate of about $300 million of incremental cost for serving COVID patients in 2021, our growth in adjusted EBITDA is consistent with our historical expectations for growth over time of 4% to 6%. Within guidance, we expect our same-facility admissions to grow approximately 2% to 3%, while revenue per admission to grow approximately 1%. We anticipate outpatient revenue to grow in the mid to high single digits. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA margin to range between 20% and 21% for the full year. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3 billion and interest expense is projected to be around $1.7 billion. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be about 303 million for the full year. Cash flow from operations is estimated to range between $9 billion and $9.5 billion. As also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program and declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.48 to $0.56 per share. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to open it up for Q&A.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Bill. Thank you, Sam. Chris, would you provide instructions on the queue for questions? And remind everyone to limit their questions to one, please, so that we can get as many people on this call as faster.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, great. Good morning.\nSam Hazen: Hey, Ann.\nAnn Hynes: Just a couple of \u2013 how are you? Just a couple of questions. So when I look at inpatient and outpatient versus 2009 [ph] they're down roughly 5%, which is a deterioration from prior quarters. Can you tell us what's driving that? Is it - I mean, obviously, it's staffing issues. So maybe what's driving the staffing issues versus COVID spikes and you are turning people away versus maybe a change in patient behavior? And then a quick clarification on your 2022 guidance, I think you said for 2021, you had about $300 million of incremental costs for COVID. Can you tell us what that is embedded in guidance for 2022? That would be great. Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Yeah. Ann, you were breaking up a little bit on your first question. The second, I think we all understood. The first, did anyone get that? Can you repeat that, Ann, please?\nAnn Hynes: Sure. So when I look at inpatient and outpatient trends in Q4 versus Q4 2019, they were down roughly by 5%, which is a slight deterioration from prior quarters. So can we just get some more color what's driving that? I mean, I know there's staffing issues. Are you not able to admit patients because of staffing issues? Or is it you're turning patients away because of COVID spikes or is it maybe a change in patient behavior? So if you can provide some color on that versus 2019?\nSam Hazen: I think a couple of high level observations that we believe are indicative of the fourth quarter of 2021 versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Obviously, we were carrying over into the fourth quarter a little bit of the Delta variant, and that was influencing some activity in some markets and we think that had some impact on the 2019 comparison. The second item would be that overall, we didn't see the same seasonality bump that we typically see in the fourth quarter. Again, we think that was influenced by the two different surges that were ramping down and ramping up. And then the third observation would be then on our inpatient activity. We have seen some migration in inpatient orthopedic surgeries primarily. And outpatient and that did influence the inpatient stat and propped up the outpatient stat somewhat with respect to surgeries. So those will be the three main drivers, I think, of the comparisons. All in all, we did have to manage some capacity in certain situations, again, of the COVID markets. And we're hopeful, again, as we wind down the Omicron variant, that we can get back to some normal period of business. Again, in the 2021, as I've said on our third quarter call, we really haven't had a normal run of what our business trends would be. We've had a holiday variant at the end of 2020 carried into 2021. We had the Delta variant in the middle. We had maybe three to four months where we can - there was no COVID influence of any significance. So we're making some judgments around those variations, but that would be the three level observations we have on the 2019 comparisons.\nBill Rutherford: Yeah. And 1Ann, this is Bill. On your second question regarding the $300 million of incremental costs, that would be above and beyond what we're anticipating next year. You know, we want to highlight the fact that we are seeing some decline in COVID support and acknowledge that we'd also expect to see some decline of some of that direct incremental costs. So that is above and beyond what we would expect.\nMark Kimbrough: And that could include drug-related PP&E and other related costs associated with treatment of COVID patients.\nAnn Hynes: Great. And congratulations on your retirement, Mark.\nMark Kimbrough: Thank you, Ann. Appreciate it.\nSam Hazen: Chris?\nOperator: Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. Yeah, it seems like HCA feels a little bit more controversial today than I'm used to it being, predominantly around where the margin should be normalizing out to. Obviously, this year, you're looking for lower margins than last year, but it's still nicely up from where 2019 was. Can you just level set for us where do you think ultimately those margins normalize into 2023 and beyond? And to the extent that it's above you know, the 19.5% in 2019, can you help us bridge what has gotten better sustainably from where you were pre=COVID? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Thanks, Kevin. Yeah, Kevin, this is Bill. I'll make a shot at that. So as you heard in our commentary, we expect margins to land between 20% and 21%. Obviously, as we know, we've talked about during this COVID period of time, when you compare it to pre COVID, we've seen a growth in acuity, as we've seen people return to have higher intensity of services. And we've lost a little bit of the lower acuity business during this period of time. And we've enjoyed a favorable payer mix as we \u2013 you know, a full employment effort, the activity in the health insurance exchanges. And so we saw obviously significant growth over the past, call it, six quarters since the middle of 2020. We expect those trends to remain positive, but maybe not at the same level. And that's helping drive some of the margins that we're seeing currently. And I think our view is that, you know, that coupled with other efforts, HCA had - that we should be able to land within the ranges we provided.\nKevin Fischbeck: Is that the right long-term amount as well?\nSam Hazen: Well, based on what we know today, there's no reason to presume we can't stay somewhere in that range. But obviously, there is a lot of variables to our business, and we'll have to advance our perspectives on those when we get those variables, I'll say, better understood over the course of this next year and so forth. But that's our thing. We've had a number, Kevin, financial resiliency initiatives, and we have ongoing initiatives that we think are positive to margin, all things equal. But we'll have to wait and see how some of these other components of our business develop over the course of 2022.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right, great. Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Mok with UBS Technology. Your line is open.\nAndrew Mok: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to echo congratulations to Mark on your retirement. On the 2022 guide, I want to make sure I understand the progression and development of the guide since the 3Q earnings call. Are you saying that since 3Q, you're now expecting more COVID patients and because government relief only gives us line of sight through April, you're planning for a significantly higher level of COVID costs in 2022? But only one quarter of extended government relief, such that there's somewhat of a mismatch in COVID cost and COVID relief in 2022?\nBill Rutherford: Thank you, Andrew. Yeah. I mean, I think our guidance is very consistent with what our third quarter commentary is. I mean, there's obviously a lot of moving parts. I think the COVID volume we're anticipating now, as Sam mentioned, between 3% to 5% is consistent with where we thought COVID volume would be when we provided our third quarter. The COVID support programs that we mentioned, I think, are pretty close to what we anticipated during that discussion. So you know, without talking about the progression of those occurring during the year, I think overall, our guidance is very consistent with what our commentary and what our beliefs were at the end of the third quarter.\nAndrew Mok: Got it. Okay.\nBill Rutherford: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Obviously, first, Mark, thanks for everything over 20 years. Enjoy your retirement, you'll be missed. Then from a question perspective, maybe you can talk a little bit about two things, right? So one, your - you - we think you got some dollars, at least - there are some articles out there that you might have got about $250 million from Florida in terms of extra Medicaid payments. Can you talk a little bit about that? Was it recognized in the fourth quarter? Is it in the guidance for 2022 or because you - maybe you haven't gotten it yet so you didn't recognize it yet. So that's number one. And then number two, just in terms of your pricing assumption in terms of revenue per admit. Is it fair to say then that the - versus the typical 2% to 3% you're saying, one, you're assuming maybe about 1% of that is kind of a headwind from government dollars that are going to be down materially. And then the other 1% is a little bit of \u2013 you know, the extra 1% maybe a little bit of payer mix deterioration? Is that a reasonable way to think about it?\nBill Rutherford: All right, Justin. Yeah. So let me try to address that. So let me talk about Florida and the other supplemental programs that we have in the quarter. And I know there's been a lot of discussion. We are participating in the Florida DPP program. And in the fourth quarter, we did recognize a net benefit of approximately $130 million related to that program, we do expect to recognize a similar benefit in the latter half in 2022 as well. But I also want to talk about Texas for a moment. I think it's been reported that CMS has not yet approved the Medicaid directed payment program in Texas that's to go into effect September 1st, of '21. And as a result of this new program not being approved, we did not record any revenue anticipated with this aspect of the waiver program in the latter four months of the year. So this equated to about $120 million reduction in our waiver revenue in the fourth quarter compared to what we had recognized in the three previous quarters. So it largely offset the impact of the Florida program in our consolidated results. We believe eventually, the Texas program will be worked out, and we don't anticipate it being a headwind for 2022. But our full year guidance anticipates that we'll be able to recognize that annual historical level over time, even though it may take some time for the state of Texas and CMS to work that through. On the pricing side, our revenue per admit at 1%, you're right, it's a little lower than maybe historically on there. When you adjust for the COVID, it does add about point so I think that's right. And then when you think our outpatient revenue growth, as I mentioned, we expect to be in the mid to high single digits, and you blend that, I think it would look relatively consistent when you look at revenue per equivalent admission. So we think it's generally in the range of what our historical trends would indicate.\nJustin Lake: Okay. Can I just ask a quick follow-up, Bill, on the Texas and Florida? So the way to think about them for 2022 is you're building in this extra, and let's say, $130 million for Florida is in the '22 guidance. And then theoretically, you would also have a catch-up, right, from the fourth quarter of those last four months where there's an extra $130 million. So there's another $200 million and, let's say, $50 million of kind of extra dollars that are either at a period or probably may or may not continue from Florida and Texas in 2022? Is that the right way to think about it?\nBill Rutherford: Well, just I think in our guidance, we're anticipating an annual amount, a 12 month in our guidance, we're not anticipating the catch-up, just given the uncertainty of how that may settle out. So we're going to have to wait to see how that is developed. The state of Texas is testing that federal program. We're hoping that we get some understanding of that soon. So our guidance really reflects an annual amount, not necessarily a catch-up amount from this year. And so we'll just have to see how that plays out.\nJustin Lake: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nBill Rutherford: Thank you, Justin. Operator Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks, everybody. And best wishes, Mark. I will say how long we've interacting. But maybe I'll pivot and ask about, you guys have talked about from time to time in the COVID crisis, there you know, some of the downstream ability to discharge has been challenging home health, SNFs whatever. And you've also talked about that making - maybe having some impact on your capital deployment priorities. Can you just give us your updated thoughts as you see Delta moderate, Omicron come surge. Are you seeing issues with being able to discharge patients in the time frame you'd want? And any updated thoughts on having any of those areas, as particular, new or increased capital priorities?\nSam Hazen: Thank you, A.J. One of the areas that we're focused on and it's connected really to our labor agenda and it's connected to our overall business agenda for 2022 is managing capacity and throughput most effectively. So case management linked to state management, discharge planning to post-acute in other settings is very important to our success, ER throughput. All of those elements are very important to our ability to manage capacity. And then clearly, we have to execute on our labor agenda, and we have a robust labor agenda to respond to the issues that we face on the people side of our equation. And as it relates to the surges, discharge planning during the surges has been a little bit more difficult. It's been more difficult in the Omicron variant because the nursing home environment and even the home care environment has been suffering from employees who have been infected by the Omicron variant. And so that's created a little bit of a contraction, we think, in some markets with overall post-acute capacity. And that has delayed our ability to execute on our discharge planning process as we ordinarily would. As it pertains, A.J., to our capital planning, as you know, we did acquire the home care and hospice business unit from Brookdale. We have been in the process of integrating that business into our company. And the first part of this year has been about integration. We sold non-overlap components to another home care company, and then we've been organizing ourselves around home care and hospitals inside of the markets where we overlap. And so again, we're in the early stages of integration. We're looking for some significant strides on that front in '22. Additionally, we're making significant investments in rehab, as we've mentioned on these calls in the past, particularly in Florida but also in other components of our business. And we think that will enhance our ability to manage the post-acute discharge process a little bit more efficiently. We also have preferred networks that we've evolved with our bundled payment programs over the years with certain providers in post-acute. We will continue to leverage and build on those relationships, allowing us hopefully to maintain efficient discharge planning process. The last thing I would say on that front as well is our case management program is continuing to be advanced in our company. We are implementing technology. We are deploying certain shared services capabilities around utilization review and so forth. And we think those initiatives are going to yield benefits for us as it relates to capacity management. So a lot of components to this, A.J., overall capital spending, however, to sum it all up here materially changing from what we previously indicated.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to echo everyone's comments, Mark, a big thank you. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years. And Frank, I look forward to working with you again in the future. So guys, I'm asking a single sort of multipart question here. So labor is obviously a big topic these days. So the first question is, how should we model the cadence of earnings in 2022 versus the pre-COVID year? Number two, on 3.8% [ph] of revenue growth guidance, you're only guiding to 50 basis points of margin compression despite these labor pressures. Can you give us any color on where salvage benefits tracks in '22 versus '21? Any other color on supply in OpEx? And then finally, number three, what assumptions are you making on labor costs sort of throughout the year? Do you have a moderating stagnant levels? Any color you can give us there?\nBill Rutherford: Thank you. Pito, this Bill. Let me start with the quarterly case. Obviously, we don't give specific guidance. But I think when you consider the discussion I had around the Texas waiver program, and we think that will take some time to settle out potentially even into the second half of the year. And then we think about labor, you know, where the current trends probably more pressured in the first half of the year, we think we can continue to manage through those in the second half of the year. I think it's reasonable to expect that our growth will be weighted in the second half of the year. We expect that as we've seen the utilization of some of our premium labor, especially around contract labor, that we can ease that as we go through the balance of the year as, hopefully, we get out of a COVID surge environment. And that will provide some relief as we progress through the second half of 2022. On supplies and OpEx, our assumptions are really consistent with our trends. When I look at those two areas as a percentage of revenue, they stay pretty close in terms of the variability from period to period. So there is really no major tailwinds or headwinds that I would call out on those. I think our supply trends and our other operating trends would be consistent with, I think, what we've seen throughout most of this year.\nPito Chickering: Okay, great. And actually, a follow-up question on the premium labor. Can you quantify how much premium labor you guys saw in the fourth quarter and what you're assuming in 2022? Thanks so much.\nBill Rutherford: Well, I think it's - we did obviously have to utilize higher contract labor. I think the impact was as much about the cost to procure contract labor as it was the utilization. Our contract labor FTEs were up maybe 10% compared to where we ran in the first quarter. But the cost to procure that contract labor update was up significantly. So we believe that as the COVID surges begin to dissipate, that the cost per contract labor will be able to manage through that and manage that down. So those are basically the numbers right now.\nPito Chickering: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Whit Mayo with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, Thanks. Best wishes, Mark. Bill, my question is when I look at the framework that you've offered up for 2022, I may be off a point or so here. But if COVID is budgeted to be 3% to 5% of your total admissions, it does seem to imply that non-COVID admissions grow maybe somewhere in the high single-digit range, but that could be roughly flat versus 2019. So I'm just trying to see if you can put into context that the growth in non-COVID and how that's been trending. And maybe any color around service lines just to help us bridge that increase. And any views on maybe the first quarter could be helpful? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: All right. Thank you, Whit. If you look at COVID in discrete terms, you're probably not incorrect with some of your estimations. But I don't think we're viewing COVID completely discrete in the sense that some of those patients would still be entering the system regardless of COVID, and that was especially true in the fourth quarter as we looked at some of our COVID patients and such that they were coming in for different reasons. And then they were also COVID positive because many people didn't even know they had COVID. So I think you have to sort of look at it as a bit of a mixed bag there and that's how we're judging it as well. I do believe that there was deferred demand, and it still showed itself in the quarter and will yield some recovery in the first part of 2022. I mean, literally, we had surgeons who were closing practices, canceling cases because they themselves contracted the Omicron variant. So I think from that standpoint, there is the typical COVID impact on volumes in the quarter while we're experiencing a surge. But we believe, again, you know, that strong job growth across our portfolio of markets, more people covered by the exchange, deferrals, some elective and transfer closures across our portfolio all bode well for our ability to recover volume in 2022. Again, as I mentioned to A.J., we have to manage capacity. We have to supply that capacity with labor, and we're working through all of those elements as we speak to put ourselves in the best position to receive that demand. We're very excited about the prospects for growth across the company, as I mentioned in my comments. We're investing in that. We've announced, as I mentioned, eight new hospitals, recognized some of the overall growth that exists in these markets. We've had momentum. If you look at our market share at the end of 2019, it was north of 26.5%. It ended with the most recent data that we which is about 1.5 years later, right under 28% so we gained share during COVID. We've positioned our organization, we believe, with our ambulatory network better. And when we bump that up to what we're judging to be some demand that's been dislocated by the COVID surges, we feel like our guidance is reasonable.\nWhit Mayo: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nSam Hazen: All right. Thanks, Whit. Operator Your next question is from Sarah James with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSarah James: Thank you. And I echo the heartfelt comments to Mark.\nMark Kimbrough: Thank you.\nSarah James: Much of the wage inflation environment do you think of as a structural shift or a shift in how we think about the base wage range for nurses? And how does that impact your conversations with payers and how you think about CapEx or capital deployment mix?\nSam Hazen: Thank you, Sarah. Well, as Bill mentioned, the market has been significantly disrupted, the labor market that it has been significantly disrupted with COVID. What we see during COVID surges is more opportunities for our nurses and other people's nurses to go into a traveler and get a really outsized rate. We think as COVID surges moderate, that is going to moderate the overall market to some degree. We have advanced our wages for our employees. We've advanced some of our benefits. We've provided certain shift bonuses throughout the year, and that has yielded some increased rate of wage growth for our employee base. We think, however, moving into 2022 as we go through the moderation on the contract labor, we'll be able to absorb the wage trends that are built into our employee base over the course of '22 and land somewhere around 3% to 3.5% possibly on a composite basis for our cost per FTE. And that, we believe, is a something that we can absorb in our guidance. As it relates to our payer contracts, yes, we are talking to them about inflationary pressures and how that will influence future contracting. At this particular point in time, our book-of-business for 2022 is pretty much accomplished and part of '23 is accomplished. But we're building in some flexibility to reflect the inflationary pressures that might exist and we'll continue to work through those as we work through our contract portfolio with the different payers. But I think in general, they understand the pressures that providers are facing on that front, and they have the unique ability to adjust their premiums on an annual basis in most instances. And that should line-up with the need for us to get a fair cost increase related to inflation.\nMark Kimbrough: All right, Sarah, thanks.\nSarah James: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. And will echo the thanks to Mark and best wishes to Frank. Had a question was interested to get a few more details on the eight hospitals that you're \u2013 that you've announced that you're going to plan to build an aggregate in Florida and in Texas. And just specifically interested if you could talk about what the overall related CapEx would be for those facilities and the ROIC that you think you can generate on them. And then also maybe an aggregate sort of new beds that you'll think that you'll be able to add from those eighty facilities and when, in terms of timing, those are expected to come online? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: All right, Scott. Thanks. Well, I would submit that the eight projects that we've announced is not going to materially change our capital thinking over the next two to three years. We believe we can absorb most of that in what will be a budget that's approximately what we're indicating for, for this year. The situation is this. I mean, some of these markets are growing significantly often. This, as everybody probably knows, is growing in a way that is creating opportunities for us, just like it's creating opportunities for others in that community. But with the growth in that market and with the occupancy that we currently run in Austin, Texas, as an example, it presents a nice platform for us to expand into some of these growing areas and add to our network. Most of these hospitals will be primary and secondary care type hospitals with basic inpatient services and many outpatient services. And then to the extent that these patients need deeper, more acute care, we obviously have those capabilities in or different markets. We have the same situation in Florida with the exception of one hospital that we're building in Fort Myers, which is a new market for us. And we're extending into that market because there's a need for more capacity and it's proximal to one of our west markets in a way that we think we can create synergies. So I think with respect to returns, we have a pattern, we believe of producing very solid projects. It's reflected in our return on capital overall. And we anticipate that these projects over time will yield the same kind of value that we've typically generate with capital programs. So that's where we are with them. Again, most of them are going to be 50 to 75 beds starting out. They're not huge hospitals. They're complementary assets that, over time, will hopefully grow to more acute and more capable facilities with respect to service offerings.\nScott Fidel: All right. Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Mark, congrats. Not to make you feel old, but I think HCA had $2 billion of revenue in 1982 when you started so you've come a long way.\nMark Kimbrough: That's right. I remember. Thank you.\nGary Taylor: One clarification and one question. I just want to clarify, the Utah hospital's not yet in the guide. And then my question just going back to labor, I know you've covered a lot on it, I appreciate it. But Bill, on the 3Q, you had talked about contract labor over time, shift differentials and you had said 10% to 12% of FTEs were in those premium categories. And I think you - I think all three of those were included in sort of the premium categories. So I just wanted to get a sense sequentially if you have that figure, if there's a sense that, that eased at all yet or we're still waiting to see that.\nBill Rutherford: This is Bill. To answer, yes, Utah is not in our guidance. So we're still in a regulatory review process, so we've not included any of that in our guidance. Regarding the contract labor and premium labor trends, we did see some improvement as we went through the fourth quarter. I think the number is closer to 11% of our nursing hours were contract hours in the fourth quarter. So there is some slight improvement going forward. And as we think about in my earlier commentary, we think in the first half of '22, we'll continue to see that pressure over time as the year goes on, as hopefully dissipates, we'll be able to manage that process down.\nGary Taylor: Thank you.\nSam Hazen: All right. Thanks, Gary.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJamie Perse: Hey. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask one clarification first. On the COVID DRG and HRSA sequestration for 2021, if you can give a breakdown of that $900 million, and same thing for 2022, the $150 million that you're planning for? And then my real question is just around, I think, it was getting to this question, but the implied non-COVID volume in 2022. You're certainly not implying you get back to trend line maybe back to 2019 levels. But really what is the bottleneck to get back to trend line growth? Is it discharge capacity, labor capacity? What are those bottlenecks that you would have to work through to see upside for your non-COVID volumes?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Let me take the first part of that, the breakdown of the COVID support. It was roughly $180 million from the DRG add-ons. The sequestration delay was about $200 million for us in '21. And then we had a little over million of HRSA reimbursement and then a little bit of technology add-on payments after that. Regarding '22, we know we have some visibility into the sequestration being phased in. I would say it's roughly half of the $150 million we talked about and the rest being from the other programs.\nSam Hazen: I think on the capacity side of the equation, again, if you categorize how we're approaching making sure we have adequate capacity, we have to execute on these categories in order to achieve that. First is staffing. We have to retain the staff we have. We have to recruit new staff, and we have to manage that obviously effectively. And again, we have a number of initiatives in place to deal with that and I'm encouraged by our hiring. We've advanced our recruiting agenda. We've got improvements in certain categories with turnover, and again, getting through COVID surges will be helpful to that. The second thing we're working on is something we're calling new models of care. We're exploring and experimenting with different approaches to staffing models that allow our nurses to be supported by different approaches and creating more capacity, if you will, for our nurse population in a way that delivers the patient outcomes we want and recognize that some of the market issues. And then the final piece is what I had mentioned previously around throughput and capacity management. And again, case management is a piece of that. Telemedicine inside of our hospitals is a piece of that. Load balancing across all of our bed capacity market is a piece of that. So we have a lot of elements of technology also factors into that and how we're using some new technology solutions to help us in throughput management. So those are the areas that we're focused on. And I've got confidence in our teams and our ability to execute around these categories and deliver the capacity that we're going to need in order to take care of the demand that's going to be in the communities.\nJamie Perse: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Cassorla with Citi. Your line is open.\nJason Cassorla: Thanks for taking my question. I guess just on the payer mix side, can you help flush out the volume growth in the quarter by payer cohort and how you're thinking about 2022 in context of that 2% to 3% overall volume growth embedded in guidance? I guess you suggest stability in payer mix for '22, but just wondering how you're thinking about the impact of any potential Medicaid re-verification activity and especially the pickup in the marketplace enrollment in your bigger states, I think, particularly in Texas. So any help there would be great. Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yeah. I mean, in the quarter, we saw a continued favorable payer mix. Our managed care book for the quarter was up about 2.6% compared to our overall admissions that became favorable. That was partly driven, if not mostly driven by the health insurance exchange volume, we continue to see that we've talked about good enrollment and going into that. As we go forward into '22, as I mentioned in my comments, I think we're expecting that our acuity and payer mix should continue to be positive trends, maybe not at the same pace we've seen over this past several quarters but we expect some continued positive growth on that. Relative to the Medicaid piece, we've seen some pluses and minuses of Medicaid. Medicaid growth is up a little higher than our average. In terms of expectations for next year, I think they would be mostly consistent with what our recent trends have been. I'm not so sure what else was tagged in on his question.\nJason Cassorla: All right. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey. Good morning, guys. And Mark, thanks again for all the help over the years. I guess Sam my question, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how you saw the migration of inpatient ortho to outpatients. So just wondering how you're thinking about strategizing around that and how that plays out going forward. And maybe any color you can share on the difference in economics, maybe on an EBITDA basis, apples-to-apples for procedures inpatient versus outpatient on ortho?\nSam Hazen: So our total orthopedic volume, surgical volumes were up when you look at inpatient and outpatient in total. We have a physician alignment strategy with our orthopedic community that we think is yielding value. We continue to iterate on that to respond to some of the individual needs from one market to the other. The second piece of our strategy is around our outpatient elements and how we manage our surgical space in the hospitals for outpatient cases, and then also in our ambulatory surgery centers where we have orthopedic partners. So we have a multi-pronged approach to orthopedics, just like we do with most service lines, and it involves our quality agenda, our service agenda, our facility agenda and then our physicians. And so we have the same dynamic with orthopedics. The reimbursement per case is obviously less in an outpatient environment than it is in an inpatient. But I think the important thing about HCA Healthcare is we have such a diversification of services. And no one service provides a disproportionate amount of revenue or profits for the company. So when there's migration from one setting to the other, it doesn't necessarily change the overall equation for the company. And that's what we're seeing with orthopedics today. It's migrating. We've had other service lines over the years migrate from inpatient to outpatient. And we've been able to manage through that and actually create market share momentum around that transition, and we're believing that we have the right approach here with orthopedics as well.\nBrian Tanquilut: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kelvin Sternick [ph] with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to circle back to some of the Medicaid comments you made, specifically related to re-determinations. Just want to understand what's assumed in your guys guidance with respect to the resumption of Medicaid re-determinations and whether or not you think that has a discernible impact on your numbers, particularly in the back half? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Clear when you say re-determinations, we talked about the supplemental programs.\nMark Kimbrough: Rate determinations.\nBill Rutherford: Around eligibility. Yeah. I don't think there's any material assumptions in terms of changes of that into our expectations going forward. We haven't heard any discussion of that impact in our Medicaid volume projections going forward. So I would tell you that I think for next year, it's built on our historical trends remaining pretty consistent.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Thanks, Kevin.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. Chris, we got time for two questions, please.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question is from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Raskin: Great. Thanks for taking me in. And congrats, Mark, and welcome Frank as well. On the labor front, I'm curious if you're seeing competition for clinical labor, specifically physicians, nurses, et cetera, that's mostly coming from other hospitals competing hospitals or maybe staffing situations. Or are there trends where individuals, the clinical labor is going to other areas, other sites or maybe even leaving health care because we continue to see that in media reports. And then maybe just a comment on Galen and the impact that, that's having and how that may be a competitive advantage for HCA?\nSam Hazen: Well, I think all of the above on labor. I mean, there's clearly competition for labor, not just in clinical labor, but non-clinical labor, too. The service side of our agenda, we have competitive dynamics on that labor front as well. So we're no different than any other industry when it comes to that. I think, again, we have advanced our recruitment very significantly, and we're recruiting significant numbers of nurses. We have retention efforts that I think are going to pay off. The care transformation that I mentioned in capacity management, all that's connected to a staffing solution for our company. And we're competing very aggressive in this space, just like we compete for physicians, just like we compete for patients and so forth. So I'm confident in our competitive abilities on this particular agenda. Galen is off to a great start. We acquired it, and we're limited to when we could start our expansions. We started our expansion this past year. I think we have 12 new schools in the pipeline, maybe six or eight of them have actually opened, one in Austin and one in Nashville. We're both the fastest ramp-up in new enrollment history of Galen, their CEO told me. So we're very excited about the prospects. It will take us time to graduate these nurses, but we expect to have 12 to 18 new schools over the next two to three years, and that should yield a number of new students for us. We will integrate those students into our facilities in ways that hopefully secure an employment opportunity for them in an HCA facility when they graduate. We anticipate tripling the number of graduates over what they currently produce by 2026, which yield a reasonable growth in number of nurses in the communities that, again, hopefully, we can retain into our facilities. We believe our faculty will be supported by HCA nursing leadership, and the externs programs that we'll use for students in the Galen school will be integrated into HCA procedures, systems and so forth. And we do think that creates some advantage in securing these graduates into our facilities.\nJoshua Raskin: All right. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our final question is from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBen Hendrix: Hey, thanks, guys for squeezing me in at the end. And congratulations to both Mark and Frank. I think most of my questions have been answered, and you've touched on this. But just kind of get your inpatient care delivery efforts and then length of stay management, this is all a consistent theme we've heard from your competitors. Certainly, Tenet has talked about this and Community as well. But just wanted to get a little bit more color on what you think are your key differentiators, whether that be your scale, your approach, and kind of what might give HCA the competitive advantage in that endeavour? And then a follow-on to that, kind of what inning are we in? How much room to run do we have on getting efficiency out of - specifically the care delivery?\nSam Hazen: All right. Thanks, Ben. I don't know what the other companies are necessarily saying about this particular agenda. I think what we're trying to do is make sure we're using technology. We have training and visibility into the processes that make a difference in case management. And then we're ultimately using our capacity broadly across the markets to support better throughput and overall capacity management. And then, as I mentioned, we've advanced our capabilities in post-acute with our own acquisitions and development, as well as relationships with others. And I think the combination of all of those elements create an opportunity for us to gain more efficiencies through our case management programs overall. And we think also that will help us with our receivables and our management of denials and so forth with the payers, and there is some yield on that front as well. So we're pretty excited about the developments in this area. How much more advantage we are than others, I can't really speak to that.\nBen Hendrix: All right.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the call over to Mr. Hazen for any closing remarks.\nSam Hazen: Yeah. Well, thank you again for participating on our call, and I wanted to take this moment to thank Mark for his 39 years of service. He and I both have worked 39 years with the company. I'm not sure why he's retiring. But nonetheless, he has had a wonderful career and represented our company incredibly well with our shareholders and others, and I want to thank him for that. And again, welcome, Frank, to the team. Frank's going to do a wonderful job as well. So Mark, congratulations, and we wish you the best.\nMark Kimbrough: Well, I wanted to say thanks, too. And finishing up our - my final earnings call, I wanted to thank Sam and Bill and all the others I've known and worked alongside these past 39 plus years. I truly enjoyed working with everyone here at HCA and all of you listening on the call today, too. I also want to thank Dr. Frist for his vision in creating HCA and Vic Campbell for his years of mentoring and friendship to me over the past decades. Frank and I will be here to answer any further questions you might have following this call, so feel free to give us a shout this afternoon or the week. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Okay, great. Thank you, Sam. And good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the year, then discuss our 2022 guidance. Our cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion as compared to a use of cash of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the prior year quarter, cash flow was affected by our returning or repaying early approximately $6 billion of Cares Act funding. For full year 2021, cash flow from operations was just under $9 billion. Capital spending was $1.2 billion for the quarter and was $3.6 billion for the full year 2021. In addition, we have approximately $4.1 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online over the next three years. We completed just over $2 billion of share repurchases during the quarter and $8.2 billion for the full year. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times at the end of the third quarter, and we had approximately $3.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. For full year 2021, we realized approximately $2.2 billion in proceeds from sales of facilities and health care entities and recognized approximately $1.6 billion in gains on these sales. We also executed on $1.1 billion of acquisitions on health care entities during the year. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year 2022 guidance as follows, we expect revenue to range between $60 billion and $62 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $5.55 billion and $5.835 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.55 billion and $13.05 billion. We expect full year diluted EPS to range between $18.40 and $19.20. And we expect capital spending to approximate $4.2 billion during the year. So let me provide some additional commentary on our guidance. The mid-point of our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $12.8 billion reflects a 1.2% increase over our 2021 adjusted EBITDA. In 2021, we recognized approximately $900 million in COVID support from the DRG add-on's HRSA reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients and the impact of the delay in sequestration cuts. We do not have full line of sight into all of these programs for the full year, but we do expect some benefit continuing, and our guidance anticipates approximately $150 million of support in 2022. In addition, our divestitures contributed about $140 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2021. When you consider these items, along with an estimate of about $300 million of incremental cost for serving COVID patients in 2021, our growth in adjusted EBITDA is consistent with our historical expectations for growth over time of 4% to 6%. Within guidance, we expect our same-facility admissions to grow approximately 2% to 3%, while revenue per admission to grow approximately 1%. We anticipate outpatient revenue to grow in the mid to high single digits. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA margin to range between 20% and 21% for the full year. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3 billion and interest expense is projected to be around $1.7 billion. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be about 303 million for the full year. Cash flow from operations is estimated to range between $9 billion and $9.5 billion. As also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program and declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.48 to $0.56 per share. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to open it up for Q&A. Yeah. And 1Ann, this is Bill. On your second question regarding the $300 million of incremental costs, that would be above and beyond what we're anticipating next year. You know, we want to highlight the fact that we are seeing some decline in COVID support and acknowledge that we'd also expect to see some decline of some of that direct incremental costs. So that is above and beyond what we would expect. Thanks, Kevin. Yeah, Kevin, this is Bill. I'll make a shot at that. So as you heard in our commentary, we expect margins to land between 20% and 21%. Obviously, as we know, we've talked about during this COVID period of time, when you compare it to pre COVID, we've seen a growth in acuity, as we've seen people return to have higher intensity of services. And we've lost a little bit of the lower acuity business during this period of time. And we've enjoyed a favorable payer mix as we \u2013 you know, a full employment effort, the activity in the health insurance exchanges. And so we saw obviously significant growth over the past, call it, six quarters since the middle of 2020. We expect those trends to remain positive, but maybe not at the same level. And that's helping drive some of the margins that we're seeing currently. And I think our view is that, you know, that coupled with other efforts, HCA had - that we should be able to land within the ranges we provided. Thank you, Andrew. Yeah. I mean, I think our guidance is very consistent with what our third quarter commentary is. I mean, there's obviously a lot of moving parts. I think the COVID volume we're anticipating now, as Sam mentioned, between 3% to 5% is consistent with where we thought COVID volume would be when we provided our third quarter. The COVID support programs that we mentioned, I think, are pretty close to what we anticipated during that discussion. So you know, without talking about the progression of those occurring during the year, I think overall, our guidance is very consistent with what our commentary and what our beliefs were at the end of the third quarter. Appreciate it. All right, Justin. Yeah. So let me try to address that. So let me talk about Florida and the other supplemental programs that we have in the quarter. And I know there's been a lot of discussion. We are participating in the Florida DPP program. And in the fourth quarter, we did recognize a net benefit of approximately $130 million related to that program, we do expect to recognize a similar benefit in the latter half in 2022 as well. But I also want to talk about Texas for a moment. I think it's been reported that CMS has not yet approved the Medicaid directed payment program in Texas that's to go into effect September 1st, of '21. And as a result of this new program not being approved, we did not record any revenue anticipated with this aspect of the waiver program in the latter four months of the year. So this equated to about $120 million reduction in our waiver revenue in the fourth quarter compared to what we had recognized in the three previous quarters. So it largely offset the impact of the Florida program in our consolidated results. We believe eventually, the Texas program will be worked out, and we don't anticipate it being a headwind for 2022. But our full year guidance anticipates that we'll be able to recognize that annual historical level over time, even though it may take some time for the state of Texas and CMS to work that through. On the pricing side, our revenue per admit at 1%, you're right, it's a little lower than maybe historically on there. When you adjust for the COVID, it does add about point so I think that's right. And then when you think our outpatient revenue growth, as I mentioned, we expect to be in the mid to high single digits, and you blend that, I think it would look relatively consistent when you look at revenue per equivalent admission. So we think it's generally in the range of what our historical trends would indicate. Well, just I think in our guidance, we're anticipating an annual amount, a 12 month in our guidance, we're not anticipating the catch-up, just given the uncertainty of how that may settle out. So we're going to have to wait to see how that is developed. The state of Texas is testing that federal program. We're hoping that we get some understanding of that soon. So our guidance really reflects an annual amount, not necessarily a catch-up amount from this year. And so we'll just have to see how that plays out. Thank you, Justin. Operator Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thank you. Pito, this Bill. Let me start with the quarterly case. Obviously, we don't give specific guidance. But I think when you consider the discussion I had around the Texas waiver program, and we think that will take some time to settle out potentially even into the second half of the year. And then we think about labor, you know, where the current trends probably more pressured in the first half of the year, we think we can continue to manage through those in the second half of the year. I think it's reasonable to expect that our growth will be weighted in the second half of the year. We expect that as we've seen the utilization of some of our premium labor, especially around contract labor, that we can ease that as we go through the balance of the year as, hopefully, we get out of a COVID surge environment. And that will provide some relief as we progress through the second half of 2022. On supplies and OpEx, our assumptions are really consistent with our trends. When I look at those two areas as a percentage of revenue, they stay pretty close in terms of the variability from period to period. So there is really no major tailwinds or headwinds that I would call out on those. I think our supply trends and our other operating trends would be consistent with, I think, what we've seen throughout most of this year. Well, I think it's - we did obviously have to utilize higher contract labor. I think the impact was as much about the cost to procure contract labor as it was the utilization. Our contract labor FTEs were up maybe 10% compared to where we ran in the first quarter. But the cost to procure that contract labor update was up significantly. So we believe that as the COVID surges begin to dissipate, that the cost per contract labor will be able to manage through that and manage that down. So those are basically the numbers right now. This is Bill. To answer, yes, Utah is not in our guidance. So we're still in a regulatory review process, so we've not included any of that in our guidance. Regarding the contract labor and premium labor trends, we did see some improvement as we went through the fourth quarter. I think the number is closer to 11% of our nursing hours were contract hours in the fourth quarter. So there is some slight improvement going forward. And as we think about in my earlier commentary, we think in the first half of '22, we'll continue to see that pressure over time as the year goes on, as hopefully dissipates, we'll be able to manage that process down. Yes. Let me take the first part of that, the breakdown of the COVID support. It was roughly $180 million from the DRG add-ons. The sequestration delay was about $200 million for us in '21. And then we had a little over million of HRSA reimbursement and then a little bit of technology add-on payments after that. Regarding '22, we know we have some visibility into the sequestration being phased in. I would say it's roughly half of the $150 million we talked about and the rest being from the other programs. Yeah. I mean, in the quarter, we saw a continued favorable payer mix. Our managed care book for the quarter was up about 2.6% compared to our overall admissions that became favorable. That was partly driven, if not mostly driven by the health insurance exchange volume, we continue to see that we've talked about good enrollment and going into that. As we go forward into '22, as I mentioned in my comments, I think we're expecting that our acuity and payer mix should continue to be positive trends, maybe not at the same pace we've seen over this past several quarters but we expect some continued positive growth on that. Relative to the Medicaid piece, we've seen some pluses and minuses of Medicaid. Medicaid growth is up a little higher than our average. In terms of expectations for next year, I think they would be mostly consistent with what our recent trends have been. I'm not so sure what else was tagged in on his question. Clear when you say re-determinations, we talked about the supplemental programs. Around eligibility. Yeah. I don't think there's any material assumptions in terms of changes of that into our expectations going forward. We haven't heard any discussion of that impact in our Medicaid volume projections going forward. So I would tell you that I think for next year, it's built on our historical trends remaining pretty consistent."

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Mark. And good morning, and thank you for joining us. As we begin this call, I want to reflect on 2021. Across many dimensions of our business, our teams demonstrated an impressive ability to adjust quickly and effectively to three different surges and deliver for our patients, deliver for our communities and deliver for each other. This steadfast resolve and sacrifice to serve others are what make health care workers special people in general, but specifically for HCA Healthcare, they are what make our company great. I want to thank our colleagues and physicians for their outstanding work this past year. In the fourth quarter, the COVID pandemic once again altered course with the Omicron variant. As the Delta variant surge was slowing down at the end of the third quarter with some spill-over into the fourth, the Omicron surge started to influence our business in early December. Overall, our teams continued their tremendous response and the effects of the pandemic's ever changing conditions were managed well as reflected in our financial results for the fourth quarter, which were solid and in line with our most recent guidance. In the quarter, our hospitals provided care to 27,000 COVID-19 patients, approximately 5% of total admissions. This level is significantly below the third quarter's 13%. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have provided inpatient care to over 260,000 patients who contracted the virus. Currently, our hospitals continue to treat many patients with COVID-19. COVID-related census levels fortunately have begun to peak, and we anticipate they will decline over the next few weeks. Same-facility revenues grew 6.4% in the quarter as compared to prior year. Inpatient revenue grew 2% and outpatient revenue grew 13%. Same-facility volumes increased on a year-over-year basis across most major categories, with the exception of inpatient surgeries, which were down 1%. In a challenging labor market, our teams adjusted well. Labor costs created some pressure on margins as compared to last year. But sequentially, there was no significant change in this metric as compared to the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was strong. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, increased 7% to $4.42 in the quarter. As we move into 2022, our overall outlook for the year remains generally consistent with the early perspectives we provided in last quarter's call. While certain aspects of our business, including the impact of the pandemic remain difficult to predict, we believe the guidance that we are providing today is reasonable. We also believe that the combination of our disciplined operating culture, plus our growth plan and the strong support from our capital deployment program, should help us deliver the results we are forecasting for the year and enhance long-term shareholder value. As I indicated previously, we believe demand for health care services will be strong in 2022 and comparable to historical growth rates in the 2% to 3% zone with COVID-related admissions representing between 3% and 5% of total. We expect this demand to be supported by a growing economy and more insurance coverage for people through their employer or the exchanges. We believe HCA Healthcare's strong and diversified portfolio of markets is differentiated across the industry and presents numerous long-term growth opportunities. Because of this, we plan to continue investing in our core strategy of developing our provider networks through our capital spending plan and also through acquisitions when available [Technical Difficulty] core acquisition that we completed at the end of the year in South Florida. These investments continue to add depth to our networks and convenience for our patients, creating an easier and more cost-effective accessibility for our health care systems. Over the past year, we have increased the ambulatory care sites in our networks by 14%, bringing the total number to approximately 2,200. These sites support the 182 hospitals we operate today and will provide support in the future to the eight new hospitals we recently announced in various Texas and Florida markets. As I mentioned, we are operating in a difficult labor market. Over the past year, we have invested in our colleagues with increased pay, supplemental bonus programs and additional benefits. These investments, coupled with our efforts to improve operational support for providing care, should help us mitigate some of the difficulties caused by this environment. These past two years certainly have been a strain on our people. But through it all, they have demonstrated a level of excellence, compassion and resilience that has strengthened the company in many ways. They have accomplished this while simultaneously staying true to our mission and better positioning us for continued success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for more details on the quarter's results, our '22 earnings guidance and capital deployment plan. Thank you. Hey, Ann. Yeah. Ann, you were breaking up a little bit on your first question. The second, I think we all understood. The first, did anyone get that? Can you repeat that, Ann, please? I think a couple of high level observations that we believe are indicative of the fourth quarter of 2021 versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Obviously, we were carrying over into the fourth quarter a little bit of the Delta variant, and that was influencing some activity in some markets and we think that had some impact on the 2019 comparison. The second item would be that overall, we didn't see the same seasonality bump that we typically see in the fourth quarter. Again, we think that was influenced by the two different surges that were ramping down and ramping up. And then the third observation would be then on our inpatient activity. We have seen some migration in inpatient orthopedic surgeries primarily. And outpatient and that did influence the inpatient stat and propped up the outpatient stat somewhat with respect to surgeries. So those will be the three main drivers, I think, of the comparisons. All in all, we did have to manage some capacity in certain situations, again, of the COVID markets. And we're hopeful, again, as we wind down the Omicron variant, that we can get back to some normal period of business. Again, in the 2021, as I've said on our third quarter call, we really haven't had a normal run of what our business trends would be. We've had a holiday variant at the end of 2020 carried into 2021. We had the Delta variant in the middle. We had maybe three to four months where we can - there was no COVID influence of any significance. So we're making some judgments around those variations, but that would be the three level observations we have on the 2019 comparisons. Chris? Well, based on what we know today, there's no reason to presume we can't stay somewhere in that range. But obviously, there is a lot of variables to our business, and we'll have to advance our perspectives on those when we get those variables, I'll say, better understood over the course of this next year and so forth. But that's our thing. We've had a number, Kevin, financial resiliency initiatives, and we have ongoing initiatives that we think are positive to margin, all things equal. But we'll have to wait and see how some of these other components of our business develop over the course of 2022. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. Appreciate it. Thank you, A.J. One of the areas that we're focused on and it's connected really to our labor agenda and it's connected to our overall business agenda for 2022 is managing capacity and throughput most effectively. So case management linked to state management, discharge planning to post-acute in other settings is very important to our success, ER throughput. All of those elements are very important to our ability to manage capacity. And then clearly, we have to execute on our labor agenda, and we have a robust labor agenda to respond to the issues that we face on the people side of our equation. And as it relates to the surges, discharge planning during the surges has been a little bit more difficult. It's been more difficult in the Omicron variant because the nursing home environment and even the home care environment has been suffering from employees who have been infected by the Omicron variant. And so that's created a little bit of a contraction, we think, in some markets with overall post-acute capacity. And that has delayed our ability to execute on our discharge planning process as we ordinarily would. As it pertains, A.J., to our capital planning, as you know, we did acquire the home care and hospice business unit from Brookdale. We have been in the process of integrating that business into our company. And the first part of this year has been about integration. We sold non-overlap components to another home care company, and then we've been organizing ourselves around home care and hospitals inside of the markets where we overlap. And so again, we're in the early stages of integration. We're looking for some significant strides on that front in '22. Additionally, we're making significant investments in rehab, as we've mentioned on these calls in the past, particularly in Florida but also in other components of our business. And we think that will enhance our ability to manage the post-acute discharge process a little bit more efficiently. We also have preferred networks that we've evolved with our bundled payment programs over the years with certain providers in post-acute. We will continue to leverage and build on those relationships, allowing us hopefully to maintain efficient discharge planning process. The last thing I would say on that front as well is our case management program is continuing to be advanced in our company. We are implementing technology. We are deploying certain shared services capabilities around utilization review and so forth. And we think those initiatives are going to yield benefits for us as it relates to capacity management. So a lot of components to this, A.J., overall capital spending, however, to sum it all up here materially changing from what we previously indicated. All right. Thank you, Whit. If you look at COVID in discrete terms, you're probably not incorrect with some of your estimations. But I don't think we're viewing COVID completely discrete in the sense that some of those patients would still be entering the system regardless of COVID, and that was especially true in the fourth quarter as we looked at some of our COVID patients and such that they were coming in for different reasons. And then they were also COVID positive because many people didn't even know they had COVID. So I think you have to sort of look at it as a bit of a mixed bag there and that's how we're judging it as well. I do believe that there was deferred demand, and it still showed itself in the quarter and will yield some recovery in the first part of 2022. I mean, literally, we had surgeons who were closing practices, canceling cases because they themselves contracted the Omicron variant. So I think from that standpoint, there is the typical COVID impact on volumes in the quarter while we're experiencing a surge. But we believe, again, you know, that strong job growth across our portfolio of markets, more people covered by the exchange, deferrals, some elective and transfer closures across our portfolio all bode well for our ability to recover volume in 2022. Again, as I mentioned to A.J., we have to manage capacity. We have to supply that capacity with labor, and we're working through all of those elements as we speak to put ourselves in the best position to receive that demand. We're very excited about the prospects for growth across the company, as I mentioned in my comments. We're investing in that. We've announced, as I mentioned, eight new hospitals, recognized some of the overall growth that exists in these markets. We've had momentum. If you look at our market share at the end of 2019, it was north of 26.5%. It ended with the most recent data that we which is about 1.5 years later, right under 28% so we gained share during COVID. We've positioned our organization, we believe, with our ambulatory network better. And when we bump that up to what we're judging to be some demand that's been dislocated by the COVID surges, we feel like our guidance is reasonable. All right. Thanks, Whit. Operator Your next question is from Sarah James with Barclays. Your line is open. Thank you, Sarah. Well, as Bill mentioned, the market has been significantly disrupted, the labor market that it has been significantly disrupted with COVID. What we see during COVID surges is more opportunities for our nurses and other people's nurses to go into a traveler and get a really outsized rate. We think as COVID surges moderate, that is going to moderate the overall market to some degree. We have advanced our wages for our employees. We've advanced some of our benefits. We've provided certain shift bonuses throughout the year, and that has yielded some increased rate of wage growth for our employee base. We think, however, moving into 2022 as we go through the moderation on the contract labor, we'll be able to absorb the wage trends that are built into our employee base over the course of '22 and land somewhere around 3% to 3.5% possibly on a composite basis for our cost per FTE. And that, we believe, is a something that we can absorb in our guidance. As it relates to our payer contracts, yes, we are talking to them about inflationary pressures and how that will influence future contracting. At this particular point in time, our book-of-business for 2022 is pretty much accomplished and part of '23 is accomplished. But we're building in some flexibility to reflect the inflationary pressures that might exist and we'll continue to work through those as we work through our contract portfolio with the different payers. But I think in general, they understand the pressures that providers are facing on that front, and they have the unique ability to adjust their premiums on an annual basis in most instances. And that should line-up with the need for us to get a fair cost increase related to inflation. All right, Scott. Thanks. Well, I would submit that the eight projects that we've announced is not going to materially change our capital thinking over the next two to three years. We believe we can absorb most of that in what will be a budget that's approximately what we're indicating for, for this year. The situation is this. I mean, some of these markets are growing significantly often. This, as everybody probably knows, is growing in a way that is creating opportunities for us, just like it's creating opportunities for others in that community. But with the growth in that market and with the occupancy that we currently run in Austin, Texas, as an example, it presents a nice platform for us to expand into some of these growing areas and add to our network. Most of these hospitals will be primary and secondary care type hospitals with basic inpatient services and many outpatient services. And then to the extent that these patients need deeper, more acute care, we obviously have those capabilities in or different markets. We have the same situation in Florida with the exception of one hospital that we're building in Fort Myers, which is a new market for us. And we're extending into that market because there's a need for more capacity and it's proximal to one of our west markets in a way that we think we can create synergies. So I think with respect to returns, we have a pattern, we believe of producing very solid projects. It's reflected in our return on capital overall. And we anticipate that these projects over time will yield the same kind of value that we've typically generate with capital programs. So that's where we are with them. Again, most of them are going to be 50 to 75 beds starting out. They're not huge hospitals. They're complementary assets that, over time, will hopefully grow to more acute and more capable facilities with respect to service offerings. All right. Thanks, Gary. I think on the capacity side of the equation, again, if you categorize how we're approaching making sure we have adequate capacity, we have to execute on these categories in order to achieve that. First is staffing. We have to retain the staff we have. We have to recruit new staff, and we have to manage that obviously effectively. And again, we have a number of initiatives in place to deal with that and I'm encouraged by our hiring. We've advanced our recruiting agenda. We've got improvements in certain categories with turnover, and again, getting through COVID surges will be helpful to that. The second thing we're working on is something we're calling new models of care. We're exploring and experimenting with different approaches to staffing models that allow our nurses to be supported by different approaches and creating more capacity, if you will, for our nurse population in a way that delivers the patient outcomes we want and recognize that some of the market issues. And then the final piece is what I had mentioned previously around throughput and capacity management. And again, case management is a piece of that. Telemedicine inside of our hospitals is a piece of that. Load balancing across all of our bed capacity market is a piece of that. So we have a lot of elements of technology also factors into that and how we're using some new technology solutions to help us in throughput management. So those are the areas that we're focused on. And I've got confidence in our teams and our ability to execute around these categories and deliver the capacity that we're going to need in order to take care of the demand that's going to be in the communities. So our total orthopedic volume, surgical volumes were up when you look at inpatient and outpatient in total. We have a physician alignment strategy with our orthopedic community that we think is yielding value. We continue to iterate on that to respond to some of the individual needs from one market to the other. The second piece of our strategy is around our outpatient elements and how we manage our surgical space in the hospitals for outpatient cases, and then also in our ambulatory surgery centers where we have orthopedic partners. So we have a multi-pronged approach to orthopedics, just like we do with most service lines, and it involves our quality agenda, our service agenda, our facility agenda and then our physicians. And so we have the same dynamic with orthopedics. The reimbursement per case is obviously less in an outpatient environment than it is in an inpatient. But I think the important thing about HCA Healthcare is we have such a diversification of services. And no one service provides a disproportionate amount of revenue or profits for the company. So when there's migration from one setting to the other, it doesn't necessarily change the overall equation for the company. And that's what we're seeing with orthopedics today. It's migrating. We've had other service lines over the years migrate from inpatient to outpatient. And we've been able to manage through that and actually create market share momentum around that transition, and we're believing that we have the right approach here with orthopedics as well. Well, I think all of the above on labor. I mean, there's clearly competition for labor, not just in clinical labor, but non-clinical labor, too. The service side of our agenda, we have competitive dynamics on that labor front as well. So we're no different than any other industry when it comes to that. I think, again, we have advanced our recruitment very significantly, and we're recruiting significant numbers of nurses. We have retention efforts that I think are going to pay off. The care transformation that I mentioned in capacity management, all that's connected to a staffing solution for our company. And we're competing very aggressive in this space, just like we compete for physicians, just like we compete for patients and so forth. So I'm confident in our competitive abilities on this particular agenda. Galen is off to a great start. We acquired it, and we're limited to when we could start our expansions. We started our expansion this past year. I think we have 12 new schools in the pipeline, maybe six or eight of them have actually opened, one in Austin and one in Nashville. We're both the fastest ramp-up in new enrollment history of Galen, their CEO told me. So we're very excited about the prospects. It will take us time to graduate these nurses, but we expect to have 12 to 18 new schools over the next two to three years, and that should yield a number of new students for us. We will integrate those students into our facilities in ways that hopefully secure an employment opportunity for them in an HCA facility when they graduate. We anticipate tripling the number of graduates over what they currently produce by 2026, which yield a reasonable growth in number of nurses in the communities that, again, hopefully, we can retain into our facilities. We believe our faculty will be supported by HCA nursing leadership, and the externs programs that we'll use for students in the Galen school will be integrated into HCA procedures, systems and so forth. And we do think that creates some advantage in securing these graduates into our facilities. All right. Thanks, Ben. I don't know what the other companies are necessarily saying about this particular agenda. I think what we're trying to do is make sure we're using technology. We have training and visibility into the processes that make a difference in case management. And then we're ultimately using our capacity broadly across the markets to support better throughput and overall capacity management. And then, as I mentioned, we've advanced our capabilities in post-acute with our own acquisitions and development, as well as relationships with others. And I think the combination of all of those elements create an opportunity for us to gain more efficiencies through our case management programs overall. And we think also that will help us with our receivables and our management of denials and so forth with the payers, and there is some yield on that front as well. So we're pretty excited about the developments in this area. How much more advantage we are than others, I can't really speak to that. Yeah. Well, thank you again for participating on our call, and I wanted to take this moment to thank Mark for his 39 years of service. He and I both have worked 39 years with the company. I'm not sure why he's retiring. But nonetheless, he has had a wonderful career and represented our company incredibly well with our shareholders and others, and I want to thank him for that. And again, welcome, Frank, to the team. Frank's going to do a wonderful job as well. So Mark, congratulations, and we wish you the best."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Chris, thank you so much. Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam and Bill, let me remind everyone that should today\u2019s call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based upon management\u2019s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today\u2019s press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning\u2019s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare is included in today\u2019s release. This morning\u2019s call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sam. Sam?\nSam Hazen: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter was the most intense period yet for us with the COVID pandemic. The Delta variant surged and drove significant demand for our services. For the quarter, COVID patients accounted for 13% of total admissions. This level compares to 3% in the second quarter, 10% in the first quarter and 11% in the fourth quarter of last year. Our teams provided record levels of inpatient care during the quarter, which drove revenue growth of 15% as compared to the prior year. Inpatient revenue grew 18% and outpatient revenue grew 11%. As compared to prior year and also 2019, same-facility volumes increased across all major categories, with the exception of inpatient surgery. Surgery volumes were constrained, because capacity was used for treating COVID patients. This growth was supported by a better payer mix of commercial business. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at over 21%. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, increased to $4.57, which is a notable increase over the prior year. Even considering that last year's third quarter included the $1.72 per share effect of the reversal of the government stimulus income, which as you may recall, resulted from our decision to return or repay early approximately $6 billion of governmental assistance we received from the CARES Act. Once again, our colleagues and physicians delivered for our patients and for our communities. I am tremendously proud of their dedication and service to others, and I want to thank them for their great work. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we have raised our annual earnings guidance again to reflect the strong performance of the company. Now let me transition to some early and general perspectives on the upcoming year. Just like in 2020, we are providing some preliminary thoughts in the midst of a very fluid environment, which obviously makes it challenging, given the uncertainties that continue to exist with the pandemic. We plan to provide more details with our annual guidance in January, after we complete our planning process for 2022. By that time, we hope to have a few more months of results that are more indicative of a normal operating environment that is a non-COVID surge environment to analyze and give you a better indication of our business. Overall, we believe demand will return to historical trends for us, with volumes growing across most categories in the 2% to 3% zone. As part of this growth, we expect to treat COVID patients throughout 2022. We estimate that approximately 3% to 5% of our total admissions will be COVID-related. We believe our business will be supported by a strong payer mix as a result of stable enrollment in the health insurance exchanges and good job growth across our markets. We are also assuming patient acuity continues at high levels. We do expect certain pandemic-related governmental reimbursement programs either will not continue or will continue but at significantly reduced amounts next year. However, we anticipate the reduction of these revenues will be partially offset by certain costs we incurred in treating COVID patients. Clearly, we are operating in a challenging labor environment, which we expect to cause some cost pressures. But at this point in time, we anticipate being able to manage through these challenges along with other inflationary cost pressures. In sum, these assumptions lead us to believe that adjusted EBITDA for 2022 will show modest growth over this year's estimated results. Again, we are providing early perspectives and expectations, and they could change. The past two years have been a remarkable period for HCA Healthcare. We have demonstrated a high level of resiliency and resolve, while at the same time, staying true to our mission. Across many dimensions of our business, we have improved. We have improved our operational and organizational capabilities, which should allow us to provide higher quality care to our patients. I also believe we will emerge on the backside of this event stronger financially and better positioned competitively to grow and drive value for our stakeholders. We are investing aggressively at our operating model, which is to develop a comprehensive and conveniently located local network, coupled with and supported by an enterprise-level system with unique scale and system-level capabilities. We believe this model creates competitive advantage, drives market share gains and produces better outcomes for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Thank you.\nBill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter then review our updated 2021 guidance. Our cash flow from operations was $2.28 billion as compared to $2.7 billion in the third quarter of 2020. In the prior year, we had received approximately $300 million of stimulus income and deferred approximately $200 million of payroll taxes. Capital spending for the quarter was $889 million. And we have approximately $3.9 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online between now and the end of 2023. We completed just over $2.3 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. We have approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our authorization, and we anticipate completing approximately $8 billion of share repurchases for full year 2021. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.55 times at the end of the third quarter, which is the lowest it has been in over 15 years. We had approximately $5.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Also during the quarter, we recorded about $1 billion gain on sale of facilities related to the sale of four hospitals in Georgia and other healthcare entity investments. We anticipate, we will generate approximately $1.5 billion of after-tax proceeds from our announced divestitures. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2021 guidance as follows. We now expect revenues to range between $58.7 billion and $59.3 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.5 billion and $12.8 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.20 and $17.80. And our capital spending target remains at approximately $3.7 billion. As I conclude my remarks, I think it's important to reflect on the financial condition of the company, as we have navigated the past 20 months of this pandemic. The financial resiliency of HCA Healthcare has been on full display during this time. Our organization has emerged stronger today than before we entered this pandemic. With our leverage ratio well below the low end of our stated range of three times, our available liquidity and our continued strong cash flow generation, we are well positioned as we evaluate capital allocation opportunities heading into our planning cycle for 2022. We are focused and committed to delivering long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We look forward to sharing more information with you about our outlook in our year-end call.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to open it up for Q&A.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Sam. Thanks, Bill. Chris, would you give instructions on getting into the queue for questions, please?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]\nMark Kimbrough: I\u2019d like to remind everyone also to try to keep the questions to one, so that we can try to get as many people in the queue as possible.\nOperator: Our first question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Sorry, I\u2019m going to ask for a quick clarification and then the main question. Did you say that 2% to 3% volume growth in total or across most service lines? It sounds like COVID volume might actually be down next year. So I just want to make sure I was hearing that right. But then the main question is really about labor costs. It does seem like labor was higher than we thought this quarter. And then Q4 looks like the margins may be a little bit lower than we thought. Just a little more color on how you're managing labor and what kind of pressure you're seeing there today?\nSam Hazen: I couldn't hear what he said the first question was?\nBill Rutherford: The volume. 2% to 3% on the volume. Was that all-inclusive versus across service lines, certain service lines?\nKevin Fischbeck: Yes. Because COVID is down, right? So...\nBill Rutherford: Yes, we were saying volume\u2026\nKevin Fischbeck: I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019re saying core business up COVID up 2% to 3% and COVID down?\nSam Hazen: We expect COVID volumes to be down. As I said, we are anticipating 3% to 5% of our total admissions will be COVID-related next year. It's about 9%, I think, for this year. So that we do expect some decline in COVID-related, and we hope that happens for our communities and so forth. And so when we estimate at this particular point in time, we're expecting composite volumes across the company as a whole to be up in the 2% to 3% zone over 2020 and over 2019 is really what it boils down to.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Labor?\nSam Hazen: Yes. On labor, let me speak to labor. Obviously, in the third quarter, we were dealing with a very intense COVID surge, with very sick patients. And it was putting a significant strain on our communities and on our facilities and so forth. And we did what we absolutely had to do as a moral imperative to take care of people. And that required us to support that volume and that level of acuity with labor and our labor cost did step up in the third quarter. We used premium pay where we needed to. We used different levels of shift bonuses and overtime where we needed to. But that was not a question to us. We had a lot of people to take care of, and we took care of them appropriately. And we still produced, I think, a very good outcome for the company, with margins at over 21% in the third quarter and actually producing record EBITDA levels. So, labor going forward, we have a multipronged strategy for managing. It starts with expanding our school of nursing, which we think is going to produce a great pipeline of graduate nurses for our company. We anticipate approximately three times the number of graduates coming out of the Galen School of Nursing over the next few years compared to what we do today. The second thing we're working on is recruitment and retention. And we've added tremendous amount of resources to our recruitment functions. We've advanced our benefits in many areas. And we're trying to create an environment where nurses can accomplish what they need to do with our patients and ultimately, have an environment where they can be tremendously successful and discharging their responsibilities to our patients, and at the same time, more productive in doing just nursing care as opposed to non-nursing care. The last thing we're working on that we're very excited about is care transformation. We think we have opportunities with technology and with new models of care and different levels of support that can change the paradigm and how we deliver care on our floors, in our hospitals. And we think the combination of all three of these things put us in a position where we can manage through the environment that we're facing right now. Obviously, there's some unknowns. We're going to have to work our way through those as they present themselves, But we're pretty confident that the company is in a reasonable position to manage through the labor environment.\nMark Kimbrough: Kevin, thank you. Chris, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, good morning.\nSam Hazen: Hey, Ann.\nAnn Hynes: I just want to know how volume tracked by payer mix? Is commercial still outperforming Medicare and Medicaid? And what your expectations are for 2022 when it comes to payer mix? And just one follow-up on your comment about inpatient surgeries being down. If you look at the chart you provided in the press release, they were down 11.2% versus 2019. Do you think that's all COVID-related, or is there something else happening sequentially? Thanks. \nSam Hazen: All right, Ann.\nBill Rutherford: Ann, let me start with the payer mix. Our payer mix, I think, as Sam alluded to in his comments, remains favorable with our managed care and others growing probably 12% to 14% over the prior year. Our Medicare showed growth, but not quite at that level. We were 2% to 3% on Medicare. On whether we look at 2019, very similar trends. So, we continue to expect favorable payer mix trends going forward.\nSam Hazen: And with respect to labor - or surgery in the third quarter, as I mentioned in my comments, we constrained surgery out of need for other patient care requirements. So, we used our surgical staff in many instances to support COVID patients across our facilities. Number one, we had to use physical space in our recovery rooms at times to take care of people. And so from that standpoint, we did reduce elective care during the quarter at many of our hospitals. And we reduced transfers in that typically result in surgeries of some sort in many instances. We do think that, that volume will recover as it's recovered in previous periods where we had to do the same thing, second quarter to first quarter, as an example. So we anticipate recovery in that. And so from that standpoint, we are working our way through reopening surgery capacity across the company in an appropriate fashion. And we really don't see any structural issues with our surgical activity across the company.\nMark Kimbrough: Thank you, Ann.\nAnn Hynes: Thanks.\nMark Kimbrough: Chris?\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, and congrats to you guys on the quarter. I guess my question, as it relates to the guidance, it's sort of unusual for you to see a sequential decline in EBITDA from Q3 to Q4, which is what's implied by the midpoint of the 2021 guidance. So just wondering if that's just conservatism. And then as I think about the 2022 commentary, 2% to 3% volume, how are you thinking just about margin trend with labor in the background? Should we expect flat margins to translate to kind of like a 2% to 3% EBITDA growth rate as well?\nSam Hazen: Yes. Brian, let me start with the fourth quarter guidance. We think our range provides some level of growth, and we recognize at the midpoint, then there's still a lot of variables at play. We'll continue to manage the company the best we can to continue to drive growth. We've had very few normal months to project from. But we - again, I think our range is appropriate at this level. It's roughly a $350 million raise at the midpoint compared to our previous guidance. So, again, I think it's appropriate from how we read it right now.\nMark Kimbrough: Margin. I think he asked also about the margins.\nSam Hazen: Well, there's going to be a lot of variables that play into margins for next year. As we conclude our planning, we'll talk to you further about those. But I think we have a history to continue to drive reasonable margins going forward, and that's our expectation to be able to continue to do that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. A couple of things here. Just wanted to clarify, when you - given that historically, the typical EBITDA growth of the company is in the mid-single digits, when you say modest, is it fair to take lower single-digits there kind of as a jump-off point for 2022? And then my question is on labor. Can you give us a little color on two things? One, any kind of help on the - maybe the dollar amount and the percentage kind of temporary labor, travel labor that you're kind of running? I know - given it\u2019s such high cost, it would be great on the revenue side, or I should say the cost side as well. And then, can you walk us through kind of how your labor costs are run through the year in terms of maybe what percentage of your labor kind of gets repriced to get their increases quarterly, because I know it's not all just 1:1? Thanks.\nMark Kimbrough: You snuck three questions in - on one call but...\nBill Rutherford: Justin, this is Bill. Let me start with kind of 2022. We - our intention was to provide some broad commentary, not really ready to go into a lot of details. But as we've mentioned throughout the course of the year, we know we've received some COVID support from the DRG add-on payments, HRSA payments for uninsured, COBRA payments, as well as the delay of sequestration cuts. These programs, they contribute about $625 million year-to-date. They could reach close to $750 million, $800 million for the full year. We don't have full line of sight now on what to expect for these programs going forward. We hope to have some clear assessment of these as we complete the planning process. But for now, we're not really expecting those to continue to benefit going into 2022. However, we also have some COVID-related costs this year that we don't expect to continue going forward; supply-related costs, cost of screeners and alike. So our broad thinking now is we should reasonably expect to be able to generate our historical growth rate of 5% to 6% after netting out these amounts. And that is what the result -- will result in some modest growth year-over-year on an as-reported basis. So that was kind of our broad thinking right now. We'll firm that up as we go through our planning cycle. But that was the intention of our commentary to show that we still see some growth going forward in 2022.\nSam Hazen: And with respect to labor, again, we used whatever labor we could find to take care of record census that the company was experiencing with the Delta variant surge. So we used contract labor over time. Again, bonuses for our full-time staff, whatever it took to staff to the patient load that we had. And that resulted in about 10% to 12% of our FTEs being in those premium pay categories. That obviously trends down naturally as we have a less COVID census. We've had that pattern in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year. And we expect that pattern to continue.  As it relates to the wage rates and the changes that we have, they vary across the company. Generally speaking, they're in -- mostly in the second quarter and third quarter. So that's part of the natural trend that we see inside of our labor costs as we move through the course of the year. One thing, and Bill was alluding to this, typically, we have fourth quarter seasonality that generates more activity in the fourth quarter than we have in the third quarter. We don't have a baseline third quarter to judge seasonality right now, and that's part of the challenge that we've got. But I think the company has proven that it can manage in a surge very effectively and produce really solid margins. And then in a reboot, like we did in the second quarter, managed through that transition in a very effective way. So I fully anticipate that our teams will be able to navigate through the back part of the third quarter, into the fourth quarter and on into next year, and hopefully, a reboot mode in a way that ultimately produces success for the company.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Interested if you could talk a bit about what you're seeing in Medicaid volumes. And just been interesting too, it seems like Medicaid volumes have continued to trend relatively low in terms of the overall mix even though Medicaid enrollments are just up so much because of the suspension of the redetermination. So just interested in your perspective on what you're thinking around that aspect, in terms of the lower Medicaid vaults relative to the increases in Medicaid enrollment growth. Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Great. Thanks, Scott.\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Scott. I'll try. We did see Medicaid growth when I look at 2021 versus 2020 of almost 9%, I don't have at my fingertips what Medicaid enrollment has done in our states. So I don't have that as a relative base. But we have seen Medicaid growth in this quarter at least. Year-to-date, we're tracking at about 7%. So perhaps that does track with enrollment going forward as well.\nOperator: The next question is from Ralph Giacobbe. Your line is open.\nRalph Giacobbe: I guess, first, you gave -- and I know you want to sort of hold off on full guidance. But you gave us the volume up 2% to 3%. Hoping you can give some sense on how you see the pricing stat developing next year? And then specifically, just on the acuity mix, obviously another strong quarter there. Is there any way to exclude COVID out and give us a sense of what that is, sort of either year-over-year or relative to 2019? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Hi Rob. Thanks. Well, as I said -- this is Sam. We do anticipate that acuity levels will be strong as we move forward into 2022. Our COVID -- our non-COVID acuity levels for the year have been up compared to 2019. And so we have seen a natural lift in acuity. Part of that is strategic. Part of that is some migration into outpatient. And part of that is just sort of the environment that we're in, we believe. So we anticipate that acuity levels will remain strong. I don't know that we've assigned a metric to it at this particular point in time. But if you look at our non-COVID activity for the year as a whole, it is up compared to 2019. And so we anticipate that, at this particular juncture, continuing into 2022.\nOperator: Our next question is from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nFrank Morgan: Just curious on the surgery side. Any additional color you could provide to us on a regional basis between in and outpatient and freestanding surgical volumes and where you saw the biggest impact for COVID? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Well, our inpatient surgeries were the only metric, again, as I mentioned in my comments that were down for the quarter. And that's because we used a lot of the space that was necessary for COVID patients. Our outpatient activity was up. It was up 7%. It was up more in our freestanding ASCs than it was in our hospitals, but both were up. And then when you look at it against 2019, I think, again, we had growth, with the exception of inpatient surgery freight. And that, again, is a direct correlation to the fact that we needed that space for COVID inpatients in order to manage our capacity from both staffing and a bed standpoint.\nFrank Morgan: And just in the -- just from a geographic standpoint, on the outpatient side, did you notice any more of an effect in, say, the Texas and Florida markets, say, an outpatient because of COVID? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: I don't have all of it in front of me. Obviously, Florida and Texas were very intense geographies for us with the Delta variant. And so it's reasonable to assume that that's where we had more pressure in those markets than we did in other parts of the country. But that would be my reaction to that question, Frank.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Thanks for taking my questions. For your 2022 revenue commentary, you talked about the Kai -- acuity procedures continuing. Just curious sort of what is fueling that? What areas are driving that? Is it cardio recovering, orthopedics, etcetera? And then as I think about 2022 and beyond, just a question for you, once you get over sort of the noise from COVID, does your long-term EBITDA growth that you've laid out in the past, does it still of continue from these levels once you get through the noise of '21 and 2022? Thanks so much. \nSam Hazen: Thanks. Our belief is that demand for health care services is still strong. We think it's going to be 1.5% to 2% when you look out into the intermediate run and so forth. And we think for HCA, we have a differentiated portfolio of markets. And we have strong economies underneath that differentiated portfolio, where population growth, job growth and so forth is existent. And then we've had this pattern and we think this pattern can continue of market share gains. And as we look at where we are today versus where we were heading into 2020, we think we've improved our overall positioning competitively with the broader networks, more physicians, better clinical outcomes and so forth. And we will continue to resource our model. And we think that model still has growth embedded in it because of these factors. And we're not ready to give any particular guidance as it relates to out years. But we do think the company's approach can still yield successful return for our shareholders.\nOperator: The next question is from Whit Mayo with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. \nWhit Mayo: As I sort of reflect back on commentary a year ago, Sam, you referenced a lot of I guess, we'll call it emerging pop-up growth opportunities. I sort of think the ability to align closer to certain medical groups comes to mind. It might just be helpful to hear how some of these opportunities have evolved over the last 18 months. And maybe I mean this in the context of market share shifts, etcetera. But just any high-level observations or thoughts would be helpful? Thanks. \nSam Hazen: Thank you, Whit. Well, let me start with the fact that our most recent market share data that we have, which is late last year, 2020 or first part of this year, I don't remember the exact period, shows us at a high watermark. We picked up market share in 2020 when I look at just sort of what happened in that year. So, I'll start with that. Additionally, we have added to our networks. We have added, in some cases, a few hospitals here and there, whether it's new hospitals that have opened or we've had small acquisitions of hospitals to round out our network offering. But in particular, on the outpatient side, we've added a reasonable number of new facilities, whether it's new urgent care center platform, new freestanding emergency rooms, some ambulatory surgery. And then we've added to our physician platform over the last 18 months. Some of which has been development of existing practices in our communities, but also new practice acquisitions that have added to our offerings. I think our outpatient facility capability is up to about 2,200 outpatient facilities. At the end of 2019, it was just a little north of 2,000. So we continue to add capabilities and convenience for our patients, again, creating a broader network offering in these communities. We have done some acquisitions. Our pipeline as it relates to outpatient acquisitions is strong. Also, our development pipeline of new outpatient facilities is robust, and we fueled that with investment. And then as Bill indicated, we have a strong pipeline of projects that will come online in 2022 and 2023 that are connected to both our hospital platform as well as our outpatient platform. So, we see, again, the model, the flywheel, if you will, of HCA continuing to produce solid results and deliver value to our patients and value to our shareholders.\nOperator: The next question is from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, I just wanted to follow up on the capital deployment theme. And if you could talk a little bit about what you're looking at as far as enterprise assets that sit atop the local markets. And in particular, earlier in the year, you were talking about the flywheel concept and looking at digital or virtual assets or other sorts of assets that might feed into it. But just interesting if you had any evolution and thought as to what you're going to be focused on there and then if there's any progress reports on that? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: All right. Thank you, Lance. We do see complementary opportunities to use digital capabilities more effectively in our company. As I've mentioned on previous calls, advancing technology in our organization is a tremendous opportunity to improve care, support our physicians and nurses with decision-making capabilities as well as a more safe environment. We also see with that more consistency and transparency, which we believe can produce more efficiencies as we go through it. So, we've got a number of initiatives that are connected to that. In addition to that component, we are using telemedicine to support outreach to our patient population, and meet them where they want to be. And then we see opportunities for telemedicine to support what goes on inside of our facilities and preserve better care for our patients by helping our physicians and our nurses with really extended capabilities that can come from telemedicine inside the walls of our hospitals. So, those areas are progressing. They're showing early signs of value in some instances. And then when they connect with our care transformation agenda, which is being led by one of our physicians and his team, we're very excited about what that potentially yields in the form of better care, more efficient care and so forth. So, we have a number of initiatives underway. They're not completely implemented across the company because we're still studying what are the best approaches. But we're pretty excited about what this agenda can do for our organization.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJamie Perse: Good morning guys. thanks for the question. Early in the pandemic, you outlined a couple of different phases of cost opportunities that you were thinking about. How are those tracking? And how much more of the base cost structure can you optimize? And are those enough to offset some of the incremental wage pressures you're dealing with and other inflationary pressures out there?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. Thanks for the question. As we have talked about before, we have resiliency efforts underway. We started last year. Those efforts continue. We have some of those efforts that are implemented and we're realizing the benefits now. And we have some of those efforts that are still in the early stages of implementation that will provide benefit going to the future. We do expect some of those areas to help offset some of the inflationary increases we might see. These efforts are centered around utilizing our scale, where we have the ability to consolidate and standardize functions that may be distributed right now. They're also looking at some structural changes in terms of how we support our field-based operations. So we have a number of efforts underway. Some of them are at the completion stage, and the benefits are being realized as we speak. And some of them still are in the early stages that will provide benefit going forward. So it's an important part of our activity level right now. We have teams focused on a variety of efforts. And we have a certain governance structure in place to make sure that they get executed timely. So they will continue going forward.\nOperator: The next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody. And Mark I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to have you on the fourth quarter call, so I just would say, congratulations on your retirement and best wishes. I want to ask about the capital deployment a little further. Obviously, this year, you did $6 billion. You're on \u2013 you've done $6 billion of share repurchases. When you think about capital deployment going forward, what kind of pace do you think is reasonable for that? And I know you've already announced the Salt Lake City deal. So on the side of coming out of the pandemic, hospital assets or other more significant assets that might be available, can you talk about that pipeline? And specifically with Salt Lake, when you made your comments, Bill, about next year's growth, I'm assuming, until that deal closes, you're not incorporating that in your commentary. My understanding it's about $90 million to $100 million of EBITDA.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. A.J., you are correct. We are not incorporating anything into that into our commentary at this point in time. Relating to the capital allocation, let me step back and talk a little broadly about that. As I mentioned in my comments, we are in a very strong position as we approach our capital allocation decisions for next year given our cash flow generation, the balance sheet position and liquidity we're carrying. As we've described in the past, we're really focused on what I described as a balanced approach to capital, with our first priority is evaluating opportunity to deploy capital in our markets to capture growth through our internal capital program. We haven\u2019t finalized on that range yet, but I would anticipate we'll increase it commensurate with the opportunity. So we mentioned in our guidance, it should be somewhere around $3.7 billion this year, maybe a little below that. Prior to the pandemic, we were at $4 billion to $4.2 billion. And so we're evaluating where that should settle for next year. But we think that will be an important part of the continuing our growth. After that, it's a matter of how best to utilize our free cash flow to drive value. A dividend program and share repurchase program, we expect to continue to be an important part of our overall capital allocation process. We haven't finalized that. But we have ample capital capacity to give due consideration to both of those programs. And I would expect them to be part of our balanced portfolio of capital going forward.\nOperator: The next question is from John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJohn Ransom: Good morning. I'd add my best wishes to Mr. Kimbrough.\nSam Hazen: He's not leaving yet. We still got him for a little while, but\u2026\nMark Kimbrough: I'll be here for the year-end. Yeah. I get to\u2026\nJohn Ransom: I'm thinking of spelunking or ballroom dancing something. I think you need to take an eccentric hobby.\nMark Kimbrough: That's right.\nJohn Ransom: Just thinking about fourth quarter in conjunction with your guidance, I mean, your labor costs, you talked about it a lot, but they jumped up about 11% after kind of hanging in, in the $640 million range for three quarters. If we think about the fourth quarter, let's say COVID dropped from \u2013 drops by 5%, 6%, and so some of that pressure comes off, isn't it reasonable to think that the labor costs get a little bit of a breather sequentially just relative to less acute pressure from what we saw at the Delta wave at the peak in, say, August?\nBill Rutherford: Yeah, John. This is Bill. I think as Sam mentioned in his earlier commentary, we \u2013 this quarter was affected by having and gaining the labor at any way we could to support the volume we were seeing. And as COVID does subside, we expect those premium programs that we implemented during the quarter to subside. And then whether it be the utilization of the contract labor, looking at the overtime as well as some of these bonus shift differentials that we had to pay. So we do expect that to come down relative to where we had in third quarter. But we understand there's still pressure in the labor market. So we'll just have to see where that settles out for the fourth quarter.\nJohn Ransom: So I mean, just as a follow-up. So if I think about flat sequential revenue and less acute pressure from labor wouldn't that imply EBITDA going up sequentially, not being flat?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. I understand that question. As we said before, historically, we see some seasonality. We don't know what the seasonality change will be. We think our range provides the opportunity for us to grow at the top end of that. So again, I think just given the environment we're seeing, we're prudent in our range, and that's what we're going with at this point.\nOperator: The next question is from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I'm going to hold my comments on Mark, then I guess, for another 90 days to till we get them for the 4Q. My question is on value-based care. From the perspective that HCA is the largest hospital operator in the country, one of the largest employers of physicians in the country, so do you look at this movement? And it doesn't feel like it's being felt much at the facility level. But do you think there are opportunities for HCA on the hospital side to benefit from value-based care contracts? And then how do you think about opportunities for your physician base? Because I know there's a ton of conversation around enabling providers at this point?\nSam Hazen: Well, we have certain aspects of value-based care embedded in, obviously, Medicare reimbursement. In some of our commercial contracts, we have aspects of value-based care component as part of our reimbursement methodologies. That will continue, I think, into the future. Is it accelerating in our facility structures? No. Inside of our physician platform, we do see opportunities to continue to push further into value-based care. Again, in that particular platform in our company, we have aspects of value-based care. They vary a little bit from one market to the other depending on the circumstances and the demographics and payer dynamics in those markets. So we do see it growing more in the physician platform than on the facility side, I would submit. But I think if you pull up, and you look at our relationships across the organization in the payer environment, they're very strong. We're 80%, 85% contracted for 2022. We're about 50% contracted for 2023 on terms that work for both organizations. They continue a lot of the structure that's already in place. And we evolve, as we renew with what's going on in the marketplace. We are in most commercial contracts in just about every market, where we do business. And in most Medicare Advantage relationships as well. So that's a key part of our approach. And that's why it's important for our model within each of the markets to be comprehensive, both in outpatient offerings, convenient for the patients. And then, having different price points for the payers, but ultimately creating a full system that can offer solutions. And we adjust those solutions to fit the situation with each payer. And some of that, again, can be value based. Some of it can be a different approach as to other reimbursement terms. But we think we're striking the right balance in how we approach that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Good morning guys. Congrats on the quarter. I know it was a very difficult one to manage through. And The Street is always immediately looking for the next data point, maybe not enough credit given, when it's due. So good job on the quarter, I wanted to ask,\u2026\nBill Rutherford: Thank you Gary.\nGary Taylor: \u2026I wanted to ask, I think this primarily goes to Bill. When we look at where your margins were trending a few years pre-pandemic, up a couple of hundred basis points, I think your guidance for next year inherently assumes, margins come back to some degree. And we understand all the factors that have been driving it. The higher occupancy, the better mix, the higher acuity, despite the COVID cost, despite the labor costs, et cetera. But Bill, I feel like a year or so ago, you did talk about some opportunities to take some real sort of permanent efficiencies out of the cost structure. And just wanted to get your thoughts now as we sort of head into 2022 and beyond, should investors think that margins ultimately just go right back to the low-19s? Or are there good reasons structurally to think that maybe you can sustain somewhere in the middle?\nBill Rutherford: Well, Gary, one, thanks. It is a very good question. Assure, we are focused on driving as much efficiency as we can throughout the organization. I think we have a pretty good track record of doing that. You're right. If you go pre-pandemic, we were hovering 19% margins. There are a couple of quarters we'd be in 20%. We've step changed that. Some of that is due to the mix and acuity on there. Our focus will be to continue to drive margins. We have been supported by a couple of those COVID support programs that I spoke about. We fully anticipate once we account for those, that we should maintain and find some resiliency plans and our day-to-day management, is continue to drive efficiencies, utilize the scale of the organization to bring benefits. So I do believe that once we get into a normalized kind of post-COVID surge environment and we compare our current margins to where they were pre-pandemic, you'll see some elevation in there.\nMark Kimbrough: Thank you, Gary.\nGary Taylor: Yeah. Thanks.\nSamHazen: Yeah, So when you look at the -- Gary, this is Sam. When you look at the third quarter of 2019, we cleared almost, what I call, 36% of EBITDA clearance. In other words, our margins in 2021 against 2019 were two times what the average margin was in 2019. And so obviously, it's significant compared to that same period then and we do see some structural pieces that Bill was alluding to. Obviously, there's a potential of inflation that we have to figure out exactly what the implications of that are. And we think some of our strategies will mitigate it. But we have been able to reposition the profitability of the company. And we're pushing to try to sustain those gains as much as we possibly can.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Mok with UBS Financial. Your line is open.\nAndrew Mok: Good morning. First, one clarification, then, I'll get to my question. Bill, earlier, I think you said 5% to 6% core EBITDA growth off of the earnings base ex-government aid. If so, it sounds like you actually expect accelerating growth in 2022, compared to the long-term growth target of 4% to 6%. Is that fair?\nBill Rutherford: Well, we have had long-term 4% to 6%. I think if you look at our actual historical, we'd be more in that 5% to 6%. So again, we're in early stages. And the intent was to give you some broad commentary versus specifics on there. So that was how the commentary was structured.\nAndrew Mok: And then just a follow-up on the de novo deployment. I think you have at least 20 to 30 de novos underway between ambulatory surgery and inpatient rehab. Can you give us a sense for the cadence of when those facilities come online and the expected profit ramp of those facilities over the next 18 months?\nSam Hazen: I don't have -- I mean we have a pipeline of urgent care that I know is coming online in 2022 or 2023, again through acquisition or de novo development. We have maybe 10 or 12 ambulatory surgery centers. Some of which come online in the fourth quarter, some -- most come online in 2022 of that particular component. And then we have some other outpatient facilities that -- maybe 15 or so, and those categories come online in 2022, with another 15 or so in 2023. So we have a lot in different categories coming online. And that's part of the continued addition to our 2,200 outpatient facilities. And so I don't have the earnings expectations around those or a composite on each -- all of them in total. We -- but we do have a pretty active development. And those are complementary. And there's a natural ramp in them as well. And for the most part, we're really bullish on the prospects for those outpatient facilities.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call over to Mr. Kimbrough for any closing remarks.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Chris, thank you so much for your help today. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call. I hope you have a wonderful weekend. I'm around this afternoon, if I can answer any additional questions you might have. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter then review our updated 2021 guidance. Our cash flow from operations was $2.28 billion as compared to $2.7 billion in the third quarter of 2020. In the prior year, we had received approximately $300 million of stimulus income and deferred approximately $200 million of payroll taxes. Capital spending for the quarter was $889 million. And we have approximately $3.9 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online between now and the end of 2023. We completed just over $2.3 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. We have approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our authorization, and we anticipate completing approximately $8 billion of share repurchases for full year 2021. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.55 times at the end of the third quarter, which is the lowest it has been in over 15 years. We had approximately $5.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Also during the quarter, we recorded about $1 billion gain on sale of facilities related to the sale of four hospitals in Georgia and other healthcare entity investments. We anticipate, we will generate approximately $1.5 billion of after-tax proceeds from our announced divestitures. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2021 guidance as follows. We now expect revenues to range between $58.7 billion and $59.3 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.5 billion and $12.8 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.20 and $17.80. And our capital spending target remains at approximately $3.7 billion. As I conclude my remarks, I think it's important to reflect on the financial condition of the company, as we have navigated the past 20 months of this pandemic. The financial resiliency of HCA Healthcare has been on full display during this time. Our organization has emerged stronger today than before we entered this pandemic. With our leverage ratio well below the low end of our stated range of three times, our available liquidity and our continued strong cash flow generation, we are well positioned as we evaluate capital allocation opportunities heading into our planning cycle for 2022. We are focused and committed to delivering long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We look forward to sharing more information with you about our outlook in our year-end call.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to open it up for Q&A. The volume. 2% to 3% on the volume. Was that all-inclusive versus across service lines, certain service lines? Yes, we were saying volume... Yes. Labor? Ann, let me start with the payer mix. Our payer mix, I think, as Sam alluded to in his comments, remains favorable with our managed care and others growing probably 12% to 14% over the prior year. Our Medicare showed growth, but not quite at that level. We were 2% to 3% on Medicare. On whether we look at 2019, very similar trends. So, we continue to expect favorable payer mix trends going forward. Justin, this is Bill. Let me start with kind of 2022. We - our intention was to provide some broad commentary, not really ready to go into a lot of details. But as we've mentioned throughout the course of the year, we know we've received some COVID support from the DRG add-on payments, HRSA payments for uninsured, COBRA payments, as well as the delay of sequestration cuts. These programs, they contribute about $625 million year-to-date. They could reach close to $750 million, $800 million for the full year. We don't have full line of sight now on what to expect for these programs going forward. We hope to have some clear assessment of these as we complete the planning process. But for now, we're not really expecting those to continue to benefit going into 2022. However, we also have some COVID-related costs this year that we don't expect to continue going forward; supply-related costs, cost of screeners and alike. So our broad thinking now is we should reasonably expect to be able to generate our historical growth rate of 5% to 6% after netting out these amounts. And that is what the result -- will result in some modest growth year-over-year on an as-reported basis. So that was kind of our broad thinking right now. We'll firm that up as we go through our planning cycle. But that was the intention of our commentary to show that we still see some growth going forward in 2022. Yes, Scott. I'll try. We did see Medicaid growth when I look at 2021 versus 2020 of almost 9%, I don't have at my fingertips what Medicaid enrollment has done in our states. So I don't have that as a relative base. But we have seen Medicaid growth in this quarter at least. Year-to-date, we're tracking at about 7%. So perhaps that does track with enrollment going forward as well. Yes. This is Bill. Thanks for the question. As we have talked about before, we have resiliency efforts underway. We started last year. Those efforts continue. We have some of those efforts that are implemented and we're realizing the benefits now. And we have some of those efforts that are still in the early stages of implementation that will provide benefit going to the future. We do expect some of those areas to help offset some of the inflationary increases we might see. These efforts are centered around utilizing our scale, where we have the ability to consolidate and standardize functions that may be distributed right now. They're also looking at some structural changes in terms of how we support our field-based operations. So we have a number of efforts underway. Some of them are at the completion stage, and the benefits are being realized as we speak. And some of them still are in the early stages that will provide benefit going forward. So it's an important part of our activity level right now. We have teams focused on a variety of efforts. And we have a certain governance structure in place to make sure that they get executed timely. So they will continue going forward. Yes. A.J., you are correct. We are not incorporating anything into that into our commentary at this point in time. Relating to the capital allocation, let me step back and talk a little broadly about that. As I mentioned in my comments, we are in a very strong position as we approach our capital allocation decisions for next year given our cash flow generation, the balance sheet position and liquidity we're carrying.

A dividend program and share repurchase program, we expect to continue to be an important part of our overall capital allocation process. We haven't finalized that. But we have ample capital capacity to give due consideration to both of those programs. And I would expect them to be part of our balanced portfolio of capital going forward. Yeah, John. This is Bill. I think as Sam mentioned in his earlier commentary, we \u2013 this quarter was affected by having and gaining the labor at any way we could to support the volume we were seeing.

So we'll just have to see where that settles out for the fourth quarter. Yes. I understand that question. As we said before, historically, we see some seasonality. We don't know what the seasonality change will be. We think our range provides the opportunity for us to grow at the top end of that. So again, I think just given the environment we're seeing, we're prudent in our range, and that's what we're going with at this point. Thank you Gary. Well, Gary, one, thanks. It is a very good question. Assure, we are focused on driving as much efficiency as we can throughout the organization. I think we have a pretty good track record of doing that. You're right. If you go pre-pandemic, we were hovering 19% margins. There are a couple of quarters we'd be in 20%. We've step changed that. Some of that is due to the mix and acuity on there.

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter was the most intense period yet for us with the COVID pandemic. The Delta variant surged and drove significant demand for our services. For the quarter, COVID patients accounted for 13% of total admissions. This level compares to 3% in the second quarter, 10% in the first quarter and 11% in the fourth quarter of last year. Our teams provided record levels of inpatient care during the quarter, which drove revenue growth of 15% as compared to the prior year. Inpatient revenue grew 18% and outpatient revenue grew 11%. As compared to prior year and also 2019, same-facility volumes increased across all major categories, with the exception of inpatient surgery. Surgery volumes were constrained, because capacity was used for treating COVID patients. This growth was supported by a better payer mix of commercial business. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at over 21%. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, increased to $4.57, which is a notable increase over the prior year. Even considering that last year's third quarter included the $1.72 per share effect of the reversal of the government stimulus income, which as you may recall, resulted from our decision to return or repay early approximately $6 billion of governmental assistance we received from the CARES Act. Once again, our colleagues and physicians delivered for our patients and for our communities. I am tremendously proud of their dedication and service to others, and I want to thank them for their great work. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we have raised our annual earnings guidance again to reflect the strong performance of the company. Now let me transition to some early and general perspectives on the upcoming year. Just like in 2020, we are providing some preliminary thoughts in the midst of a very fluid environment, which obviously makes it challenging, given the uncertainties that continue to exist with the pandemic. We plan to provide more details with our annual guidance in January, after we complete our planning process for 2022. By that time, we hope to have a few more months of results that are more indicative of a normal operating environment that is a non-COVID surge environment to analyze and give you a better indication of our business. Overall, we believe demand will return to historical trends for us, with volumes growing across most categories in the 2% to 3% zone. As part of this growth, we expect to treat COVID patients throughout 2022. We estimate that approximately 3% to 5% of our total admissions will be COVID-related. We believe our business will be supported by a strong payer mix as a result of stable enrollment in the health insurance exchanges and good job growth across our markets. We are also assuming patient acuity continues at high levels. We do expect certain pandemic-related governmental reimbursement programs either will not continue or will continue but at significantly reduced amounts next year. However, we anticipate the reduction of these revenues will be partially offset by certain costs we incurred in treating COVID patients. Clearly, we are operating in a challenging labor environment, which we expect to cause some cost pressures. But at this point in time, we anticipate being able to manage through these challenges along with other inflationary cost pressures. In sum, these assumptions lead us to believe that adjusted EBITDA for 2022 will show modest growth over this year's estimated results. Again, we are providing early perspectives and expectations, and they could change. The past two years have been a remarkable period for HCA Healthcare. We have demonstrated a high level of resiliency and resolve, while at the same time, staying true to our mission. Across many dimensions of our business, we have improved. We have improved our operational and organizational capabilities, which should allow us to provide higher quality care to our patients. I also believe we will emerge on the backside of this event stronger financially and better positioned competitively to grow and drive value for our stakeholders. We are investing aggressively at our operating model, which is to develop a comprehensive and conveniently located local network, coupled with and supported by an enterprise-level system with unique scale and system-level capabilities. We believe this model creates competitive advantage, drives market share gains and produces better outcomes for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Thank you. I couldn't hear what he said the first question was? We expect COVID volumes to be down. As I said, we are anticipating 3% to 5% of our total admissions will be COVID-related next year. It's about 9%, I think, for this year. So that we do expect some decline in COVID-related, and we hope that happens for our communities and so forth. And so when we estimate at this particular point in time, we're expecting composite volumes across the company as a whole to be up in the 2% to 3% zone over 2020 and over 2019 is really what it boils down to. Yes. On labor, let me speak to labor. Obviously, in the third quarter, we were dealing with a very intense COVID surge, with very sick patients. And it was putting a significant strain on our communities and on our facilities and so forth. And we did what we absolutely had to do as a moral imperative to take care of people. And that required us to support that volume and that level of acuity with labor and our labor cost did step up in the third quarter. We used premium pay where we needed to. We used different levels of shift bonuses and overtime where we needed to. But that was not a question to us. We had a lot of people to take care of, and we took care of them appropriately. And we still produced, I think, a very good outcome for the company, with margins at over 21% in the third quarter and actually producing record EBITDA levels. So, labor going forward, we have a multipronged strategy for managing. It starts with expanding our school of nursing, which we think is going to produce a great pipeline of graduate nurses for our company. We anticipate approximately three times the number of graduates coming out of the Galen School of Nursing over the next few years compared to what we do today. The second thing we're working on is recruitment and retention. And we've added tremendous amount of resources to our recruitment functions. We've advanced our benefits in many areas. And we're trying to create an environment where nurses can accomplish what they need to do with our patients and ultimately, have an environment where they can be tremendously successful and discharging their responsibilities to our patients, and at the same time, more productive in doing just nursing care as opposed to non-nursing care. The last thing we're working on that we're very excited about is care transformation. We think we have opportunities with technology and with new models of care and different levels of support that can change the paradigm and how we deliver care on our floors, in our hospitals. And we think the combination of all three of these things put us in a position where we can manage through the environment that we're facing right now. Obviously, there's some unknowns. We're going to have to work our way through those as they present themselves, But we're pretty confident that the company is in a reasonable position to manage through the labor environment. Hey, Ann. All right, Ann. And with respect to labor - or surgery in the third quarter, as I mentioned in my comments, we constrained surgery out of need for other patient care requirements. So, we used our surgical staff in many instances to support COVID patients across our facilities. Number one, we had to use physical space in our recovery rooms at times to take care of people. And so from that standpoint, we did reduce elective care during the quarter at many of our hospitals. And we reduced transfers in that typically result in surgeries of some sort in many instances. We do think that, that volume will recover as it's recovered in previous periods where we had to do the same thing, second quarter to first quarter, as an example. So we anticipate recovery in that. And so from that standpoint, we are working our way through reopening surgery capacity across the company in an appropriate fashion. And we really don't see any structural issues with our surgical activity across the company. Yes. Brian, let me start with the fourth quarter guidance. We think our range provides some level of growth, and we recognize at the midpoint, then there's still a lot of variables at play. We'll continue to manage the company the best we can to continue to drive growth. We've had very few normal months to project from. But we - again, I think our range is appropriate at this level. It's roughly a $350 million raise at the midpoint compared to our previous guidance. So, again, I think it's appropriate from how we read it right now. Well, there's going to be a lot of variables that play into margins for next year. As we conclude our planning, we'll talk to you further about those. But I think we have a history to continue to drive reasonable margins going forward, and that's our expectation to be able to continue to do that. And with respect to labor, again, we used whatever labor we could find to take care of record census that the company was experiencing with the Delta variant surge. So we used contract labor over time. Again, bonuses for our full-time staff, whatever it took to staff to the patient load that we had. And that resulted in about 10% to 12% of our FTEs being in those premium pay categories. That obviously trends down naturally as we have a less COVID census. We've had that pattern in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year. And we expect that pattern to continue.  As it relates to the wage rates and the changes that we have, they vary across the company. Generally speaking, they're in -- mostly in the second quarter and third quarter. So that's part of the natural trend that we see inside of our labor costs as we move through the course of the year. One thing, and Bill was alluding to this, typically, we have fourth quarter seasonality that generates more activity in the fourth quarter than we have in the third quarter. We don't have a baseline third quarter to judge seasonality right now, and that's part of the challenge that we've got. But I think the company has proven that it can manage in a surge very effectively and produce really solid margins. And then in a reboot, like we did in the second quarter, managed through that transition in a very effective way. So I fully anticipate that our teams will be able to navigate through the back part of the third quarter, into the fourth quarter and on into next year, and hopefully, a reboot mode in a way that ultimately produces success for the company. Great. Thanks, Scott. Hi Rob. Thanks. Well, as I said -- this is Sam. We do anticipate that acuity levels will be strong as we move forward into 2022. Our COVID -- our non-COVID acuity levels for the year have been up compared to 2019. And so we have seen a natural lift in acuity. Part of that is strategic. Part of that is some migration into outpatient. And part of that is just sort of the environment that we're in, we believe. So we anticipate that acuity levels will remain strong. I don't know that we've assigned a metric to it at this particular point in time. But if you look at our non-COVID activity for the year as a whole, it is up compared to 2019. And so we anticipate that, at this particular juncture, continuing into 2022. Well, our inpatient surgeries were the only metric, again, as I mentioned in my comments that were down for the quarter. And that's because we used a lot of the space that was necessary for COVID patients. Our outpatient activity was up. It was up 7%. It was up more in our freestanding ASCs than it was in our hospitals, but both were up. And then when you look at it against 2019, I think, again, we had growth, with the exception of inpatient surgery freight. And that, again, is a direct correlation to the fact that we needed that space for COVID inpatients in order to manage our capacity from both staffing and a bed standpoint. I don't have all of it in front of me. Obviously, Florida and Texas were very intense geographies for us with the Delta variant. And so it's reasonable to assume that that's where we had more pressure in those markets than we did in other parts of the country. But that would be my reaction to that question, Frank. Thanks. Our belief is that demand for health care services is still strong. We think it's going to be 1.5% to 2% when you look out into the intermediate run and so forth. And we think for HCA, we have a differentiated portfolio of markets. And we have strong economies underneath that differentiated portfolio, where population growth, job growth and so forth is existent. And then we've had this pattern and we think this pattern can continue of market share gains. And as we look at where we are today versus where we were heading into 2020, we think we've improved our overall positioning competitively with the broader networks, more physicians, better clinical outcomes and so forth. And we will continue to resource our model. And we think that model still has growth embedded in it because of these factors. And we're not ready to give any particular guidance as it relates to out years. But we do think the company's approach can still yield successful return for our shareholders. Thank you, Whit. Well, let me start with the fact that our most recent market share data that we have, which is late last year, 2020 or first part of this year, I don't remember the exact period, shows us at a high watermark. We picked up market share in 2020 when I look at just sort of what happened in that year. So, I'll start with that. Additionally, we have added to our networks. We have added, in some cases, a few hospitals here and there, whether it's new hospitals that have opened or we've had small acquisitions of hospitals to round out our network offering. But in particular, on the outpatient side, we've added a reasonable number of new facilities, whether it's new urgent care center platform, new freestanding emergency rooms, some ambulatory surgery. And then we've added to our physician platform over the last 18 months. Some of which has been development of existing practices in our communities, but also new practice acquisitions that have added to our offerings. I think our outpatient facility capability is up to about 2,200 outpatient facilities. At the end of 2019, it was just a little north of 2,000. So we continue to add capabilities and convenience for our patients, again, creating a broader network offering in these communities. We have done some acquisitions. Our pipeline as it relates to outpatient acquisitions is strong. Also, our development pipeline of new outpatient facilities is robust, and we fueled that with investment. And then as Bill indicated, we have a strong pipeline of projects that will come online in 2022 and 2023 that are connected to both our hospital platform as well as our outpatient platform. So, we see, again, the model, the flywheel, if you will, of HCA continuing to produce solid results and deliver value to our patients and value to our shareholders. All right. Thank you, Lance. We do see complementary opportunities to use digital capabilities more effectively in our company. As I've mentioned on previous calls, advancing technology in our organization is a tremendous opportunity to improve care, support our physicians and nurses with decision-making capabilities as well as a more safe environment. We also see with that more consistency and transparency, which we believe can produce more efficiencies as we go through it. So, we've got a number of initiatives that are connected to that. In addition to that component, we are using telemedicine to support outreach to our patient population, and meet them where they want to be. And then we see opportunities for telemedicine to support what goes on inside of our facilities and preserve better care for our patients by helping our physicians and our nurses with really extended capabilities that can come from telemedicine inside the walls of our hospitals. So, those areas are progressing. They're showing early signs of value in some instances. And then when they connect with our care transformation agenda, which is being led by one of our physicians and his team, we're very excited about what that potentially yields in the form of better care, more efficient care and so forth. So, we have a number of initiatives underway. They're not completely implemented across the company because we're still studying what are the best approaches. But we're pretty excited about what this agenda can do for our organization. He's not leaving yet. We still got him for a little while, but... Well, we have certain aspects of value-based care embedded in, obviously, Medicare reimbursement. In some of our commercial contracts, we have aspects of value-based care component as part of our reimbursement methodologies. That will continue, I think, into the future. Is it accelerating in our facility structures? No. Inside of our physician platform, we do see opportunities to continue to push further into value-based care. Again, in that particular platform in our company, we have aspects of value-based care. They vary a little bit from one market to the other depending on the circumstances and the demographics and payer dynamics in those markets. So we do see it growing more in the physician platform than on the facility side, I would submit. But I think if you pull up, and you look at our relationships across the organization in the payer environment, they're very strong. We're 80%, 85% contracted for 2022. We're about 50% contracted for 2023 on terms that work for both organizations. They continue a lot of the structure that's already in place. And we evolve, as we renew with what's going on in the marketplace. We are in most commercial contracts in just about every market, where we do business. And in most Medicare Advantage relationships as well. So that's a key part of our approach. And that's why it's important for our model within each of the markets to be comprehensive, both in outpatient offerings, convenient for the patients. And then, having different price points for the payers, but ultimately creating a full system that can offer solutions. And we adjust those solutions to fit the situation with each payer. And some of that, again, can be value based. Some of it can be a different approach as to other reimbursement terms. But we think we're striking the right balance in how we approach that. Yeah, So when you look at the -- Gary, this is Sam. When you look at the third quarter of 2019, we cleared almost, what I call, 36% of EBITDA clearance. In other words, our margins in 2021 against 2019 were two times what the average margin was in 2019. And so obviously, it's significant compared to that same period then and we do see some structural pieces that Bill was alluding to. Obviously, there's a potential of inflation that we have to figure out exactly what the implications of that are. And we think some of our strategies will mitigate it. But we have been able to reposition the profitability of the company. And we're pushing to try to sustain those gains as much as we possibly can. I don't have -- I mean we have a pipeline of urgent care that I know is coming online in 2022 or 2023, again through acquisition or de novo development. We have maybe 10 or 12 ambulatory surgery centers. Some of which come online in the fourth quarter, some -- most come online in 2022 of that particular component. And then we have some other outpatient facilities that -- maybe 15 or so, and those categories come online in 2022, with another 15 or so in 2023. So we have a lot in different categories coming online. And that's part of the continued addition to our 2,200 outpatient facilities. And so I don't have the earnings expectations around those or a composite on each -- all of them in total. We -- but we do have a pretty active development. And those are complementary. And there's a natural ramp in them as well. And for the most part, we're really bullish on the prospects for those outpatient facilities."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I will like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Katherine. Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam and Bill, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based upon management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Good morning and thank you for joining us. With the effects of the pandemic moderating in the second quarter, we experienced a strong rebound in demand for our services. COVID admissions in the quarter were down to 3% of total as compared to 10% in the first quarter.  Volumes across all categories grew significantly compared to last year. And notably, we grew inpatient admissions and outpatient surgeries over 2019. The growth was supported by an improved payer mix, which resulted from an increase in commercial volume.  On a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 30% to $14.4 billion. Inpatient revenues increased 20%, driven by 17.5% admission growth. Outpatient revenues grew an impressive 59%, reflecting the resurgence in outpatient demand across most categories. To highlight a few areas. Outpatient surgeries were up 53%, emergency room visits grew 40%, cardiology procedures increased 41% and urgent care visits were up 82%. Compared to 2019, overall inpatient admissions grew almost 3% with commercial admissions growing 8%. Outpatient surgeries grew approximately 3.5%. Emergency room visits were only down 5.5% with the month of June basically flat. Acuity, however, in our emergency rooms was up with moderate growth in the most acute categories. We were able to leverage the increased revenue into higher margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved compared to last year, excluding the government stimulus income and sequentially in comparison to the first quarter. Diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, increased 35% to $4.37.  As noted in our release, EPS in the second quarter of 2020 included a $1.73 per diluted share benefit from government stimulus income. This benefit was reversed in the third quarter of 2020, as a result of the decision we made to return our entire share of provider relief funds from the CARES Act.  Once again, our teams delivered on our operating agenda. I want to thank them for their dedication and hard work. As we look to the rest of the year, we have raised our annual guidance to reflect the performance of the company over the first half of the year, and the belief that the current levels of demand should prolong over the remainder of the year. We continue to invest aggressively in our strategic plan, which revolves around building greater clinical capabilities to serve our communities, while also developing more comprehensive enterprise resources to support caregivers and differentiate our local networks. We believe this operating model will continue to create value for our patients, deliver market share growth and produce solid returns for our shareholders.  Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Bill for more details.\nBill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter, then review our updated 2021 guidance. As a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was 2.25 billion as compared to 8.7 billion in the second quarter of 2020.  In the prior year period, cash flow from operations was positively impacted by approximately 5.8 billion due to CARES Act receipts. And this year, we had approximately 850 million more income tax payments in the quarter than the prior year, due to the deferral of our second quarter 2020 estimated tax payments.  Capital spending for the quarter was 842 million, and we have approximately 3.8 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online between now and the end of 2023. We completed just under 2.3 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. We have approximately 5 billion remaining on our authorization. And consistent with our year-end discussion, we are planning on completing the majority of this in 2021, subject to market conditions.  Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.65x and we had approximately 5.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Meadows Regional Hospital in Vidalia, Georgia. We also closed on the Brookdale home health and hospice transaction as of July 1, 2021.  We have a number of other development transactions in our pipeline to expand our regional delivery networks, including over 15 surgery center additions through both de novo development and acquisitions as well as a number of urgent care and physician practice acquisitions.  We also anticipate the closing of our previously announced facility divestitures in Georgia later this quarter, and we plan to use the proceeds from this transaction for other capital allocation purposes.  As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2021 guidance as follows. We now expect revenues to range between 57 billion and 58 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between 12.1 billion and 12.5 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $16.30 and $17.10 per share. And our capital spending target remains at approximately 3.7 billion. As Sam mentioned, our revised guidance considers the strong results in the first half of the year, and our belief in the company's ability to continue this performance for the remainder of the year.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark and open it up for Q&A.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Sam, Bill, thank you so much. Katherine, I think we're ready for questions now if you could give instructions to the callers on the queue. Please limit yourself to one question so that we can try to get as many as possible. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hi. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a solid quarter. I guess, Bill, I'll follow up on the last part of your comment on the guidance. So you're expecting continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2. So, how are you thinking about the delta variants coming up? And just in terms of the backlog that you're seeing in terms of procedures that was delayed on the elective side from last year?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Brian, it\u2019s Bill. I\u2019ll take that. Obviously, our guidance factors in a lot of variables. We believe, overall, our volume, as indicated in the second quarter, will return to 2019 levels and perhaps moderately above that. We think we can maintain the acuity levels, even though that some lower acuity may come back into the system of the balance of the year. And overall, the overall payer mix I think will remain strong. Relative to COVID, as we mentioned in our year-end results, we anticipated serving COVID throughout all of the year, and indeed we're seeing that. As Sam mentioned in his comments, roughly 3% of our admissions were COVID in the second quarter compared to 10% in the first quarter. And I think we've proven the ability to manage through different cycles as they present themselves. And so we factored a number of variables into our guidance and believe, again, in the performance of the company to be able to deliver that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Great job here in the quarter in 2021. Guidance now brackets consensus for 2023. I understand it's way too early to think about 2022, but the new guidance begs that question a little bit. So if we think about the midpoint of 2021 guidance of 12.3 billion and we back out $600 million of government spending from sequestration, HR say in other COVID payments to about 11.7 billion. Is that the right launch pad for 2022? And if we assume a 4% EBITDA growth to get us to 12.2 billion for 2022, is that the right way to think about next year?\nBill Rutherford: Well, Pito, let me start and add Sam. I think it's a little early to put math to 2022 numbers. We obviously have some puts and takes going out through 2021. You correctly anticipate the government stimulus to approximate 600 million for full year. But it's really too early to start putting numbers to 2021. We do feel confident in the general direction that the company is seeing. And so, again, we'll reserve comments on specific guidance for 2022 at this standpoint.\nSam Hazen: And Pito, this is Sam. I want to add to Bill's comments there. I think when you think about the near term, and we're not defining that as '22. We're defining it as over a reasonable period of time post this year. We do believe that demand growth for healthcare services over the near term is going to remain solid. And we think with a differentiated portfolio of markets that we have inside of HCA Healthcare, that helps support that particular belief.  The second belief we have is that our provider system model has unique strength, and will allow us to compete effectively for market share. We also had a number of initiatives that we believe are appropriate in creating better services and more value for our stakeholders. And we think these will create opportunities for us as well. And then as Bill alluded to in his comments, our capital investment strategy, our balance sheet flexibility, really provides us support also for near-term objectives. And so we will get through the next quarter. And hopefully, by that time have some perspective, as we have in the past on how we see the upcoming year. But this is more of our near-term beliefs, and we think these are reasonable for the operations of our company.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Pito. Katherine?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. So if I could beat on margins I guess. How should we think about the normalized margin for you guys? And we're hearing more and more about labor pressure. So how are you thinking about specifically how labor might impact margins in the coming years?\nSam Hazen: Well, this is Sam. Let me speak to our labor agenda in general. First of all, our employees over the past 18 months have been just incredible. They stepped up. They\u2019ve shown up. They've delivered on our mission. They've delivered for their communities and they\u2019ve delivered for their patients. Obviously, as other industries are experiencing, we are in a difficult labor market. I will tell you that we have numerous initiatives underway to improve our overall position. We have invested significant amounts of resources into our recruitment functions. We have advanced our expansion of our Galen School of Nursing. And then we have put in compensation adjustments, some of which were in our numbers this quarter and some of which will show themselves in the future.  What we are encouraged by is each month this year, we've seen sequential improvement in overall labor metrics with respect to turnover, with respect to recruitment. And so we're encouraged by our efforts up to this point. I will also tell you that our labor costs from the second quarter to the -- from the first quarter rather to the second quarter are essentially stable, which gives us some confidence that our efforts are working. Obviously, there's still uncertainty with respect to inflation. We will be focused on doing the right thing for our employees as we move forward in managing through this period. And we think, again, we have a number of initiatives that can help address some of these pressures that might evolve.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Kevin's question, just talking specifically on margins. They're up 200 basis points versus 2019 and what you guided to originally pre-COVID in 2020. So I'm just wondering if you could break that down maybe between better acuity you've seen, better payer mix, the cost cutting you've done, and maybe some of the government program dollars, and just talk about the sustainability there. And then I apologize if I missed this, Bill, but if you could run up the acuity numbers, that would be great as well. Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. So, Justin, obviously, a lot of factors go into the margins. You see in our guidance, we're raising our margin expectations compared to our original discussion as we went into the year. And I think that's reflective of all the variables. Clearly margin is being driven by the volume returns to 2019 levels, the favorable acuity, as well as the favorable payer mix. And then we continue to have a number of cost initiatives that we're managing through.  So, as we think about where we stand today and the balance of the year, the margins reflect more like our average that we've experienced over the past four quarters. The acuity, we still saw some growth in 2020. It was about 2% growth over 2020, about 5% growth over 2019 levels. So that's continuing to show strength. And so we'll have to see where that falls out for the balance of the year. But overall, we feel reasonably confident on the margin projections we have. And I think our guidance reflects a pretty significant increase in the margin expectations compared to where our original expectations were as we turn the calendar.\nMark Kimbrough: All right, Justin, thank you so much. Katherine?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Impressive quarter across the board really. I guess, I'll just try to drill down a little bit more on what you're seeing volume wise. I know the market share of third party statistics come in with the delay, but I'm assuming you have some sort of local assessments you do. How much of the volume rebound is stronger than I would have thought certainly to be ahead of '19 levels? It's impressive. How much of that do you think is your picking up market even the way you responded to COVID, your investments you\u2019ve done on the CapEx side?  And how much is the underlying market? And you're expressing confidence about the back half the year. Do you have any -- I guess you have some scheduling of procedures that you can look at and what the physicians are telling you and you own a lot of physicians. So maybe just something about why you're confident on the volume sort of having that sustainability as opposed to this being a spike that then moderates?\nMark Kimbrough: All right, A.J. Thank you. Sam, Bill?\nSam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam, A.J. Thank you for that question. We have had fits and starts over the last three or four quarters with a couple of months here, a couple of months there, then we went into COVID surges and it had created difficulties in our ability to judge precisely where we were in the market. So we've had essentially four solid months; March, April, May and June, where we've been able to judge the market with some level of confidence. And what we see is, as I mentioned, the ability to move markets here. I don't know that we moved in this last quarter necessarily, because we don't have the data. But if you look at our progression over time, you've seen a pattern of market share growth. And again, I think that speaks to the model, I think it speaks to the resource allocation that we put forth and it speaks to the execution by our teams in the field. And so we're really proud of that. At the beginning of 2011, we had 23% market share. At the end of that decade, we had over 27%. We have continued to see annual growth in our most recent data points. So we believe that system capability still exists and it\u2019s possibly showing itself in the second quarter, but we need more time to fully judge that. But these four months have given us a reasonable perspective on what's happening in the markets; job growth, more people insured with the Affordable Care Act, investments that we're making, execution on our physician and program development strategy, and continuing to manage the network most effectively we think gives us reasonable visibility into the last half of the year. And that's why we're judging that the demand is going to endure over the remaining two quarters. So we don't have anything other than our analysis of these four months, A.J., that would suggest it. But we believe with our study [Technical Difficulty] their individual markets. So that's the reason for the guidance.\nMark Kimbrough: A.J., thank you for the question. Katherine?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nMark Kimbrough: Hi, Scott.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just ask a follow-up question around the planned capital investments that you highlighted that were north of 3 billion through 2023. And specifically just interested if you can talk about the mix of those investments as they relate to inpatient versus let\u2019s call it outpatient and tertiary and other investments? Just interested in, as you look sort of historically at the mix of investments, how those may be evolving as we've seen some shifts in site of care clearly playing out post pandemic? Thanks.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Sam?\nSam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam. Just so you have a sense of our networks today, we have roughly 185 hospitals. And then we have over 2,000, almost 2,200 outpatient facilities. So think about our network as almost 11 to 1, outpatient to hospital. Now the capital intensity in the 185 hospitals is clearly more than the outpatient facility. So as Bill mentioned in his comments, we have a significant amount of capital going to ambulatory surgery centers, but amatory surgery center per unit is only $10 million or $12 million in order to get an investment done, a urgent care center is a couple million, a freestanding emergency room is $10 million investment. So these are small dollar unit investments, but they add to our network capability and then support our hospitals in a way that ultimately create hopefully a closed loop where a patient can stay inside of one of our systems, because of the services and so forth that we offer. As it relates to our capital investment, our hospitals will always consume more of the capital just because of the intensity that it requires to have the brick and mortar associated with the heavy clinical equipment and such. But we have plenty of capacity in our spending, allowing us to invest aggressively in our outpatient network to support our facilities. So we're adding this to our facilities in many markets, because we're still running at very high occupancies. I think our occupancy in the second quarter was 73%. We have 41,000 beds in HCA operational, and we're running north of 30,000 patients a day inside of those facilities. And then as we speak to building out our capabilities, we are investing in many outpatient and ambulatory facilities, creating a more convenient, easier to access offering for our patients at a better price point so that it fits within our overall network configuration. But those investments, again, will not overcome the amount of inpatient investments that we make. Additionally, we are investing in our technology platforms and we will continue to invest in technology. We see a real opportunity in the future to advance technology and enable the company even more significantly than we do today, delivering what we believe to be an opportunity for much better care, do it in a more engaging way with our patient population, and then ultimately achieve efficiencies as a result of those investments. We're very excited about that platform. More to come on that in the future, but we see opportunities there as well.\nMark Kimbrough: Scott, thank you for your question. Katherine, next question please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.\nMark Kimbrough: Hi, Ralph.\nRalph Giacobbe: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So you guys mentioned commercial up I think 8% over 2019. Can you maybe just give us a sense of volume trends for Medicare and Medicaid? And then any way to gauge population growth, particularly in your Texas and Florida markets, and maybe how much that's aided the payer mix at this point? Thanks.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Ralph.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Ralph, this is Bill. I think we saw recovery volume in every payer class, and that includes Medicare. Our Medicare volume was just under 4% below '19 levels, and that compares to where we have been running 8% to 10% below. So we\u2019ve seen recovering volume in the Medicare class as well. Obviously, it's more favorable in the commercial and managed care. So that's resulting in a strong overall payer mix area. In terms of overall demand, I don't have information on that. We're generally a couple of quarters in arrears to see that. So we're going to have to just wait to see when that data comes out. Our belief just looking and hearing the markets as we see demand recovering as the economy and markets are opening back up, we'll have to see what that actually yields in terms of the percentage of demand that we're seeing. But it's our belief we're starting to see demand recover throughout most of our markets.\nMark Kimbrough: All right, Ralph, thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research.\nMark Kimbrough: Hi, Josh. Good morning.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi. Good morning. Just the ED visits I know are running 5.5% below 2019 in the quarter. I think you said June was almost flat. Are those stabilizing in your view? Is that the new normal level? Do you think EDs have actually fully recovered back to pre-pandemic levels? And then are you seeing any changes in the percentage of those ED visits that are getting admitted, that are becoming actual admissions and maybe even any differences by payer segment?\nSam Hazen: Well, one month, June, doesn't necessarily suggest a pattern. Although we think the second quarter is more likely reflective of activity in the ER than previous quarters when we were down 15% to 20%. We knew there would be some recovery in the emergency rooms. And we haven't seen the effects of schools going back yet either. So that is an area our pediatric activity where we've seen significant shortfalls by comparison to 2019 still even in the second quarter. So that would provide some potential support as kids get back to school and engage in their normal activities. As it relates to the acuity of our emergency room population throughout 2020 and on into the first half of 2021, we have continued to see in our emergency rooms more acute patient populations. That has in fact yielded admission growth in our emergency rooms. Our admissions grew in the second quarter of '21 over '19 as a result of that acuity, and we anticipate that that will also endure throughout the remainder of the year.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Josh, thank you so much for your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.\nJamie Perse: Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to go back to the EBITDA margin piece and your guidance for the rest of the year. It looks like the second half guidance implies a lower margin rate than the first half of the year. So I wanted to get any specific incremental pressures you see for the balance of the year. On a related note to premium labor utilization and premium labor rates, are those continued to come down relative to recent trends?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, let me start with margins. As I tried to talk about before as we kind of project the balance of the year, there's a lot of variables that go into that. And I think you'll see that our margin that we're projecting is a pretty significant increase from our original projection, and more looks like our margin average for the past four quarters. And we'll just have to see how the various variables play out. We don't have anything specific we're calling out on that. We know we're running a little high in the first half. I think some of our first quarter COVID volume maybe contributed to that. But our margins for the full year are really reflective of our past four quarter average. On the premium labor, Sam?\nSam Hazen: Well, we did have more premium labor utilization in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter, and that put a little pressure on our labor costs. We were able to absorb that with the volume and the outpatient activity that we mentioned. We anticipate, again, that our labor agenda for recruitment, retention, compensation adjustments and so forth will start to moderate that pressure over the remainder of the year. But we continue to be mindful of that particular item. But obviously, we're having to staff the volume that we've gotten, in some instances -- many instances actually, we're having to use premium labor at this point.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Jamie, thank you so much.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nMark Kimbrough: Hi, Lance.\nLance Wilkes: Hi. How are you doing? Great quarter. Just if I could ask about impacts of value-based care on the business, in particular impacts on volumes. Just interested if that's causing any pressure in any particular markets where you're seeing the rise of some of those risks there in primary care, or if it's in fact helping you if you're taking more of that share? And maybe just a quick cleanup question on Medicaid volume relative to 2019, if you're seeing that up or down?\nSam Hazen: Thank you. We\u2019ve spoken to value-based programs over the years and nothing has really changed in our estimation over the past year, year and a half with respect to those. In many markets, we have to respond to the dynamics in those markets. South Florida's probably the most advanced managed care market in the country. We have 24%, 25% market share in that particular region, with many investments underway to improve our position overall. So our ability navigating some of the deepest and most complex managed care markets I think has been proven over time. We nuance our strategy from one market to the other, to respond to what our payers feel they need to be responsive to their customer base. We have great relationship, great partnerships in many instances with the various payers. We're in a great position as it looks to 2022 with respect to our contracting. And so I think from that standpoint, nothing material is out there, either influencing demand in any significant way, nor putting us in a position where we don't feel like we're appropriately positioned with the payers\u2019 objectives in allowing them to push forward on whatever agenda they think appropriate. \nBill Rutherford: Hi, Lance. This is Bill. On your Medicaid question, we're up about 4% over 2019 on a year-to-date basis. We were relatively flat first quarter and we're up just under 9% in the second quarter.\nMark Kimbrough: Okay. All right. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. Obviously, we're excited about the quarter. I\u2019m around if you have any additional questions for the rest of the week, and please feel free to give me a call. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter, then review our updated 2021 guidance. As a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was 2.25 billion as compared to 8.7 billion in the second quarter of 2020.  In the prior year period, cash flow from operations was positively impacted by approximately 5.8 billion due to CARES Act receipts. And this year, we had approximately 850 million more income tax payments in the quarter than the prior year, due to the deferral of our second quarter 2020 estimated tax payments.  Capital spending for the quarter was 842 million, and we have approximately 3.8 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online between now and the end of 2023. We completed just under 2.3 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. We have approximately 5 billion remaining on our authorization. And consistent with our year-end discussion, we are planning on completing the majority of this in 2021, subject to market conditions.  Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.65x and we had approximately 5.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Meadows Regional Hospital in Vidalia, Georgia. We also closed on the Brookdale home health and hospice transaction as of July 1, 2021.  We have a number of other development transactions in our pipeline to expand our regional delivery networks, including over 15 surgery center additions through both de novo development and acquisitions as well as a number of urgent care and physician practice acquisitions.  We also anticipate the closing of our previously announced facility divestitures in Georgia later this quarter, and we plan to use the proceeds from this transaction for other capital allocation purposes.  As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2021 guidance as follows. We now expect revenues to range between 57 billion and 58 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between 12.1 billion and 12.5 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $16.30 and $17.10 per share. And our capital spending target remains at approximately 3.7 billion. As Sam mentioned, our revised guidance considers the strong results in the first half of the year, and our belief in the company's ability to continue this performance for the remainder of the year.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark and open it up for Q&A. Yes. Brian, it's Bill. I'll take that. Obviously, our guidance factors in a lot of variables. We believe, overall, our volume, as indicated in the second quarter, will return to 2019 levels and perhaps moderately above that. We think we can maintain the acuity levels, even though that some lower acuity may come back into the system of the balance of the year. And overall, the overall payer mix I think will remain strong. Relative to COVID, as we mentioned in our year-end results, we anticipated serving COVID throughout all of the year, and indeed we're seeing that. As Sam mentioned in his comments, roughly 3% of our admissions were COVID in the second quarter compared to 10% in the first quarter. And I think we've proven the ability to manage through different cycles as they present themselves. And so we factored a number of variables into our guidance and believe, again, in the performance of the company to be able to deliver that. Well, Pito, let me start and add Sam. I think it's a little early to put math to 2022 numbers. We obviously have some puts and takes going out through 2021. You correctly anticipate the government stimulus to approximate 600 million for full year. But it's really too early to start putting numbers to 2021. We do feel confident in the general direction that the company is seeing. And so, again, we'll reserve comments on specific guidance for 2022 at this standpoint. Yes. So, Justin, obviously, a lot of factors go into the margins. You see in our guidance, we're raising our margin expectations compared to our original discussion as we went into the year. And I think that's reflective of all the variables. Clearly margin is being driven by the volume returns to 2019 levels, the favorable acuity, as well as the favorable payer mix. And then we continue to have a number of cost initiatives that we're managing through.  So, as we think about where we stand today and the balance of the year, the margins reflect more like our average that we've experienced over the past four quarters. The acuity, we still saw some growth in 2020. It was about 2% growth over 2020, about 5% growth over 2019 levels. So that's continuing to show strength. And so we'll have to see where that falls out for the balance of the year. But overall, we feel reasonably confident on the margin projections we have. And I think our guidance reflects a pretty significant increase in the margin expectations compared to where our original expectations were as we turn the calendar. Yes. Ralph, this is Bill. I think we saw recovery volume in every payer class, and that includes Medicare. Our Medicare volume was just under 4% below '19 levels, and that compares to where we have been running 8% to 10% below. So we've seen recovering volume in the Medicare class as well. Obviously, it's more favorable in the commercial and managed care. So that's resulting in a strong overall payer mix area. In terms of overall demand, I don't have information on that. We're generally a couple of quarters in arrears to see that. So we're going to have to just wait to see when that data comes out. Our belief just looking and hearing the markets as we see demand recovering as the economy and markets are opening back up, we'll have to see what that actually yields in terms of the percentage of demand that we're seeing. But it's our belief we're starting to see demand recover throughout most of our markets. Yes, let me start with margins. As I tried to talk about before as we kind of project the balance of the year, there's a lot of variables that go into that. And I think you'll see that our margin that we're projecting is a pretty significant increase from our original projection, and more looks like our margin average for the past four quarters. And we'll just have to see how the various variables play out. We don't have anything specific we're calling out on that. We know we're running a little high in the first half. I think some of our first quarter COVID volume maybe contributed to that. But our margins for the full year are really reflective of our past four quarter average. On the premium labor, Sam? Hi, Lance. This is Bill. On your Medicaid question, we're up about 4% over 2019 on a year-to-date basis. We were relatively flat first quarter and we're up just under 9% in the second quarter."

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With the effects of the pandemic moderating in the second quarter, we experienced a strong rebound in demand for our services. COVID admissions in the quarter were down to 3% of total as compared to 10% in the first quarter.  Volumes across all categories grew significantly compared to last year. And notably, we grew inpatient admissions and outpatient surgeries over 2019. The growth was supported by an improved payer mix, which resulted from an increase in commercial volume.  On a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 30% to $14.4 billion. Inpatient revenues increased 20%, driven by 17.5% admission growth. Outpatient revenues grew an impressive 59%, reflecting the resurgence in outpatient demand across most categories. To highlight a few areas. Outpatient surgeries were up 53%, emergency room visits grew 40%, cardiology procedures increased 41% and urgent care visits were up 82%. Compared to 2019, overall inpatient admissions grew almost 3% with commercial admissions growing 8%. Outpatient surgeries grew approximately 3.5%. Emergency room visits were only down 5.5% with the month of June basically flat. Acuity, however, in our emergency rooms was up with moderate growth in the most acute categories. We were able to leverage the increased revenue into higher margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved compared to last year, excluding the government stimulus income and sequentially in comparison to the first quarter. Diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, increased 35% to $4.37.  As noted in our release, EPS in the second quarter of 2020 included a $1.73 per diluted share benefit from government stimulus income. This benefit was reversed in the third quarter of 2020, as a result of the decision we made to return our entire share of provider relief funds from the CARES Act.  Once again, our teams delivered on our operating agenda. I want to thank them for their dedication and hard work. As we look to the rest of the year, we have raised our annual guidance to reflect the performance of the company over the first half of the year, and the belief that the current levels of demand should prolong over the remainder of the year. We continue to invest aggressively in our strategic plan, which revolves around building greater clinical capabilities to serve our communities, while also developing more comprehensive enterprise resources to support caregivers and differentiate our local networks. We believe this operating model will continue to create value for our patients, deliver market share growth and produce solid returns for our shareholders.  Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Bill for more details. And Pito, this is Sam. I want to add to Bill's comments there. I think when you think about the near term, and we're not defining that as '22. We're defining it as over a reasonable period of time post this year. We do believe that demand growth for healthcare services over the near term is going to remain solid. And we think with a differentiated portfolio of markets that we have inside of HCA Healthcare, that helps support that particular belief.  The second belief we have is that our provider system model has unique strength, and will allow us to compete effectively for market share. We also had a number of initiatives that we believe are appropriate in creating better services and more value for our stakeholders. And we think these will create opportunities for us as well. And then as Bill alluded to in his comments, our capital investment strategy, our balance sheet flexibility, really provides us support also for near-term objectives. And so we will get through the next quarter. And hopefully, by that time have some perspective, as we have in the past on how we see the upcoming year. But this is more of our near-term beliefs, and we think these are reasonable for the operations of our company. Well, this is Sam. Let me speak to our labor agenda in general. First of all, our employees over the past 18 months have been just incredible. They stepped up. They've shown up. They've delivered on our mission. They've delivered for their communities and they've delivered for their patients. Obviously, as other industries are experiencing, we are in a difficult labor market. I will tell you that we have numerous initiatives underway to improve our overall position. We have invested significant amounts of resources into our recruitment functions. We have advanced our expansion of our Galen School of Nursing. And then we have put in compensation adjustments, some of which were in our numbers this quarter and some of which will show themselves in the future.  What we are encouraged by is each month this year, we've seen sequential improvement in overall labor metrics with respect to turnover, with respect to recruitment. And so we're encouraged by our efforts up to this point. I will also tell you that our labor costs from the second quarter to the -- from the first quarter rather to the second quarter are essentially stable, which gives us some confidence that our efforts are working. Obviously, there's still uncertainty with respect to inflation. We will be focused on doing the right thing for our employees as we move forward in managing through this period. And we think, again, we have a number of initiatives that can help address some of these pressures that might evolve. Yes. This is Sam, A.J. Thank you for that question. We have had fits and starts over the last three or four quarters with a couple of months here, a couple of months there, then we went into COVID surges and it had created difficulties in our ability to judge precisely where we were in the market. So we've had essentially four solid months; March, April, May and June, where we've been able to judge the market with some level of confidence. And what we see is, as I mentioned, the ability to move markets here. I don't know that we moved in this last quarter necessarily, because we don't have the data. But if you look at our progression over time, you've seen a pattern of market share growth. And again, I think that speaks to the model, I think it speaks to the resource allocation that we put forth and it speaks to the execution by our teams in the field. And so we're really proud of that. At the beginning of 2011, we had 23% market share. At the end of that decade, we had over 27%. We have continued to see annual growth in our most recent data points. So we believe that system capability still exists and it's possibly showing itself in the second quarter, but we need more time to fully judge that. But these four months have given us a reasonable perspective on what's happening in the markets; job growth, more people insured with the Affordable Care Act, investments that we're making, execution on our physician and program development strategy, and continuing to manage the network most effectively we think gives us reasonable visibility into the last half of the year. And that's why we're judging that the demand is going to endure over the remaining two quarters. So we don't have anything other than our analysis of these four months, A.J., that would suggest it. But we believe with our study [Technical Difficulty] their individual markets. So that's the reason for the guidance. Yes. This is Sam. Just so you have a sense of our networks today, we have roughly 185 hospitals. And then we have over 2,000, almost 2,200 outpatient facilities. So think about our network as almost 11 to 1, outpatient to hospital. Now the capital intensity in the 185 hospitals is clearly more than the outpatient facility. So as Bill mentioned in his comments, we have a significant amount of capital going to ambulatory surgery centers, but amatory surgery center per unit is only $10 million or $12 million in order to get an investment done, a urgent care center is a couple million, a freestanding emergency room is $10 million investment. So these are small dollar unit investments, but they add to our network capability and then support our hospitals in a way that ultimately create hopefully a closed loop where a patient can stay inside of one of our systems, because of the services and so forth that we offer. As it relates to our capital investment, our hospitals will always consume more of the capital just because of the intensity that it requires to have the brick and mortar associated with the heavy clinical equipment and such. But we have plenty of capacity in our spending, allowing us to invest aggressively in our outpatient network to support our facilities. So we're adding this to our facilities in many markets, because we're still running at very high occupancies. I think our occupancy in the second quarter was 73%. We have 41,000 beds in HCA operational, and we're running north of 30,000 patients a day inside of those facilities. And then as we speak to building out our capabilities, we are investing in many outpatient and ambulatory facilities, creating a more convenient, easier to access offering for our patients at a better price point so that it fits within our overall network configuration. But those investments, again, will not overcome the amount of inpatient investments that we make. Additionally, we are investing in our technology platforms and we will continue to invest in technology. We see a real opportunity in the future to advance technology and enable the company even more significantly than we do today, delivering what we believe to be an opportunity for much better care, do it in a more engaging way with our patient population, and then ultimately achieve efficiencies as a result of those investments. We're very excited about that platform. More to come on that in the future, but we see opportunities there as well. Well, one month, June, doesn't necessarily suggest a pattern. Although we think the second quarter is more likely reflective of activity in the ER than previous quarters when we were down 15% to 20%. We knew there would be some recovery in the emergency rooms. And we haven't seen the effects of schools going back yet either. So that is an area our pediatric activity where we've seen significant shortfalls by comparison to 2019 still even in the second quarter. So that would provide some potential support as kids get back to school and engage in their normal activities. As it relates to the acuity of our emergency room population throughout 2020 and on into the first half of 2021, we have continued to see in our emergency rooms more acute patient populations. That has in fact yielded admission growth in our emergency rooms. Our admissions grew in the second quarter of '21 over '19 as a result of that acuity, and we anticipate that that will also endure throughout the remainder of the year. Well, we did have more premium labor utilization in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter, and that put a little pressure on our labor costs. We were able to absorb that with the volume and the outpatient activity that we mentioned. We anticipate, again, that our labor agenda for recruitment, retention, compensation adjustments and so forth will start to moderate that pressure over the remainder of the year. But we continue to be mindful of that particular item. But obviously, we're having to staff the volume that we've gotten, in some instances -- many instances actually, we're having to use premium labor at this point. Thank you. We've spoken to value-based programs over the years and nothing has really changed in our estimation over the past year, year and a half with respect to those. In many markets, we have to respond to the dynamics in those markets. South Florida's probably the most advanced managed care market in the country. We have 24%, 25% market share in that particular region, with many investments underway to improve our position overall. So our ability navigating some of the deepest and most complex managed care markets I think has been proven over time. We nuance our strategy from one market to the other, to respond to what our payers feel they need to be responsive to their customer base. We have great relationship, great partnerships in many instances with the various payers. We're in a great position as it looks to 2022 with respect to our contracting. And so I think from that standpoint, nothing material is out there, either influencing demand in any significant way, nor putting us in a position where we don't feel like we're appropriately positioned with the payers' objectives in allowing them to push forward on whatever agenda they think appropriate."

More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release as well as in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge, we started the year with strong financial results in the first quarter. The results were driven by better-than-expected revenue growth and improved operating margins. Revenues grew over $1.1 billion, or 8.7% as compared to the prior year. This growth was generated by highly acute inpatient volumes, better payer mix, and a rebound in surgical and outpatient volumes in March. Generally speaking, March trends are continuing into April. Inpatient revenues increased by 12%. The acuity within our inpatient business was higher as reflected in both the case mix index, which increased 7% and length of stay which grew by 6%. Additionally, commercial admits inside of our domestic operations represented 29% of total admits, compared to 26.5% last year. Commercial payer mix has been consistently around this level for the past four quarters. These two factors combined explain the 17% increase in inpatient revenue per admissions. The total - the total admits were down 4.2% year-over-year. In comparison to 2019, admits were down approximately 3%, which was - which was in line with our expectations. In the quarter, we treated almost 50,000 COVID-19 inpatients, which represented 10% of total admissions. Throughout the quarter, the percentage of COVID-19 admits to total admits declined. January with 17%, February was 8%, and March was down to almost 5%. Outpatient revenues increased 4.7% as compared to prior year. This result is better performance than the previous two quarters in which outpatient revenue was down approximately 5%. Outpatient revenues declined in January and February, consistent with that trend. But March, which had one additional weekday this year, increased by 30% as outpatient surgery and other procedures recovered strongly. Same facility outpatient surgery volumes grew 2.3% as compared to last year. As compared to 2019, they declined 3%. E.R. visits declined 18%. This decrease is generally consistent with the trends we experienced in the previous two quarters. E.R. visits were down 19% compared to 2019. Our teams continue to focus and deliver on our operating agenda. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the company grew on a year-over-year basis and was consistent on a sequential basis with the prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales, as well as losses on debt retirement, increase 78% to $4.14. During the quarter, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in the home health and hospitals business of Brookdale Senior Living. This business provides us with a large platform that complements our local provider systems. It will expand the services we offer across our networks and provide us with more enterprise capabilities to coordinate care for our patients and improve their experiences. Additionally, we believe the home will become a more important setting for healthcare in the future with continuing growth and demand. We anticipate this transaction will close in the third quarter and we look forward to our new partnership with Brookdale. Also during the quarter, we opened two new hospitals, one in Denver and one in Orlando. Each of these hospitals will strengthen our system offerings in these communities. In the second quarter, we expect to close on the acquisitions of two small hospitals both of which complement our networks in Nashville and Savannah. And lastly, we continue to invest broadly across our networks to improve convenience, access, and value for patients by developing more outpatient facilities. The pipeline for development and acquisition in this category remains strong. As we look to the rest of the year, we have increased our annual guidance to reflect the first quarter's performance and better perspective on important macro factors. Mainly, governmental reimbursement and economic outlooks for our markets, including uninsured assumptions. Bill will provide more details on our guidance in his comments. The first quarter is yet another period where the disciplined operating culture and strong execution by our teams were on display. I want to thank our 275,000 colleagues and 50,000 physicians for their tremendous work. We could not have performed at this level without their unwavering commitment to our patients and the communities we serve. As we continue to resource and execute on our strategic agenda, we will remain true to our mission of improving lives and delivering on the responsibilities we have to all our stakeholders. And now, I turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Rutherford: Good morning, everyone. Sam spoke to many of our operating metrics and results. So I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter. Then review our updated 2021 guidance. As a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.99 billion, as compared to $1.375 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Capital spending for the quarter was $654 million, and we completed just over $1.5 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. We have approximately $7.3 billion remaining on our authorization. And consistent with our year end discussion, we are planning on completing the majority of this in 2021, subject to market conditions. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.85 times, and we had approximately $5.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2021 guidance as follows. We expect revenue to range between $54 billion and $55.5 billion. We expect full year EBITDA to range between $10.85 billion and $11.35 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $13.30 and $14.30 and our capital spending target remains at approximately $3.7 billion. Our revised guidance considers the strong results in the first quarter and also considers the extension of the public health emergency and the deferral of sequestration reductions through the end of the year. In summary, we recognize some uncertainties remain as we go through the balance of the year, but we are confident in the company's ability to manage through various business cycles, and we are well positioned to continue to invest capital to capture growth opportunities and execute on acquisition opportunities if they become available. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark and then open up for Q&A.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Sam. Kara, we\u2019re going to open-up for questions. Please remind everyone to limit their questions to one so that we might get try and get as many in the queue as possible.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: [Technical Difficulty]\nMark Kimbrough: Hey, Pito, Pito you\u2019re breaking up. I can\u2019t hear you. Kara, let's try with next one, Pito try calling back in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I guess my question would be on guidance. I guess, first a clarification. Your guidance, I assume, does not include the two deals you expect in Q2 or the Brookdale acquisition, but then more to the point as far as guidance. How do you think about the upside? Because it sounded like a lot of the raise is because of sequestration and the extension of the health emergency. I mean, how much of this outperformance and guidance rate do you think of as kind of one-time versus things that we should be thinking about as you having a better visibility into future growth in 2022 and 2023?\nBill Rutherford: Thanks, Kevin. Kevin, let me answer that. First, you're right. The acquisitions for the balance of the year are not included in our expectations, but we don't expect that material contribution from those \u2013 for this year. Relative to our increase in guidance, largely due to the strong performance that we had in the first quarter is the driver of that. As Sam talked, we have some insight into March and the read-through through April. And then we did consider the continuation of the deferral of sequestration through the balance of the year. And we know the public health emergency got extended at least through 90 days through July. So the majority of the guidance range is a result of our performance from the first quarter and considers the extension of the sequestration on there. So, as we've talked about at our year-end call, there's still variables out there, but the way we're reading the environment right now is generally positive.\nMark Kimbrough: Thank you, Kevin. Kara, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.\nFrank Morgan: Margins and obviously, big expansion year-over-year and you sustained nice margins from the previous quarter. But can you just give us any more color around the dynamics of your ability to continue to manage costs this way? I mean, it really looked like it was across everything, labor supplies, other. Is it more a function of just the top line growth? Or is there something structural on the cost side that's allowing you to take advantage of having flex labor. Just any color there would be appreciated. Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Frank, this is Bill. I'll start. I think the margin is primarily attributable to the top line with the revenue and the acuity and the payer mix that we had. But we continue to be focused on looking for efficiencies throughout the company, as we've talked about our resiliency plans in the past. And so those efforts continue, and many of them are well underway in almost every category. And so that is a part of the performance of the company. But the margins clearly are being helped by both the acuity and the payer mix and the revenue per adjusted admission that we're seeing. But as we've talked about multiple times, we are continuing to look for as much efficiency as we can as we go through different cycles. And many of those efforts continue to be underway.\nSam Hazen: Bill, if I can just add to that. Our cost per adjusted patient day was in line with our expectations and actually slightly underneath that. And so we were only seeing in the face of really a difficult labor market, 3% growth in cost per adjusted patient day. So I think, it's a combination of both, but obviously, with the mix, that helps, Frank.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Frank.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you.\nMark Kimbrough: Kara?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nSam Hazen: Hey, A.J.\nA.J. Rice: Hi. Maybe just ask a little bit more about the capital deployment opportunities. I know last quarterly call, you guys had mentioned potentially looking at some post-acute care dynamic. And then obviously, you've had the announcement about Brookdale. Perhaps that was what you were alluding to last quarter. But maybe talk about your appetite there and whether you're seeing broader health system. I know you have two hospital deals, but maybe broader health systems, there was some thought that they might look to partner up coming out of the pandemic? Or have you seen any uptick in activity there? And then finally, on this capital deployment, spending around your CapEx, are you moving \u2013 I mean, you're still emphasizing access points, but I wondered whether investments in ER, for example, might be diminished given what we've seen coming out of the pandemic and less ER activity, maybe you've diverted some of that money elsewhere. So, just some comments on capital deployment opportunities.\nSam Hazen: Okay. A.J., this is Sam. I'll try to respond to those. I remember all the elements. On post-acute, let me speak to that. Obviously, home care opportunity and hospice opportunity to us, we believe, is a significant expansion of the services we offer. And the opportunities for integrating those patients who are discharged and we discharge about 250,000 patients a year into home care creates an opportunity for us to coordinate care better, stay connected to the patient after they leave our facilities and ultimately integrate them more effectively in the HCA Healthcare system. So we see a nice broad opportunity. We believe home care provides multiple channels of value for us, some of which are in the discharges that we talked about, some of it's in better case management and discharge planning and some of it is staying connected to the patient when they repurchase healthcare. Also on post-acute, we mentioned before because of the CON relaxation in Florida, we have made a large commitment to inpatient rehabilitation facilities in the state of Florida, where we have the greatest opportunity to do the same thing with rehab. So we've invested somewhere between $250 million and $300 million or we are investing rather in developing rehab services in the state of Florida, which will expand the offerings in those markets to our patients and support our systems. So we still see potential in both of those areas to expand into more significant relationships with Medicare Advantage payers potentially on post-acute, so it creates opportunities for us in multiple ways.  As it relates to our capital spending, as we mentioned in our guidance for 2021, we are increasing our capital budget to somewhere around $3.7 billion. Much of that increase is related to growth projects where we are expanding at facilities where we need to expand. We're still running the company north of 70% inpatient occupancy, and many of our facilities are north of that. And so in order for us to capitalize on this differentiated portfolio we have, where we believe our markets have unique growth prospects because of great economies, population growth and so forth, we need to create capacity both on the inpatient in certain circumstances and build out the networks additionally with outpatient facilities as we mentioned. With respect to ER specifically, we do see ample supply, generally speaking, with our ER beds today. We will have some continued investments in emergency room supply and capacity across certain markets because, number one, in some cases, we need it. We continue to operate at high levels, or two, we have freestanding emergency room opportunities. And we will invest in those, but they're not nearly as significant as they were five years ago when we were investing more heavily in that. So that flexibility will allow us to invest in ambulatory surgery centers, where we have a tremendously strong pipeline for new development. I think we have 10 or 12 new ambulatory surgery centers that are under development. We have a robust pipeline in that particular category as well. And then we will also invest in urgent care, recognizing that, that continues to serve a role in building out the capabilities inside of our markets. As it pertains to M&A, I do think there are going to be opportunities. As we've mentioned in the past, they come when they come. It's hard for us to predict. We are fortunate to have a balance sheet that can take advantage of those opportunities as presented. We have an enterprise chassis, if you will, that is built to be bigger and to bolt-on new opportunities and create synergies and value inside of those systems. And so we will continue to look for those as they develop and hopefully find opportunities that make sense for us. Thank you.\nA.J. Rice: Great. Thanks.\nMark Kimbrough: Thanks, A.J.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Let's get one more try Pito.\nPito Chickering: All right. Could you guys hear me now?\nSam Hazen: Yes.\nMark Kimbrough: We can hear you.\nPito Chickering: Take two. All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you give us the components of the 2021 guidance raise? How much is due this strong first quarter? How much it due to additional government funding and any changes to the back half of the year? And as you look at the margins in the back half of the year, you'll face tough comps and good pricing and mix due to COVID. Can you help us walk through the gives and takes are on the assumptions for margins, including the payer mix, circular trends and labor costs?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Pito, so this is Bill. Let me try to zero in on that. As I answered Kevin's, majority was due to the strong performance. We understand we beat our expectations and depending on your number anywhere from $300 million to $400 million that we expected the first half of the year to be stronger than the second half, but it still outpaced our expectations. The sequestration extension for the end of the year is probably worth anywhere from $40 million to $50 million a quarter. So that added \u2013 we originally did not anticipate that continuing past the first quarter. So that's an element of the raise, too. So if you look at the midpoint, our raise was $500 million. You could say, it's probably $350 million to $400 million from our performance and then the balance through these government extensions, if you want to have specifics on that. But we also have a range with variables that are \u2013 that continue to play out. On the margin question, yes, you're right. And when we gave our year end guidance, we said we anticipate our margins to likely look a lot like the full year 2020, as we began to kind of see the second half of 2020, really with the strength of the payer mix and acuity. So we're very pleased with where we stand with that. We'll continue to evaluate as the year goes on. But I think the balance of our guidance, I reflect back to our discussion at the end of the year. So the raise really is the consideration of the strong performance in the first quarter plus the continuation of the government support.\nSam Hazen: And Bill, this is Sam. Let me add one thing to that. I mentioned just a second ago that, I think we have a differentiated portfolio. And inside of that differentiation, we believe that the growth prospects for Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, Miami, Florida, places like that are much better than the national average. And so we continue to see job growth. The other thing, I would point to is that, the increase in enrollment through the exchanges is a very positive dynamic, and we see further opportunities for improvement in that particular dynamic as there's more money supporting navigation and other support for individuals who have lost their jobs. Our participation in exchange product has improved year-over-year and actually significantly improved over two, three, four years to where we have roughly 80% access to exchange lives across HCA markets today, which is quite different than what was maybe three, four years ago. So as more people get enrolled there, we think the support, and this is one of the things we've talked about in the past how does the Affordable Care Act provides support in a recessionary cycle, and it seems to be providing solid support. And as we look forward, that is an area that we find to be a positive dynamic as well.\nMark Kimbrough: Okay. Pito, thank you much. Kara?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Hey, Ralph.\nRalph Giacobbe: Hey, gents. So outpatient surgery, up 2.3% stands out. Maybe just what's driving that category to kind of buck the negative volume trends? And then I think, Sam, you mentioned 30% on the outpatient side in March. Obviously, that's a pretty hefty number. So just hoping you can give more detail on the categories there and maybe the impact of the influence of weather? I'm assuming some of that may be pulled forward from week of February, but any commentary on that would be helpful? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: All right. Thanks, Ralph. I think, obviously, the March this year had a favorable calendar. We had one more work day than we did last year. Last year, obviously, we shut down the company for the most part, midway through the month. But when we look at our March 2019, we saw activity levels that were consistent on a per business day. So the outpatient surgery activity in March of 2019 per business day was pretty much identical to the outpatient surgical volume per business day in 2021. It's probably a little bit of pull-through from February storms. But for the most part, we were up and operational in a week in the state of Texas, which was a remarkable feat on the part of our teams. And so I don't know exactly how much of that was storm related. It's hard to really pinpoint that. But we're seeing, obviously, a little migration from inpatient to outpatient, which has continued from one year to the next and that's influencing our outpatient statistics also. But when I look broadly across outpatient volumes, not just surgical, cardiac volume, very strong performance in electrophysiology on the cardiac side, recovery in endoscopic procedures on the outpatient side. So some of the diagnostic activity, which we believed had been deferred, it showed itself a little bit in March in ways that we hadn't seen maybe in other months in the latter part of 2020. So we're encouraged by that. As I mentioned in my comments, we're seeing some pull-through into April that\u2019s very similar. And we'll continue to monitor this and report out on it and give you a better feel as we get further into the year.\nMark Kimbrough: Thank you, Ralph.\nRalph Giacobbe: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Thanks a lot. So I just want to ask about two things as we're starting to move into a kind of post-COVID impacted period. Was interested in both what are you able to do from a capacity expansion standpoint kind of within facilities and within outpatient to accommodate more volumes, kind of the catch up on deferred care maybe for the second half of the year to understand how that capacity could expand?  And then just also interested in bad debt, how that's performed during this period? And any activities you've taken as far as kind of collection or other sort of processes to deal with that and how that looks going forward?\nSam Hazen: Okay. Let me take the first one. I'll kick the second one to Bill. I think with respect to capacity management, a couple of things. One, as I mentioned, we're investing to expand capacity where we believe appropriate both inpatient, outpatient, emergency room, whatever the case may be, we have a very sophisticated analytical methodology to determining where we have constraints and where do we have opportunities to relieve those constraints with investments and so forth. But the second thing I would say, and I think this is an important point, and it\u2019s a learning that we experienced during the COVID year, I'll call it, 2020 and the first part of this year. The ability to manage our capacity in order to deal with the different surges that we experienced required us to haul our discharge planning process and case management functions at time to create flexibility with the capacity that we do have. So if we were to see a spike in deferred care starting to show itself, I think the learnings operationally and from a capacity management standpoint, that we experienced and gained during the COVID surges will help us in responding to that particular situation. So those are the two approaches that we're doing to deal with potential growth in demand. And we still continue to believe that long-term health care demand is there. And it will be there in the future and our systems are durable and built for that as we continue to move through these different periods. Bill?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. On the bad debt and the uninsured, I think as we reported in the past, we've continued to see declines in our uninsured volume as the COVID pandemic began to show itself all throughout the last three quarters of last year, and that continues into the first quarter. And those uninsured declines were greater than our total. So some of that is also due to we are receiving some HRSA payments for some reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients. So all of those have resulted that our uncompensated care levels are actually below where we were running prior year. And we don't see any material developing trends in that category. So we're very pleased with where we stand relative to the bad debts and the uncompensated care position.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Lance.\nLance Wilkes: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Hey, Scott.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a follow-up question actually on just on the home health strategy. I'm interested if you guys had mentioned the interest statistic that you have around 250,000 patients to start annually directly into the home. Interested if you've been able to evaluate what percentage of those patients would be covered by the existing Brookdale Home Health footprint. And then as you think about markets where you have \u2013 don't have the overlap with Brookdale, whether you would look to scale up that asset or whether you would consider pursuing additional strategic relationships with other HH [ph] providers? Thanks.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Scott.\nSam Hazen: Yes. Scott, on the Brookdale, roughly 60% to 70% of their agencies have overlap in our markets. So obviously, that was an attractive strategic component of the acquisition. And as we work through the acquisition integration, we're going to explore that even further. Relative to agencies that reside in non-HCA markets, we'll still evaluate what is the appropriate course of action. And if there are partnership opportunities, we may pursue those, but we'll still take that and consider that as we go through the completion of the transaction.\nMark Kimbrough: Thanks, Scott. Kara?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. I guess my question for you, Sam, as we start seeing this pace of recovery, how are you thinking about remaining pent-up demand in the market? And then as we talked about payer mix earlier, what can you share with us in terms of the mix of patients you're seeing both on the kinds of procedures we're seeing, the recovery in March and April and the payer mix bucket that we're seeing? Is it shifting back to more Medicare, more uninsured, more Medicaid? I just want to see if you can give us some color on what the recovery looks like right now? Thank you.\nMark Kimbrough: All right, Brian. Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Well, I think it's still early to land on exactly what the recovery is looking like. If you look at the two elements of our business where we saw significant drop-off, pediatric activity on one side and then obviously, Medicare activity on the other. So the middle piece, if you want to call it that, is what has been most durable. Having said that, most of our outpatient business that was deferred is that middle piece. Some of the inpatient that we have lost is the outer shoulders, the pediatric and the Medicare side of the equation. So I don't really have a good sense of what's going to happen on the Medicare side. We're starting to see more pediatric activity in the month of March. It wasn't down as much as it was in previous periods, which reflects I think, kids going back to school in many communities, activity starting to happen again with spring sports and such and we're seeing a little bit more traffic in our emergency room related to pediatric volume. But I think on the outpatient side, which is where most of the deferred care, we believe was, that is largely a commercial book of business. 55% of our revenues or so on the outpatient side is commercial-related. And as that starts to develop, we think that will be probably what shows itself from the deferred care. But it's still early. Obviously, there's still uptake with vaccines. There's still concerns with COVID from one community to the other. And all of that could create some choppiness to it all, but we need a few more months to really judge exactly what that rebound is going to be, but we're encouraged again, by March. We're encouraged by the early view into April and we're hopeful that sustains itself over the remainder of this year.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake, Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Hey, thanks. Good morning.\nMark Kimbrough: Hi, Justin.\nJustin Lake: Hey. I\u2019m going to try to squeeze into quota [ph] numbers questions here, if that\u2019s, okay. First, given the meaningful shift in 2021 numbers, obviously, little positive. Wanted to ask about the right jumping off point going in 2022 in terms of moving parts. I mean, obviously, I could think of is just on sequestration is probably going to come back, maybe offset by some acquisition benefits, et cetera. So if you can run through that, that would be great. And then on the commercial mix shift, given how dramatic it's been. I was wondering if you have any ability to parse that out in terms of market share gains versus just the population shift in younger people moving south into your markets. And simply just less deferred care among commercial populations versus maybe Medicare? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Justin, I'll start with the first one. It's early for us to be thinking about the variables going into 2022 as we were just talking about trying to get a read on how the recovery period, if you will or how the business settles once COVID gets to a normalized level. So it's just a little early to think about the puts and takes of 2022. We don't have insight into government funding beyond this year at this stage. So give us another quarter or two. And then as we near the completion of the year, we'll be able to talk to you about our view of the trends we're seeing currently as far as how they roll into 2022.\nSam Hazen: And Justin, this is Sam. On the market share, we are operating at an all-time high on market share based upon the most currently available data we have, which is the end of the third quarter for 2020, and we're pushing the overall market share for the company across the 43 domestic markets into the low 27% zone. So very high watermark. On the commercial side of the equation, we have, in fact, gained market share on the commercial at an even faster pace. I don't know exactly how that's playing out in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter. But we have seen trends that are more positive for our company on that particular front and our overall trends. And I think that's been part of our results. And we continue to evolve our physician strategy, our service line strategies, our outreach strategies and so forth toward the commercial book of business as you would expect, and we believe it's yielding positive results for the company.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Justin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nMark Kimbrough: Hey, Josh.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks for taking the question. Just had a quick one on CapEx. It looks like CapEx was actually down almost $200 million year-over-year in the first quarter, even though you are guiding to considerably higher CapEx for the full year? So I was just wondering what caused that decline this quarter. And I wanted to see what the thinking was on how CapEx would ramp through the balance of 2021? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. We understand it was below. Some of that is the capital program starting. We're repopulating the pipeline with approvals. And so the spending of that you didn't see in the first quarter. We still believe that our capital spending will approximate this $3.7 billion, maybe a little bit on either side of that. And so we do anticipate the capital, the actual spend to ramp as we go throughout the year, and we'll just have to continue to evaluate that. So ultimately, I think what you're seeing in the first quarter is as we slowed down capital in 2020, as we began re-implementing some of our capital programs, just the spending didn't occur at that same level. But we still believe 3.7% is the right number here. Just timing on how the capital gets spent.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Josh. Even though, I don't think you are Josh.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.\nJohn Ransom: Hey. Good morning, team. I have an exciting opportunity for you. I'm going to ask two questions, and you can either answer both the quick ones. We'll catch-up on the other offline. So dealer's choice. So my first question is, if we look at your assumptions for the back half of the year, my hypothesis is that certainly, Medicare will grow faster than commercial, but both buckets, if we measure by adjusted admissions will grow just commercial at a lower rate. Is that consistent with your assumptions? And my second question is what is \u2013 what are your top two or three public policy priorities in D.C. given the new administration? I'll stop there. Thank you.\nSam Hazen: Yes. John, let me take the first one. Our assumptions throughout the year just consistent with our year end is that we do expect a recovery of our historical business to return. As we see COVID settle to a level, as we hope broader populations get vaccinated, that we'll begin to see this return. So we do expect some growth to occur from where we are now as we go through the year. And I think that is reflected in our full year guidance. The exact timing and the pacing of that is unclear. But we do expect throughout the year, there will be a recovery, and we'll return to some historical level of pattern for us. And that would likely occur through all payer classes in Medicare as well as the commercial as we've talked about.\nBill Rutherford: And we're going to play both of your cards. So the question around ...\nJohn Ransom: Just like a dream come true through.\nBill Rutherford: Just for you, John, just for you. You should have asked great question. On the public policy front, I think, obviously, we're focused in on health policy. And it's our belief that the Affordable Care Act is providing the support for the country that it was intended to do, and we're hopeful that we can maintain policies that provide that kind of protection for people so they have the coverage and access they need. And then the second area would be around tax policy. Obviously, we're a tax paying healthcare system as compared to many of our competitors who aren't and paying and focusing in on getting to the right tax policy is important to us. Those are the two categories that we're focused on.\nJohn Ransom: Thank you.\nMark Kimbrough: All right, John. Have fun at the golf course.\nJohn Ransom: Not today, my course is closed.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.\nMark Kimbrough: Hey, Jamie.\nJamie Perse: Hey, good morning. You mentioned the March trends and that continuing into in April. I wanted to clarify, does that mean the volume levels were similar in March and heading into April or that the recovery curve is progressing in April. And then more forward looking, just what leading indicators do you look at, whether it's primary care utilization or non-COVID diagnostic trends that might give us some color on where volumes might go from here?\nSam Hazen: I think for the comment around April is a general observation about our business as a whole. And some of the aspects of our March activity and results is carrying forward into April. That's really all I'm going to say at this particular point in time. What was the second question again?\nMark Kimbrough: Leading indicators?\nSam Hazen: Okay. We use our physician practices as a source of leading indicators, if you will. And we're starting to see new patient activity grow. I want to say, in the month of March, new patient activity, some of this is business day driven was up 17% over the previous year. And that's a pretty significant indicator of future activity. That occurred across a variety of specialties. We employ roughly 7,500 to 8,000 physicians. And so we're seeing activity within new patient rosters and new patient activity show up in our clinics. And as I mentioned also, our emergency room activity has started to grow a little bit from where it was in the low point in 2020 and during the COVID periods. So those are two leading indicators that I would suggest are indicative of maybe more activity starting to percolate in the markets.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Jamie. Kara?\nOperator: And there are no more questions at this time.\nMark Kimbrough: All right. Well, listen, we want to thank everyone for joining the call today. As always, feel free to call, if there are additional questions that you might have. But have a safe day. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Sam spoke to many of our operating metrics and results. So I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter. Then review our updated 2021 guidance. As a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.99 billion, as compared to $1.375 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Capital spending for the quarter was $654 million, and we completed just over $1.5 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. We have approximately $7.3 billion remaining on our authorization. And consistent with our year end discussion, we are planning on completing the majority of this in 2021, subject to market conditions. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.85 times, and we had approximately $5.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2021 guidance as follows. We expect revenue to range between $54 billion and $55.5 billion. We expect full year EBITDA to range between $10.85 billion and $11.35 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $13.30 and $14.30 and our capital spending target remains at approximately $3.7 billion. Our revised guidance considers the strong results in the first quarter and also considers the extension of the public health emergency and the deferral of sequestration reductions through the end of the year. In summary, we recognize some uncertainties remain as we go through the balance of the year, but we are confident in the company's ability to manage through various business cycles, and we are well positioned to continue to invest capital to capture growth opportunities and execute on acquisition opportunities if they become available. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark and then open up for Q&A. Thanks, Kevin. Kevin, let me answer that. First, you're right. The acquisitions for the balance of the year are not included in our expectations, but we don't expect that material contribution from those \u2013 for this year. Relative to our increase in guidance, largely due to the strong performance that we had in the first quarter is the driver of that. As Sam talked, we have some insight into March and the read-through through April. And then we did consider the continuation of the deferral of sequestration through the balance of the year. And we know the public health emergency got extended at least through 90 days through July. So the majority of the guidance range is a result of our performance from the first quarter and considers the extension of the sequestration on there. So, as we've talked about at our year-end call, there's still variables out there, but the way we're reading the environment right now is generally positive. Yes. Frank, this is Bill. I'll start. I think the margin is primarily attributable to the top line with the revenue and the acuity and the payer mix that we had. But we continue to be focused on looking for efficiencies throughout the company, as we've talked about our resiliency plans in the past. And so those efforts continue, and many of them are well underway in almost every category. And so that is a part of the performance of the company. But the margins clearly are being helped by both the acuity and the payer mix and the revenue per adjusted admission that we're seeing. But as we've talked about multiple times, we are continuing to look for as much efficiency as we can as we go through different cycles. And many of those efforts continue to be underway. Yes, Pito, so this is Bill. Let me try to zero in on that. As I answered Kevin's, majority was due to the strong performance. We understand we beat our expectations and depending on your number anywhere from $300 million to $400 million that we expected the first half of the year to be stronger than the second half, but it still outpaced our expectations. The sequestration extension for the end of the year is probably worth anywhere from $40 million to $50 million a quarter. So that added \u2013 we originally did not anticipate that continuing past the first quarter. So that's an element of the raise, too. So if you look at the midpoint, our raise was $500 million. You could say, it's probably $350 million to $400 million from our performance and then the balance through these government extensions, if you want to have specifics on that. But we also have a range with variables that are \u2013 that continue to play out. On the margin question, yes, you're right. And when we gave our year end guidance, we said we anticipate our margins to likely look a lot like the full year 2020, as we began to kind of see the second half of 2020, really with the strength of the payer mix and acuity. So we're very pleased with where we stand with that. We'll continue to evaluate as the year goes on. But I think the balance of our guidance, I reflect back to our discussion at the end of the year. So the raise really is the consideration of the strong performance in the first quarter plus the continuation of the government support. Yes. On the bad debt and the uninsured, I think as we reported in the past, we've continued to see declines in our uninsured volume as the COVID pandemic began to show itself all throughout the last three quarters of last year, and that continues into the first quarter. And those uninsured declines were greater than our total. So some of that is also due to we are receiving some HRSA payments for some reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients. So all of those have resulted that our uncompensated care levels are actually below where we were running prior year. And we don't see any material developing trends in that category. So we're very pleased with where we stand relative to the bad debts and the uncompensated care position. Justin, I'll start with the first one. It's early for us to be thinking about the variables going into 2022 as we were just talking about trying to get a read on how the recovery period, if you will or how the business settles once COVID gets to a normalized level. So it's just a little early to think about the puts and takes of 2022. We don't have insight into government funding beyond this year at this stage. So give us another quarter or two. And then as we near the completion of the year, we'll be able to talk to you about our view of the trends we're seeing currently as far as how they roll into 2022. Yes. This is Bill. We understand it was below. Some of that is the capital program starting. We're repopulating the pipeline with approvals. And so the spending of that you didn't see in the first quarter. We still believe that our capital spending will approximate this $3.7 billion, maybe a little bit on either side of that. And so we do anticipate the capital, the actual spend to ramp as we go throughout the year, and we'll just have to continue to evaluate that. So ultimately, I think what you're seeing in the first quarter is as we slowed down capital in 2020, as we began re-implementing some of our capital programs, just the spending didn't occur at that same level. But we still believe 3.7% is the right number here. Just timing on how the capital gets spent. And we're going to play both of your cards. So the question around ... Just for you, John, just for you. You should have asked great question. On the public policy front, I think, obviously, we're focused in on health policy. And it's our belief that the Affordable Care Act is providing the support for the country that it was intended to do, and we're hopeful that we can maintain policies that provide that kind of protection for people so they have the coverage and access they need. And then the second area would be around tax policy. Obviously, we're a tax paying healthcare system as compared to many of our competitors who aren't and paying and focusing in on getting to the right tax policy is important to us. Those are the two categories that we're focused on."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge, we started the year with strong financial results in the first quarter. The results were driven by better-than-expected revenue growth and improved operating margins. Revenues grew over $1.1 billion, or 8.7% as compared to the prior year. This growth was generated by highly acute inpatient volumes, better payer mix, and a rebound in surgical and outpatient volumes in March. Generally speaking, March trends are continuing into April. Inpatient revenues increased by 12%. The acuity within our inpatient business was higher as reflected in both the case mix index, which increased 7% and length of stay which grew by 6%. Additionally, commercial admits inside of our domestic operations represented 29% of total admits, compared to 26.5% last year. Commercial payer mix has been consistently around this level for the past four quarters. These two factors combined explain the 17% increase in inpatient revenue per admissions. The total - the total admits were down 4.2% year-over-year. In comparison to 2019, admits were down approximately 3%, which was - which was in line with our expectations. In the quarter, we treated almost 50,000 COVID-19 inpatients, which represented 10% of total admissions. Throughout the quarter, the percentage of COVID-19 admits to total admits declined. January with 17%, February was 8%, and March was down to almost 5%. Outpatient revenues increased 4.7% as compared to prior year. This result is better performance than the previous two quarters in which outpatient revenue was down approximately 5%. Outpatient revenues declined in January and February, consistent with that trend. But March, which had one additional weekday this year, increased by 30% as outpatient surgery and other procedures recovered strongly. Same facility outpatient surgery volumes grew 2.3% as compared to last year. As compared to 2019, they declined 3%. E.R. visits declined 18%. This decrease is generally consistent with the trends we experienced in the previous two quarters. E.R. visits were down 19% compared to 2019. Our teams continue to focus and deliver on our operating agenda. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the company grew on a year-over-year basis and was consistent on a sequential basis with the prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales, as well as losses on debt retirement, increase 78% to $4.14. During the quarter, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in the home health and hospitals business of Brookdale Senior Living. This business provides us with a large platform that complements our local provider systems. It will expand the services we offer across our networks and provide us with more enterprise capabilities to coordinate care for our patients and improve their experiences. Additionally, we believe the home will become a more important setting for healthcare in the future with continuing growth and demand. We anticipate this transaction will close in the third quarter and we look forward to our new partnership with Brookdale. Also during the quarter, we opened two new hospitals, one in Denver and one in Orlando. Each of these hospitals will strengthen our system offerings in these communities. In the second quarter, we expect to close on the acquisitions of two small hospitals both of which complement our networks in Nashville and Savannah. And lastly, we continue to invest broadly across our networks to improve convenience, access, and value for patients by developing more outpatient facilities. The pipeline for development and acquisition in this category remains strong. As we look to the rest of the year, we have increased our annual guidance to reflect the first quarter's performance and better perspective on important macro factors. Mainly, governmental reimbursement and economic outlooks for our markets, including uninsured assumptions. Bill will provide more details on our guidance in his comments. The first quarter is yet another period where the disciplined operating culture and strong execution by our teams were on display. I want to thank our 275,000 colleagues and 50,000 physicians for their tremendous work. We could not have performed at this level without their unwavering commitment to our patients and the communities we serve. As we continue to resource and execute on our strategic agenda, we will remain true to our mission of improving lives and delivering on the responsibilities we have to all our stakeholders. And now, I turn the call over to Bill. Bill, if I can just add to that. Our cost per adjusted patient day was in line with our expectations and actually slightly underneath that. And so we were only seeing in the face of really a difficult labor market, 3% growth in cost per adjusted patient day. So I think, it's a combination of both, but obviously, with the mix, that helps, Frank. Hey, A.J. Okay. A.J., this is Sam. I'll try to respond to those. I remember all the elements. On post-acute, let me speak to that. Obviously, home care opportunity and hospice opportunity to us, we believe, is a significant expansion of the services we offer. And the opportunities for integrating those patients who are discharged and we discharge about 250,000 patients a year into home care creates an opportunity for us to coordinate care better, stay connected to the patient after they leave our facilities and ultimately integrate them more effectively in the HCA Healthcare system. So we see a nice broad opportunity. We believe home care provides multiple channels of value for us, some of which are in the discharges that we talked about, some of it's in better case management and discharge planning and some of it is staying connected to the patient when they repurchase healthcare. Also on post-acute, we mentioned before because of the CON relaxation in Florida, we have made a large commitment to inpatient rehabilitation facilities in the state of Florida, where we have the greatest opportunity to do the same thing with rehab. So we've invested somewhere between $250 million and $300 million or we are investing rather in developing rehab services in the state of Florida, which will expand the offerings in those markets to our patients and support our systems. So we still see potential in both of those areas to expand into more significant relationships with Medicare Advantage payers potentially on post-acute, so it creates opportunities for us in multiple ways.  As it relates to our capital spending, as we mentioned in our guidance for 2021, we are increasing our capital budget to somewhere around $3.7 billion. Much of that increase is related to growth projects where we are expanding at facilities where we need to expand. We're still running the company north of 70% inpatient occupancy, and many of our facilities are north of that. And so in order for us to capitalize on this differentiated portfolio we have, where we believe our markets have unique growth prospects because of great economies, population growth and so forth, we need to create capacity both on the inpatient in certain circumstances and build out the networks additionally with outpatient facilities as we mentioned. With respect to ER specifically, we do see ample supply, generally speaking, with our ER beds today. We will have some continued investments in emergency room supply and capacity across certain markets because, number one, in some cases, we need it. We continue to operate at high levels, or two, we have freestanding emergency room opportunities. And we will invest in those, but they're not nearly as significant as they were five years ago when we were investing more heavily in that. So that flexibility will allow us to invest in ambulatory surgery centers, where we have a tremendously strong pipeline for new development. I think we have 10 or 12 new ambulatory surgery centers that are under development. We have a robust pipeline in that particular category as well. And then we will also invest in urgent care, recognizing that, that continues to serve a role in building out the capabilities inside of our markets. As it pertains to M&A, I do think there are going to be opportunities. As we've mentioned in the past, they come when they come. It's hard for us to predict. We are fortunate to have a balance sheet that can take advantage of those opportunities as presented. We have an enterprise chassis, if you will, that is built to be bigger and to bolt-on new opportunities and create synergies and value inside of those systems. And so we will continue to look for those as they develop and hopefully find opportunities that make sense for us. Thank you. Yes. And Bill, this is Sam. Let me add one thing to that. I mentioned just a second ago that, I think we have a differentiated portfolio. And inside of that differentiation, we believe that the growth prospects for Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, Miami, Florida, places like that are much better than the national average. And so we continue to see job growth. The other thing, I would point to is that, the increase in enrollment through the exchanges is a very positive dynamic, and we see further opportunities for improvement in that particular dynamic as there's more money supporting navigation and other support for individuals who have lost their jobs. Our participation in exchange product has improved year-over-year and actually significantly improved over two, three, four years to where we have roughly 80% access to exchange lives across HCA markets today, which is quite different than what was maybe three, four years ago. So as more people get enrolled there, we think the support, and this is one of the things we've talked about in the past how does the Affordable Care Act provides support in a recessionary cycle, and it seems to be providing solid support. And as we look forward, that is an area that we find to be a positive dynamic as well. All right. Thanks, Ralph. I think, obviously, the March this year had a favorable calendar. We had one more work day than we did last year. Last year, obviously, we shut down the company for the most part, midway through the month. But when we look at our March 2019, we saw activity levels that were consistent on a per business day. So the outpatient surgery activity in March of 2019 per business day was pretty much identical to the outpatient surgical volume per business day in 2021. It's probably a little bit of pull-through from February storms. But for the most part, we were up and operational in a week in the state of Texas, which was a remarkable feat on the part of our teams. And so I don't know exactly how much of that was storm related. It's hard to really pinpoint that. But we're seeing, obviously, a little migration from inpatient to outpatient, which has continued from one year to the next and that's influencing our outpatient statistics also. But when I look broadly across outpatient volumes, not just surgical, cardiac volume, very strong performance in electrophysiology on the cardiac side, recovery in endoscopic procedures on the outpatient side. So some of the diagnostic activity, which we believed had been deferred, it showed itself a little bit in March in ways that we hadn't seen maybe in other months in the latter part of 2020. So we're encouraged by that. As I mentioned in my comments, we're seeing some pull-through into April that's very similar. And we'll continue to monitor this and report out on it and give you a better feel as we get further into the year. Okay. Let me take the first one. I'll kick the second one to Bill. I think with respect to capacity management, a couple of things. One, as I mentioned, we're investing to expand capacity where we believe appropriate both inpatient, outpatient, emergency room, whatever the case may be, we have a very sophisticated analytical methodology to determining where we have constraints and where do we have opportunities to relieve those constraints with investments and so forth. But the second thing I would say, and I think this is an important point, and it's a learning that we experienced during the COVID year, I'll call it, 2020 and the first part of this year. The ability to manage our capacity in order to deal with the different surges that we experienced required us to haul our discharge planning process and case management functions at time to create flexibility with the capacity that we do have. So if we were to see a spike in deferred care starting to show itself, I think the learnings operationally and from a capacity management standpoint, that we experienced and gained during the COVID surges will help us in responding to that particular situation. So those are the two approaches that we're doing to deal with potential growth in demand. And we still continue to believe that long-term health care demand is there. And it will be there in the future and our systems are durable and built for that as we continue to move through these different periods. Bill? Yes. Scott, on the Brookdale, roughly 60% to 70% of their agencies have overlap in our markets. So obviously, that was an attractive strategic component of the acquisition. And as we work through the acquisition integration, we're going to explore that even further. Relative to agencies that reside in non-HCA markets, we'll still evaluate what is the appropriate course of action. And if there are partnership opportunities, we may pursue those, but we'll still take that and consider that as we go through the completion of the transaction. Well, I think it's still early to land on exactly what the recovery is looking like. If you look at the two elements of our business where we saw significant drop-off, pediatric activity on one side and then obviously, Medicare activity on the other. So the middle piece, if you want to call it that, is what has been most durable. Having said that, most of our outpatient business that was deferred is that middle piece. Some of the inpatient that we have lost is the outer shoulders, the pediatric and the Medicare side of the equation. So I don't really have a good sense of what's going to happen on the Medicare side. We're starting to see more pediatric activity in the month of March. It wasn't down as much as it was in previous periods, which reflects I think, kids going back to school in many communities, activity starting to happen again with spring sports and such and we're seeing a little bit more traffic in our emergency room related to pediatric volume. But I think on the outpatient side, which is where most of the deferred care, we believe was, that is largely a commercial book of business. 55% of our revenues or so on the outpatient side is commercial-related. And as that starts to develop, we think that will be probably what shows itself from the deferred care. But it's still early. Obviously, there's still uptake with vaccines. There's still concerns with COVID from one community to the other. And all of that could create some choppiness to it all, but we need a few more months to really judge exactly what that rebound is going to be, but we're encouraged again, by March. We're encouraged by the early view into April and we're hopeful that sustains itself over the remainder of this year. And Justin, this is Sam. On the market share, we are operating at an all-time high on market share based upon the most currently available data we have, which is the end of the third quarter for 2020, and we're pushing the overall market share for the company across the 43 domestic markets into the low 27% zone. So very high watermark. On the commercial side of the equation, we have, in fact, gained market share on the commercial at an even faster pace. I don't know exactly how that's playing out in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter. But we have seen trends that are more positive for our company on that particular front and our overall trends. And I think that's been part of our results. And we continue to evolve our physician strategy, our service line strategies, our outreach strategies and so forth toward the commercial book of business as you would expect, and we believe it's yielding positive results for the company. Yes. John, let me take the first one. Our assumptions throughout the year just consistent with our year end is that we do expect a recovery of our historical business to return. As we see COVID settle to a level, as we hope broader populations get vaccinated, that we'll begin to see this return. So we do expect some growth to occur from where we are now as we go through the year. And I think that is reflected in our full year guidance. The exact timing and the pacing of that is unclear. But we do expect throughout the year, there will be a recovery, and we'll return to some historical level of pattern for us. And that would likely occur through all payer classes in Medicare as well as the commercial as we've talked about. I think for the comment around April is a general observation about our business as a whole. And some of the aspects of our March activity and results is carrying forward into April. That's really all I'm going to say at this particular point in time. What was the second question again? Okay. We use our physician practices as a source of leading indicators, if you will. And we're starting to see new patient activity grow. I want to say, in the month of March, new patient activity, some of this is business day driven was up 17% over the previous year. And that's a pretty significant indicator of future activity. That occurred across a variety of specialties. We employ roughly 7,500 to 8,000 physicians. And so we're seeing activity within new patient rosters and new patient activity show up in our clinics. And as I mentioned also, our emergency room activity has started to grow a little bit from where it was in the low point in 2020 and during the COVID periods. So those are two leading indicators that I would suggest are indicative of maybe more activity starting to percolate in the markets."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the HCA Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we will take a few questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today\u2019s call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today\u2019s press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning\u2019s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today\u2019s release. This morning\u2019s call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Alright. Good morning and thank you for joining the call. We finished 2022 as expected with pre-pandemic seasonality demand norms driving solid volume growth. Additionally, we continue to see progress with our labor agenda. These factors helped produce solid earnings in the fourth quarter that were consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged by this outcome and believe this operational momentum should position us well for 2023. 2022 was a tale of two halves, with the first half being more about winding down from the previous 2 years of intense COVID activity and responding to the resulting challenges. The second half was more about normalization, which included strong demand and an improving labor market. Once again, I believe our people have demonstrated an impressive capability in the face of these dynamic forces and delivered for our patients, the communities we serve and other stakeholders. Healthcare people in general are unique, but I believe HCA Healthcare people are even more special. I\u2019ll often refer to them as can-do people, and again, this past year, I think they proved it. I want to thank them for their hard work and everything they do each and everyday for our company. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong in the fourth quarter. Admissions grew 3% year-over-year. Non-COVID admissions increased in excess of 5%. Equivalent admissions were up 5.4%, with impressive growth of 11% in the emergency room. Most of our other volume categories had solid growth metrics in the quarter also. The payer mix and acuity levels in the quarter remained at favorable levels. These factors produced revenue growth against a difficult comparison of 3% in the quarter. With respect to our people agenda, we were pleased with the improvements we saw in key metrics. Turnover numbers for registered nurses were down 26% in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous four quarters\u2019 average. Our turnover rate is still higher than we want, but we believe it is better than the industry average. Employee engagement scores recovered to around pre-pandemic levels. Again, our engagement is above the industry average. Our recruiting teams continue to generate results for the company. Hiring increased 6% year-over-year in 2022. And lastly, we opened our seventh Galan College of Nursing School this year. With respect to labor costs during the quarter, we experienced stable labor cost per hour with utilization of contract labor declining. As we have detailed in the past, we have implemented a robust human resources plan. We executed well on it and expect to make further progress as we move into 2023. It remains a top organizational priority. Even with the progress, we continued this quarter to experience capacity constraints, creating situations where we were unable to deliver services in certain situations. Also in the quarter, we saw value from our portfolio optimization plan and closed two joint ventures with strategic partners; one was with our Sarah Cannon Research Institute, which we combined with McKesson\u2019s cancer research entity. We believe the combination of these two entities will produce better cancer research and more clinical trials across the country, providing even more community-based resources for physicians and patients to fight this disease. The second co-venture is with our CoreTrust purchasing organization. We closed on a new partnership with Blackstone. We believe this new relationship can expand our ability to offer commercial purchasing and services solutions to a broader variety of customers. We believe both of these deals achieved our strategic objectives and connected us with better platforms for success in the future. We are excited to partner with both entities. We also implemented our capital plan for the year as expected, including redeploying the proceeds from these two new joint ventures. Bill will provide more details in his comments. And finally, we announced in the last quarter a significant leadership transition that we believe will position the organization better with responding timelier to market dynamics, while also strengthening the alignment of corporate functions to our strategy. The executives who are part of this transition are all proven HCA executives, they understand and appreciate our culture and they know how to execute. As we push ahead into 2023 and beyond, we believe the strong demand for healthcare services presents opportunity for HCA Healthcare in an otherwise challenging macro environment. We believe the company is well-positioned culturally, competitively and financially to capitalize. Our agenda next year will be focused on the following three areas. First, overcoming labor and capacity challenges. Again, we believe we have the appropriate initiatives in place to respond to these. Second, counter inflationary pressures. Again, we have numerous efforts in place to contend with these forces, while ensuring we continue to deliver high-quality outcomes to our patients. And third, accelerating growth with our winning plays. This agenda continues to leverage capital investments in outpatient facilities, clinical equipment for our physicians and service line expansion. On top of our 2023 agenda, we are also making investments in our long-term plan, which includes four primary elements: the first one is advancing our clinical systems and digital capabilities; second is transforming care models with innovative solutions; third is expanding our workforce development programs; and fourth, is investing capital in our networks to expand their offerings. These efforts are pressuring our results some in the current year, but we believe they are necessary in creating a platform for ultimately optimizing our networks so they can deliver even better patient care in the future. Let me close with this. The last 3 years have been an extraordinary experience for everyone at HCA Healthcare. There has been no rest nor retreat for our people and it was truly a challenge like no other. I strongly believe however that our Board, our management teams and our caregivers have shined through it all. We went into the pandemic with two priorities, to protect our people and to protect the organization so we could continue providing high-quality healthcare to the communities we serve. I believe strongly that we showed up, we delivered on these priorities and we did it the right way. I am proud of HCA Healthcare and I am even more proud of our people. The future for our company is even brighter because of the past 3 years and what we learned. Now we will move into 2023 and the years ahead with greater purpose, with a renewed agenda to drive growth and with more confidence in our ability to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn the call to Bill and he will discuss the quarter\u2019s results in more detail and our 2023 guidance.\nBill Rutherford: Okay. Thank you, Sam and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter and the year then discuss our \u201823 guidance. We finished the year with good volume metrics. Our fourth quarter same facility admissions increased 2.9% over the prior year. For the full year, our same-facility admissions were up 0.5%. Excluding COVID admissions, our same-facility admissions grew 5.4% in the quarter and were up 3.4% for the year. For the full year, COVID admissions accounted for 5.2% of our admissions versus 7.8% in the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 11.4% in the quarter as compared to the prior year and were up 7.6% for the full year. Our same-facility outpatient surgeries were up slightly in the quarter from the prior year, but increased 5.6% sequentially compared to the third quarter. Same-facility inpatient surgeries were basically flat as compared to the prior year. Both were impacted by 1 less business day in the quarter. Our same-facility revenue per equivalent admission was down 2.6% in the quarter from the prior year as this was influenced by the drop in COVID activity. Sequentially, our non-COVID revenue per equivalent admission increased approximately 3.7% as compared to the third quarter. Our case mix increased just under 2% sequentially from the third quarter and our payer mix remained stable as well. We remain pleased with our team\u2019s management of operating costs even with the backdrop of higher inflation rates. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins were 20.5% in the quarter and right at 20% for the full year. We continue to focus on our labor plans and supporting our teams, while appropriately managing contract labor and premium pay programs. Our total labor cost as a percentage of revenue improved both sequentially and when compared to the prior year. In addition, our supply cost trends have remained very consistent during the year and we are pleased with these results. Other operating expenses have been subject to some inflationary cost pressures when compared to the prior year, but has run fairly consistent as a percent of revenue throughout 2022. Our cash flow and capital allocation are a key part of our long-term growth and value-creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion in 2022. Our capital spending was just under $4.4 billion for the year, which was slightly higher than our initial expectations due to some year end real estate and information technology purchases. We paid dividends of about $650 million and we repurchased $7 billion of our outstanding stock during the year. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3x to 4x. For full year 2022, we realized approximately $1.2 billion in proceeds from sales of facilities and healthcare entities. So, let me speak to our 2023 guidance for a moment. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year \u201823 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $61.5 billion and $63.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.525 billion and $4.895 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $16.40 and $17.60. And we expect capital spending to approximate $4.3 billion during the year. So, let me provide some additional commentary on our guidance. Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance is impacted by several governmental and policy changes. In 2022, we recognized approximately $280 million in COVID support mainly from DRG add-ons, removal of sequestration cuts and HRSA reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients. We expect very little revenue from these programs in 2023. Also, as discussed in our first quarter release, we recognized $244 million of revenues and $90 million of expenses related to the Texas directed payment program that was for the last 4 months of 2021. This program that started on September 1, \u201821 was not improved until the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we estimate the impact of the 340B related payment reductions to be between $50 million and $100 million. Adjusted for these items, the midpoint of our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance would be in the middle of our historical 4% to 6% growth expectations that we have had over time. Within our guidance, we expect our same facility equivalent admissions to grow approximately 2% to 3% and our revenue per equivalent admission to grow approximately 2%. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3.1 billion and interest expense is projected to be around $1.975 billion. Interest expense will be impacted by both higher rates and anticipated draws under our revolving credit facilities. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be about $278 million for the full year and cash flow from operations is estimated to range between $8.5 billion and $9 billion. Also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program. This will be in addition to the approximate $1.5 billion remaining authorization we had under the previous program at the end of the year. In addition, our Board has declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.56 to $0.60 per share. With that, I will turn the call over to Frank and we will open it up for Q&A.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. [Operator Instructions] Devin, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of numbers questions here. I appreciate all the detail you have given. So first, just all thinking about 2023, can you talk us a little bit about what you are expecting for labor expense and maybe delineate the cost on permanent labor versus hopefully the downward trend maybe give us \u201822 versus \u201823 million on labor? And then couple of things, exchanges and redetermination, right, exchange growth has been big redeterminations could be a tailwind at least according to our estimates. Curious what you have assumed there on payer mix and kind of impacts from that on 2023 guide as well? Thanks guys.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Justin, this is Bill. Let me start. So as it relates to labor cost, I think as a percentage of revenue, we will keep it on an as-reported basis, flat with where we ran for the full year of this year. We continue to expect improvement in the utilization and cost of contract labor as we go through the balance of the year. And so I think that\u2019s a good output for us. Relative to payer mix, we think payer mix for now will mostly remain stable. We are encouraged with what we are seeing with the enrollment in the health insurance exchanges and we believe the enrollment in our states, are probably a little bit higher than what we see as a nation. And so we think we have contemplated that within the context of our overall range, but we are encouraged with some of the payer mix trends.\nOperator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the outlook commentary and so forth. Maybe because you have got about a $600 million range on the EBITDA range you are looking at. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what are some of the swing factors? Do you see those mainly as top line swing factors that would get you to the high or low end or is there expense management, open questions in your mind? And specifically on the labor, you have got quite a bit of a decline in the contract labor from what you spent in \u201822 versus presumably the run-rate for \u201823. How much of that are you baking into the guidance versus how much are you saying you have got to redeploy to support permanent labor?\nSam Hazen: A.J., this is Sam. I think on the guidance, I mean, we have got 2.5%, I believe, on either side of the midpoint. The top side of that range I think is achievable if our volume and labor agenda happens maybe a little bit better than what we anticipate. The low side of that range would be greater inflationary pressures and maybe some more challenges in a tenuous labor market. Those are sort of the big variables, if you will, in the equation. I mean, it\u2019s a fairly big number to begin with and again, the 2.5% range on either side of the midpoint we think is not unreasonable. So to consider it to be very wide seems maybe to not fully appreciate some of the variables inside of it. With respect to labor, yes, we have made significant investments in our people. We did that throughout last year mainly in the late summer, early fall, where we adjusted our wages to deal with movement in the market resulting from some visibility that we had with our overall competitive positioning. Some of the contract labor reductions that we expect and have already made even will be absorbed a little bit in those decisions, but we think the net of it is what Bill just alluded to, and that is that we can maintain our labor cost as a percent of revenue roughly around what we finished 2022 at. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. And again, we\u2019re seeing positive metrics across the key dimensions of our labor agenda that is encouraging to us. And we believe we have more room to gain with our agenda, and we\u2019re hopeful that, that will continue throughout 2023.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Two quick ones for me. Bill, I know you said contract labor came down again, but I didn\u2019t catch if you disclosed the 4Q number. And then my other one was just also on your comment about the other OpEx line. I mean that\u2019s still a line that on a per adjusted patient day basis is up in the double digits. So any help you can give us on thinking about modeling that for \u201823?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Gary. On contract labor for the quarter, we were down about 16% from where we ran in the fourth quarter of last year. So good improvement in that area. It represented roughly 7.8% of our total salary wages and benefits. We talked about given that number before. So again, solid trends in the fourth of this year compared to where we ran last year and especially where we ran in the first half of the year. Our other operating expenses, you\u2019re right, are subject to some of the general inflationary increases that we\u2019re seeing across the economy. When we think about utilities and insurance and, in addition, our professional fees areas, we\u2019re seeing some higher single-digit cost growth in other operating expenses. Fortunately, if you look across the quarters for 2022, as a percentage of revenue, you\u2019ll see our other operating expenses as a percent of revenue staying relatively and pretty consistent throughout the year. As we look forward to 2023, we do believe that\u2019s an area that can continue to see some higher single-digit inflationary pressures, and we factored that in to our guidance going forward. Again, we think labor supplies will keep in line and hopefully below where our revenue growth is. But the other operating cost area is around utilities, insurance pro fees are going to continue to see some pressures, and we factor that into our guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.\nBen Hendrix: Hi, good morning. Thank you. With regard to capacity constraints, you mentioned last quarter missing out on 1% to 1.5% of total admissions in 3Q. Can you give us an update on where that stands now? And then maybe some more commentary on progress with your HR and case management initiatives and then the degree to which you expect those to help ease constraints and support your guidance this year? Thank you.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. Thank you for that. I mean we did, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, had some moments in the quarter where we were unable to receive transfers in or take certain patients into our facilities. And that was actually a little bit elevated over the third quarter. We had roughly, using this as the proxy, approximately 2% of our total admissions we were unable to take through our transfer centers and ahead to find those patients alternative solutions where we could. We were busier in the fourth quarter than we were in the third quarter, so that was part of it. But nonetheless, we still are seeing opportunities for us to improve the throughput through our case management initiatives, as you spoke to, continue to increase the head count in our facilities in order to take care of these patients. And we\u2019re hopeful that those numbers will start to come down a little bit as we push into 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with SVB Securities.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Sam, I wanted to go back to the long-term plan that you mentioned. You talked about advancing the transformation of care delivery models. Can you maybe elaborate more on that, sort of how that may be playing in the physician strategy, maybe a different view into working with MA plans or anything would be helpful? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Well, let me give you a little bit of a backdrop on our long-term thinking with in \u2013 and I think this going to help you understand why we are investing in these categories. First and foremost, we think we have just an incredible portfolio of communities that we serve. They are growing in and of themselves. So we have opportunities to invest in that growth. We think demand is going to grow in our markets. Aging baby boomers population growth chronic conditions, all those things unfortunately produce demand in some respect. And we think our portfolio is a little better than the national averages on that front. So we\u2019ve got that as a backdrop. So there is opportunities, I\u2019ll call it, outside the walls of HCA to invest in that natural growth in demand. The second piece that we believe exists is opportunities inside of HCA. We have what we call an economy of opportunities that exist across our 180 hospitals and 2,400 outpatient facilities that we have. And that opportunity is to use big data, use better clinical system capability and better analytics to support better care. And so our technology agenda, coupled with our care transformation agenda, is really about tapping into the economy of opportunity that exist inside our organization. So we think we have two sets of opportunities, outside to continue to grow market share and benefit from the growth in our markets, and then continued improvement in care delivery for better patient outcomes, more efficiency, better operational management in our hospitals by infusing machine learning, advanced analytics with our care transformation agenda. So our care transformation team is led by a physician and a clinical team with industrial engineers and other type of people who are big data analysts who are supporting evaluating great performance that we have inside our company and really studying the processes around those, or looking outside the company for better processes, better technologies, and, again, weaving that into our overall agenda for our long run. And we\u2019re encouraged by that. We have a major initiative that we\u2019re rolling out this year in our obstetrics unit, and we\u2019re excited about the possibilities around that. On our clinical systems, we are actually in our alpha pilot on our clinical system upgrades. We will have a beta pilot later this year. This is a system that we will be able to push more information, standardized information into the cloud and start to turn that into actionable insights that, we believe, can help our patient outcomes. So we\u2019re really excited about our long-run agenda. And again, it\u2019s geared toward better patient care, but capitalizing on the opportunities inside the walls of HCA.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Focusing on the fourth quarter, you talked about 2% lower emissions via the transfers. Were those all surgeries? I\u2019m just trying to understand why in-patient surgeries are so weak on easy comps, and why I didn\u2019t see a bigger increase in outpatient surgeries. We\u2019ve seen some med-tech companies report very strong U.S. surgical growth. So just trying to understand the delta? And also what are you seeing you grow in-patient surgeries and out-patient surgeries in 2023? Thanks so much.\nBill Rutherford: So Peter, this is Bill. I think our surgical volume, the most \u2013 the thing being pushed out was we had 1 less business day, 1 less surgical day, and so that could account for 1.5 points or 2 of that trend. And I don\u2019t think there is any other trends that we observed in our out-patient or in-patient surgery or call out other than just 1 less operating day. Going forward, I would say that we would anticipate our surgical volume to reflect our longer term trends, which has historically been somewhere around that 2 point growth. And again, there is some variables that fluctuate on that, but that was the issue on the flat surgical volume for Q4, was nothing other than 1 less surgical day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I appreciate you guys breaking out kind of how you thought about the core pricing in the quarter. Is there a way to do that in the 2023 guidance? Obviously, the COVID is a headwind 340B is a headwind, and then how to think about anything else that\u2019s a moving piece there? I just want to understand the core trends in pricing, and then maybe talk a little bit about commercial rate growth of what you\u2019re renegotiating today? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Kevin, let me start with that. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we are anticipating revenue per equivalent admission around 2%. That\u2019s on an as-reported basis. Obviously, I called out some of those non-recurring revenue items we\u2019ve had the benefit of in \u201822, we don\u2019t expect to continue next year. If you adjust for those, that\u2019d probably be pushing us towards closer to 3% number, which would be, historically, we would see 2% to 3% growth. So what really moves us back into our historical pricing trends, what we would see pre-COVID is just that we are having to jump over some of that loss of cohort. So that was a 2% guidance on a revenue per equivalent admission. If you adjust that, it\u2019d be closer to 3%, which is in line with our long-term guidance. That\u2019s contemplating both our Medicare rate updates with some improved commercial pricing that I think we\u2019ve talked about in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, good morning. I know some of your peers have noted that physician outsourcing services especially on the ER is a pressure point for 2023. Are you seeing that? And if so, how much of a headwind is it to EBITDA? And secondly, just on the merchant turnover, I know you said that while you had a big improvement, you\u2019re still not where you want to be. Can you talk about where you were for nursing turnover pre pandemic, where you ended Q4, and maybe where you think you could end 2023? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Excuse me. So Ann, it\u2019s Sam. We, pre pandemic, were somewhere around 13% or 14% \u2013 excuse me, 14% for nursing turnover. We\u2019re on a run rate now 18%, 18.5%. That\u2019s down from mid-20s. We think the industry average is somewhere in the mid to upper 20s right now from what we\u2019ve seen external benchmarks and so forth. So we\u2019re really encouraged by the progress our teams have made. And again, over the last 6 months of the year, we were starting to see improving trends. We believe we have the right initiatives in place to carry some momentum in that area into 2023. The market, as I mentioned, is a bit tenuous still, but we\u2019re encouraged by the investments we\u2019ve made in our recruiting, the investments we\u2019ve made in retention and leadership training and just the \u2013 I\u2019ll call it, the hand-to-hand combat that exists in making sure that our employees have the resources on their units that are necessary for them to deliver great care to their patients and for them to be successful in whatever their role is in the company. And we think we\u2019re making progress on pretty much all of those fronts.\nBill Rutherford: And Ann, on the emergency room, I\u2019ve brought it to more than emergency from just hospital-based physician we have talked about in the past. We are seeing some increased pressures for subsidies around our interest room and anesthesiologists and the like. We have a number of initiatives to try to counter those. But yes, we are expecting some upward pressure in those areas that we factored into our guidance. If it rolls through, as I mentioned in the previous question, in our other operating expenses, then we could potentially see higher single-digit year-over-year growth in those categories, probably at a little bit of pace above our revenue. But we think we\u2019ve made appropriate consideration for those trends inside of our guidance.\nAnn Hynes: Alright. Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. I guess, Sam, follow-up to Ann\u2019s question and to Bill\u2019s answer of that. I saw that you exercise the call option and the Envision JV last week. So just curious how you\u2019re thinking about operationalizing that and what would change for HCA as you bring those physicians back in-house? And maybe just thoughts on the P&L and balance sheet impact of that as well? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: So we\u2019ve had a wonderful relationship with Envision over the years, and it continues to be strong across different facilities in our company. A number of years ago, we had made an investment in a co-venture with them that we felt was an opportunity for us to integrate that physician service, mainly in the ER and hospitalist medicine and a few other subspecialty categories within our hospitals as more clinically aligned and so forth. And what we see is an opportunity to further that. And so we are moving to acquire a larger percentage of that co-venture, and we think it will give us a little better visibility in how to achieve better clinical integration to improve quality. We think we can use that platform to improve efficiency within our emergency rooms primarily and even on our med surge floors where our hospitalists work. It will support graduate medical education in some innovative ways, we believe. And then, finally, we think it offers up an opportunity for us to advance our connections to our strategic outreach partners in ways that maybe we don\u2019t necessarily accomplish in the structure we have today. So we are pushing through the final stages of that transaction. I think it\u2019s scheduled to close sometime in the spring. We will take the rest of the year to fully assimilate it, so to speak. And then as we get into 2024, we anticipate being able to execute more effectively on these categories.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on the 2023 guidance, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more specifically about your expectations on inpatient admissions. I guess, first, how are you thinking about where the COVID figure goes in 2023 compared to the 5.2% of admissions in 2022? Any implication being I\u2019d love to hear how you\u2019re thinking about non-COVID admission growth in 2023? Thank you.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. So I\u2019ll start with that. So we expect a continued decline of COVID admission as you\u2019ve mentioned, and I said in my prepared remarks, they represent about 5.2% of our total admissions. This year, we\u2019re thinking next year, probably somewhere between 3% and 4% of our total admissions. We believe right now, our inpatient admission growth somewhere around that 2% number, and that\u2019s embedded within the equivalent admission guidance that I gave between 2% to 3%. And again, we will continue to monitor that as we go through the year. We continue to believe that there is strong demand in our markets, and we\u2019re positioned well to serve that demand. So inpatient volume, we\u2019re thinking hovering around 2%, and then outpatient revenue probably continue to grow in that mid-single-digit level. And that helps us get to the 2% to 3% equivalent admissions that\u2019s \u2013 that our guidance entails.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Interested if you can just recap for us what the non-COVID acuity and case mix trends were in 2022. And then what you\u2019re building in for your assumptions for 2023? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. So I don\u2019t know if I have the case mix necessarily. We\u2019ve seen relatively flat, as I recall, on the COVID case mix, right? Our non-COVID mix improved about 2% sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter going forward. Our revenue per equivalent admission was roughly flat for the year-over-year comparisons.\nScott Fidel: And then, Bill, on the outlook for \u201823.\nBill Rutherford: For non-COVID?\nScott Fidel: Yes.\nBill Rutherford: Yes, that would be embedded in our revenue per equivalent admission of about 2%. And then when you factor out the loss of the revenue items, I think, as I mentioned earlier, that pushes us closer to 3%. And that would be just a combination of all factors of acuity as well as payer mix and pricing trends underneath the...\nSam Hazen: And Bill if I can add, I think it\u2019s important for everybody to understand it. Strategically, we continue to invest in programs, as I mentioned in my prepared comments. A lot of those programs are farther up the acuity ladder, if you will. They are more significant programs. They are extensions of existing programs and as we get our footing, so to speak, with a mid-level program or an upper-mid level program, then we can move into a more acute level program. And that helps with our overall acuity statistic. So, that part of our strategy, we are doing that on top of the same fixed cost platform. So, our hospitals have the same fixed cost regardless of the acuity in many instances. And so if we can increase the acuity, we get operating leverage from that. So, strategically, that\u2019s a very important initiative of ours. The transfers and that we haven\u2019t been able to take care of tends to be slightly more acute than our average in most instances. And here, again, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to get more employees across the organization to take care of these patients who need our services. But all of that\u2019s embedded inside of a real strategic initiative that we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan.\nCalvin Sternick: Hi. Good morning. It looks like another strong quarter for ER volumes. Can you talk a bit about the trends you have seen there in the last few quarters in terms of payer acuity mix, and what you are expecting for sort of full year? And as you think about the volume trends across the business over the last couple of quarters, are there any service lines or categories that have over or underperformed relative to your expectations? And any color you can give on those going into 2023? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. Let me speak to some of our service lines trends. During the pandemic, we felt the emergency room might be disrupted from what our previous beliefs were. And there was new uses of telemedicine alternatives that were being experienced, we thought. What we have seen is just the opposite. The resiliency of the emergency room for communities is even greater than we thought. And the demand there is very strong because our emergency rooms and other people\u2019s emergency rooms are a solution set for people whenever healthcare is needed. So, our trends in the emergency room have been very solid over the course of the year. And when you look at them really without the COVID activity, it\u2019s especially impressive I think. We have seen good volume growth in our orthopedics. Our total joint business for the quarter was up 6%. In many instances, we fully absorbed, we believe, most of the shift over the last 3 years during the pandemic, with the orthopedic business moving from inpatient to outpatient. And in most instances, we believe the large majority of that is behind us. And so we don\u2019t have that as a pressure point like we have had over the past 3 years. But nonetheless, we have grown that business in the face of the site of care shift. We have a very robust pipeline for our emergency rooms, especially our freestanding emergency room platform, a very significant development opportunity there for us across our communities, and we are investing in that. Our urgent care center platform continues to grow. We are up to 260 urgent care centers. We will probably push through 300 in 2023. Our ambulatory surgery center platform continues to grow. Here, again, we have more de novo development inside of our ambulatory surgery center platform than we have had in the past, and we are encouraged by how that fits into our networks in a very productive way. So, we are really pretty excited about our investments in our ambulatory network, our investments in our acuity programs and our higher service lines. And we will continue to \u2013 we believe, be well positioned to deal with the growing demand that we see in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Could you just talk a little bit about permanent nurses and understand the retention rates are getting better there. Can you talk a little bit about new hirings, what sort of growth you are seeing there? What are maybe some of the drivers of access to nurses there, where are they coming from? And then also, if you could just talk a little bit about, you said the investment spend was pressuring and the long-term plan was pressuring \u201822 a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about how \u201823 might look compared to \u201822 with that? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Why don\u2019t you take, Bill, the last question?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. On the investments, when you think about the technology investments, the investments we are making in some of the clinical transformation. And I would also say, with the expansion of our nursing schools going forward, probably is somewhere around an incremental investment of $150 million in \u201823 compared to what we ran in \u201822. Lance, we didn\u2019t call that out, but it\u2019s part of a long-term investment we think, that will continue to drive performance and value for us.\nSam Hazen: So, our hiring in 2022 was up a little north of 6%, just a huge number of new hires. And so that\u2019s the total number just as a starting point. Where that is coming from, that\u2019s coming from new grads. There still is a decent pipeline of new graduate nurses in our communities. We have academic partnerships with different colleges beyond Galen that are important to that pipeline. We are also seeing some travelers decide that, okay, enough, we traveled, we want to come back, and we have been able to recover some of the employees who traveled for a period of time back into our organization. So, we continue to be focused on trying to recover them. And I think again, with our benefits and with our wage adjustments and all the investments we are making in clinical education and other components of our labor agenda, we are starting to see more favorable trends in our recruitment function that we think, if they carry into 2023 and through the year, should be positive for us.\nLance Wilkes: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citigroup.\nJason Cassorla: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a bit more on your capital priorities. You have recently divested ownership in some hospitals. But just wondering how you are viewing the M&A backdrop and if you are seeing opportunities to increase your footprint in your current markets or potentially entering into new markets? And then just on share repurchases, you have increased your authorization by $3 billion, you have $4.5 billion rough remaining. It\u2019s just in light of the $7 billion this year. Just curious how you are thinking about share repurchases in the context of your larger capital deployment priorities? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes, let me take that. This is Bill. Let me take the latter one first. I think share repurchases, you spend an important part of our overall balanced capital allocation. As you mentioned, we did $7 billion in \u201822. We will have authorization close to $4.5 billion. I think we would plan on completing the majority of it sometime in this calendar year with a little bit of roll forward afterwards. And again, we will continue to adjust as kind of market conditions present, but a share repurchase program has just been part of our overall balanced allocation of capital going forward.\nSam Hazen: For M&A, we have been fairly active in the market with outpatient acquisitions again when they come available, whether it\u2019s urgent care, some freestanding emergency room, some ASC, some physician clinics and so forth. And those are very complementary, synergistic to our network acquisitions, and we will continue to pursue those as they develop. We have not had too many opportunities on hospital acquisitions. Although, recently there was an announced LOI on a hospital just outside of the Dallas-Fort Worth market that we think is synergistic with respect to clinical services and so forth with our system in Dallas-Fort Worth. So, we will continue to look for those. We do have a pipeline of Greenfield hospitals because the acquisition environment is not as robust end market as maybe we would have hoped. So, we need to consider Greenfield projects, and we do have a number of those that are in the works. We have one under construction currently in San Antonio. And I want to say we have seven or eight parcels of land, maybe 10, that are designed for future hospital development when the time is right for us to make those investments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning everybody. So, just on the surgical volumes, you addressed most of the key questions related to the volumes for both the fourth quarter and the full year \u201823. But just a follow-up on that topic to get, I guess a little bit more. I was just curious whether or not you do see any notable pent-up demand for any surgical cases exiting out of 4Q \u201822 that might be falling at least into the early part of \u201823 for various reasons, just curious any visibility on early \u201823 at this stage? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: It\u2019s hard for us to really judge the \u2013 whether there is demand on the sidelines, and we don\u2019t see it. I mean we get some anecdotal information from our physicians who might indicate that, okay, their clinic patient profiles were better in the fourth quarter than they were at any point in time in 2022. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a precursor or not for pent-up elective surgical demand. I think we are just going to have to wait and see. But I believe it\u2019s a positive metric and a positive anecdote that their clinic roles, patient roles appear to be at a higher level than they were in previous parts of 2022.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.\nJamie Perse: Thank you. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the commercial reimbursement dynamics, first, can you remind us what percent of contracts have been recently negotiated that will take us back at the higher rate January 1st? And then secondly, can you give us a little bit of color on what the initial bump in those contracts looks like relative to the rate escalators that are locked in place for the next couple of years? Thank you.\nSam Hazen: We have, I want to say, Bill, maybe 70% of our contracts for 2024 contracted. I will tell you that most of the contracts, if not all of the contracts we closed in the last three quarters of \u201822 were in line with our expectations, which was around mid-single digit inflators. So, those have to work their way into the \u201823 portfolio of contracts and on into the 2024. So, we are encouraged by the outcomes of those negotiations. I think there is a general recognition in the payer community that the input costs for providers is up, or up. And so given those inflationary pressures, they recognize that there is a sensitivity to respond to that. And we are trying to be appropriate in our app. And I think that\u2019s been received well, and we have been able to close these contracts reasonably timely. So, we still have 30% or so of 2023 that will get negotiated over the first part of this year, and will carry us through all of \u201823 and into \u201824. We are about 40% contracted on \u201824. Again, the tail effect of some of the closed contract negotiations that we have just achieved will carry into 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I know CapEx guidance for 2023 is only down slightly, and I know it\u2019s still January, but it would be the first time in a long, long time, the CapEx would be down year-over-year, not counting 2020. I was wondering if you could just speak to any changes in budgeting or strategy or if there is anything that could be tempering that investment?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Josh, I don\u2019t think there is anything tempering in the investment at all. I think 4.3% is our expectation. As I mentioned in my comments, we initially expected 4.2%. For \u201822, it came in a little higher because we had some year-end activity that I mentioned around some real estate and some IT. So, I wouldn\u2019t read anything from down to the fourth quarter 4.3%. It\u2019s actually up compared to where our initial expectations are. But as a summary, we still see very good opportunities to deploy capital, we believe, to capture growth opportunities in the marketplace. And we have talked about some of that, whether that would be through our freestanding EDs, whether there is some development of new hospitals, whether it would be expansion of campuses. So, again, I think it\u2019s an important part of our overall capital allocation and I think an important part of our continued long-term focus on growing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Mok with UBS.\nAndrew Mok: Hi. Good morning. I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on the supply cost trends into 2023. What are the assumptions around unit cost increases versus \u2013 what steps did you take to manage inflationary pressure for multiyear contracts? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Well, thank you for the question. Our teams and our supply chain teams have done an incredible job over the past 12 months to 18 months on our supply cost portfolio, and especially with the backdrop of inflationary increases. And we have talked about through the year, we have been really seeing really positive trends in and actually to keep our supply cost growth below our revenue growth. Much of that was because some of our contracts, 60% of our contracts or so was under firm pricing for the most of \u201822. As we look forward, I think our basic assumption is to continue to keep our supply cost as a percent of revenue flat from where we ran full year \u201823. That would imply our supply cost per unit is somewhere around that 2% level, plus or minus a little bit. But again, we are expecting continued good results in that. And again, our team is doing a nice job. We can keep that supply cost as a percent of revenue flat with where we ran this year, with the backdrop of inflationary that\u2019s pretty positive. We have a number of initiatives underway that our teams use. Part of our benchmarking initiatives is to look at utilization and identify best practices across the organization. We also are looking at product selection, partnering with our clinical teams. So, we have a number of initiatives underneath our supply chain operations that are helping us to achieve those results, and we look forward to those continuing as we go into \u201823.\nOperator: Our final question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.\nJohn Ransom: Yes. Hard it is to be clever with the question after all these good questions. I believe three in my question here and have five minutes. So, for me, if we think about, as you reduce your labor turnover, so let\u2019s say it goes hypothetically from 25 to 20, how does that \u2013 how would that affect your labor cost per \u2013 either for revenue or per unit? How does that factor into the savings algorithm for us to think about?\nBill Rutherford: How it affects our revenue per unit?\nJohn Ransom: Well. No. I mean salary either salary as a percent of adjusted admits or salary as a percent of revenue, how does reducing turnover? If you reduce turnover about say, 500 bps, how would that affect the labor margin?\nBill Rutherford: Well, in theory, will flow through as reduction of our contract labor. And so the margin, if you will, on the contract labor as we replace an individual from a contractor to an employed one is that we will save that margin. And being able to reinvest and what we have been able to do this year is reinvest back into our employee workforce and that\u2019s part of that turnover level. And I think all of that, John, I would say, is incorporated, if you look at the overall labor spend. So, I mean there is a lot of components into that. And as we said, we think we can maintain our labor cost as a percent of revenue where we are finished this year. It\u2019s a function of reducing those premium labor and reinvesting back into our employee workforce and keeping that relatively flat year-over-year. And I think that\u2019s a good result for us and allows us to continue to recognize the important work our employees do for us.\nJohn Ransom: Thanks a lot.\nBill Rutherford: Thanks John.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Frank Morgan.\nFrank Morgan: Devin, thank you for your help today and thanks to everyone for joining us on this call. We hope you have a great weekend. I am around this afternoon, if I can answer additional questions you might have. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Sam and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter and the year then discuss our \u201823 guidance. We finished the year with good volume metrics. Our fourth quarter same facility admissions increased 2.9% over the prior year. For the full year, our same-facility admissions were up 0.5%. Excluding COVID admissions, our same-facility admissions grew 5.4% in the quarter and were up 3.4% for the year. For the full year, COVID admissions accounted for 5.2% of our admissions versus 7.8% in the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 11.4% in the quarter as compared to the prior year and were up 7.6% for the full year. Our same-facility outpatient surgeries were up slightly in the quarter from the prior year, but increased 5.6% sequentially compared to the third quarter. Same-facility inpatient surgeries were basically flat as compared to the prior year. Both were impacted by 1 less business day in the quarter. Our same-facility revenue per equivalent admission was down 2.6% in the quarter from the prior year as this was influenced by the drop in COVID activity. Sequentially, our non-COVID revenue per equivalent admission increased approximately 3.7% as compared to the third quarter. Our case mix increased just under 2% sequentially from the third quarter and our payer mix remained stable as well. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating costs even with the backdrop of higher inflation rates. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins were 20.5% in the quarter and right at 20% for the full year. We continue to focus on our labor plans and supporting our teams, while appropriately managing contract labor and premium pay programs. Our total labor cost as a percentage of revenue improved both sequentially and when compared to the prior year. In addition, our supply cost trends have remained very consistent during the year and we are pleased with these results. Other operating expenses have been subject to some inflationary cost pressures when compared to the prior year, but has run fairly consistent as a percent of revenue throughout 2022. Our cash flow and capital allocation are a key part of our long-term growth and value-creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion in 2022. Our capital spending was just under $4.4 billion for the year, which was slightly higher than our initial expectations due to some year end real estate and information technology purchases. We paid dividends of about $650 million and we repurchased $7 billion of our outstanding stock during the year. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3x to 4x. For full year 2022, we realized approximately $1.2 billion in proceeds from sales of facilities and healthcare entities. So, let me speak to our 2023 guidance for a moment. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year \u201823 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $61.5 billion and $63.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.525 billion and $4.895 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $16.40 and $17.60. And we expect capital spending to approximate $4.3 billion during the year. So, let me provide some additional commentary on our guidance. Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance is impacted by several governmental and policy changes. In 2022, we recognized approximately $280 million in COVID support mainly from DRG add-ons, removal of sequestration cuts and HRSA reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients. We expect very little revenue from these programs in 2023. Also, as discussed in our first quarter release, we recognized $244 million of revenues and $90 million of expenses related to the Texas directed payment program that was for the last 4 months of 2021. This program that started on September 1, \u201821 was not improved until the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we estimate the impact of the 340B related payment reductions to be between $50 million and $100 million. Adjusted for these items, the midpoint of our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance would be in the middle of our historical 4% to 6% growth expectations that we have had over time. Within our guidance, we expect our same facility equivalent admissions to grow approximately 2% to 3% and our revenue per equivalent admission to grow approximately 2%. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3.1 billion and interest expense is projected to be around $1.975 billion. Interest expense will be impacted by both higher rates and anticipated draws under our revolving credit facilities. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be about $278 million for the full year and cash flow from operations is estimated to range between $8.5 billion and $9 billion. Also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program. This will be in addition to the approximate $1.5 billion remaining authorization we had under the previous program at the end of the year. In addition, our Board has declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.56 to $0.60 per share. With that, I will turn the call over to Frank and we will open it up for Q&A. Yes. Justin, this is Bill. Let me start. So as it relates to labor cost, I think as a percentage of revenue, we will keep it on an as-reported basis, flat with where we ran for the full year of this year. We continue to expect improvement in the utilization and cost of contract labor as we go through the balance of the year. And so I think that's a good output for us. Relative to payer mix, we think payer mix for now will mostly remain stable. We are encouraged with what we are seeing with the enrollment in the health insurance exchanges and we believe the enrollment in our states, are probably a little bit higher than what we see as a nation. And so we think we have contemplated that within the context of our overall range, but we are encouraged with some of the payer mix trends. Yes, Gary. On contract labor for the quarter, we were down about 16% from where we ran in the fourth quarter of last year. So good improvement in that area. It represented roughly 7.8% of our total salary wages and benefits. We talked about given that number before. So again, solid trends in the fourth of this year compared to where we ran last year and especially where we ran in the first half of the year. Our other operating expenses, you're right, are subject to some of the general inflationary increases that we're seeing across the economy. When we think about utilities and insurance and, in addition, our professional fees areas, we're seeing some higher single-digit cost growth in other operating expenses. Fortunately, if you look across the quarters for 2022, as a percentage of revenue, you'll see our other operating expenses as a percent of revenue staying relatively and pretty consistent throughout the year. As we look forward to 2023, we do believe that's an area that can continue to see some higher single-digit inflationary pressures, and we factored that in to our guidance going forward. Again, we think labor supplies will keep in line and hopefully below where our revenue growth is. But the other operating cost area is around utilities, insurance pro fees are going to continue to see some pressures, and we factor that into our guidance. So Peter, this is Bill. I think our surgical volume, the most \u2013 the thing being pushed out was we had 1 less business day, 1 less surgical day, and so that could account for 1.5 points or 2 of that trend. And I don't think there is any other trends that we observed in our out-patient or in-patient surgery or call out other than just 1 less operating day. Going forward, I would say that we would anticipate our surgical volume to reflect our longer term trends, which has historically been somewhere around that 2 point growth. And again, there is some variables that fluctuate on that, but that was the issue on the flat surgical volume for Q4, was nothing other than 1 less surgical day. Yes, Kevin, let me start with that. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we are anticipating revenue per equivalent admission around 2%. That's on an as-reported basis. Obviously, I called out some of those non-recurring revenue items we've had the benefit of in \u201822, we don't expect to continue next year. If you adjust for those, that'd probably be pushing us towards closer to 3% number, which would be, historically, we would see 2% to 3% growth. So what really moves us back into our historical pricing trends, what we would see pre-COVID is just that we are having to jump over some of that loss of cohort. So that was a 2% guidance on a revenue per equivalent admission. If you adjust that, it'd be closer to 3%, which is in line with our long-term guidance. That's contemplating both our Medicare rate updates with some improved commercial pricing that I think we've talked about in the past. And Ann, on the emergency room, I've brought it to more than emergency from just hospital-based physician we have talked about in the past. We are seeing some increased pressures for subsidies around our interest room and anesthesiologists and the like. We have a number of initiatives to try to counter those. But yes, we are expecting some upward pressure in those areas that we factored into our guidance. If it rolls through, as I mentioned in the previous question, in our other operating expenses, then we could potentially see higher single-digit year-over-year growth in those categories, probably at a little bit of pace above our revenue. But we think we've made appropriate consideration for those trends inside of our guidance. Yes. Yes. So I'll start with that. So we expect a continued decline of COVID admission as you've mentioned, and I said in my prepared remarks, they represent about 5.2% of our total admissions. This year, we're thinking next year, probably somewhere between 3% and 4% of our total admissions. We believe right now, our inpatient admission growth somewhere around that 2% number, and that's embedded within the equivalent admission guidance that I gave between 2% to 3%. And again, we will continue to monitor that as we go through the year. We continue to believe that there is strong demand in our markets, and we're positioned well to serve that demand. So inpatient volume, we're thinking hovering around 2%, and then outpatient revenue probably continue to grow in that mid-single-digit level. And that helps us get to the 2% to 3% equivalent admissions that's \u2013 that our guidance entails. Yes. So I don't know if I have the case mix necessarily. We've seen relatively flat, as I recall, on the COVID case mix, right? Our non-COVID mix improved about 2% sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter going forward. Our revenue per equivalent admission was roughly flat for the year-over-year comparisons. For non-COVID? Yes, that would be embedded in our revenue per equivalent admission of about 2%. And then when you factor out the loss of the revenue items, I think, as I mentioned earlier, that pushes us closer to 3%. And that would be just a combination of all factors of acuity as well as payer mix and pricing trends underneath the... Yes. This is Bill. On the investments, when you think about the technology investments, the investments we are making in some of the clinical transformation. And I would also say, with the expansion of our nursing schools going forward, probably is somewhere around an incremental investment of $150 million in \u201823 compared to what we ran in \u201822. Lance, we didn't call that out, but it's part of a long-term investment we think, that will continue to drive performance and value for us. Yes, let me take that. This is Bill. Let me take the latter one first. I think share repurchases, you spend an important part of our overall balanced capital allocation. As you mentioned, we did $7 billion in \u201822. We will have authorization close to $4.5 billion. I think we would plan on completing the majority of it sometime in this calendar year with a little bit of roll forward afterwards. And again, we will continue to adjust as kind of market conditions present, but a share repurchase program has just been part of our overall balanced allocation of capital going forward. Yes. Josh, I don't think there is anything tempering in the investment at all. I think 4.3% is our expectation. As I mentioned in my comments, we initially expected 4.2%. For \u201822, it came in a little higher because we had some year-end activity that I mentioned around some real estate and some IT. So, I wouldn't read anything from down to the fourth quarter 4.3%. It's actually up compared to where our initial expectations are. But as a summary, we still see very good opportunities to deploy capital, we believe, to capture growth opportunities in the marketplace. And we have talked about some of that, whether that would be through our freestanding EDs, whether there is some development of new hospitals, whether it would be expansion of campuses. So, again, I think it's an important part of our overall capital allocation and I think an important part of our continued long-term focus on growing. How it affects our revenue per unit? Well, in theory, will flow through as reduction of our contract labor. And so the margin, if you will, on the contract labor as we replace an individual from a contractor to an employed one is that we will save that margin. And being able to reinvest and what we have been able to do this year is reinvest back into our employee workforce and that's part of that turnover level. And I think all of that, John, I would say, is incorporated, if you look at the overall labor spend. So, I mean there is a lot of components into that. And as we said, we think we can maintain our labor cost as a percent of revenue where we are finished this year. It's a function of reducing those premium labor and reinvesting back into our employee workforce and keeping that relatively flat year-over-year. And I think that's a good result for us and allows us to continue to recognize the important work our employees do for us. Thanks John."

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "Alright. Good morning and thank you for joining the call. We finished 2022 as expected with pre-pandemic seasonality demand norms driving solid volume growth. Additionally, we continue to see progress with our labor agenda. These factors helped produce solid earnings in the fourth quarter that were consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged by this outcome and believe this operational momentum should position us well for 2023. 2022 was a tale of two halves, with the first half being more about winding down from the previous 2 years of intense COVID activity and responding to the resulting challenges. The second half was more about normalization, which included strong demand and an improving labor market. Once again, I believe our people have demonstrated an impressive capability in the face of these dynamic forces and delivered for our patients, the communities we serve and other stakeholders. Healthcare people in general are unique, but I believe HCA Healthcare people are even more special. I'll often refer to them as can-do people, and again, this past year, I think they proved it. I want to thank them for their hard work and everything they do each and everyday for our company. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong in the fourth quarter. Admissions grew 3% year-over-year. Non-COVID admissions increased in excess of 5%. Equivalent admissions were up 5.4%, with impressive growth of 11% in the emergency room. Most of our other volume categories had solid growth metrics in the quarter also. The payer mix and acuity levels in the quarter remained at favorable levels. These factors produced revenue growth against a difficult comparison of 3% in the quarter. With respect to our people agenda, we were pleased with the improvements we saw in key metrics. Turnover numbers for registered nurses were down 26% in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous four quarters' average. Our turnover rate is still higher than we want, but we believe it is better than the industry average. Employee engagement scores recovered to around pre-pandemic levels. Again, our engagement is above the industry average. Our recruiting teams continue to generate results for the company. Hiring increased 6% year-over-year in 2022. And lastly, we opened our seventh Galan College of Nursing School this year. With respect to labor costs during the quarter, we experienced stable labor cost per hour with utilization of contract labor declining. As we have detailed in the past, we have implemented a robust human resources plan. We executed well on it and expect to make further progress as we move into 2023. It remains a top organizational priority. Even with the progress, we continued this quarter to experience capacity constraints, creating situations where we were unable to deliver services in certain situations. Also in the quarter, we saw value from our portfolio optimization plan and closed two joint ventures with strategic partners; one was with our Sarah Cannon Research Institute, which we combined with McKesson's cancer research entity. We believe the combination of these two entities will produce better cancer research and more clinical trials across the country, providing even more community-based resources for physicians and patients to fight this disease. The second co-venture is with our CoreTrust purchasing organization. We closed on a new partnership with Blackstone. We believe this new relationship can expand our ability to offer commercial purchasing and services solutions to a broader variety of customers. We believe both of these deals achieved our strategic objectives and connected us with better platforms for success in the future. We are excited to partner with both entities. We also implemented our capital plan for the year as expected, including redeploying the proceeds from these two new joint ventures. Bill will provide more details in his comments. And finally, we announced in the last quarter a significant leadership transition that we believe will position the organization better with responding timelier to market dynamics, while also strengthening the alignment of corporate functions to our strategy. The executives who are part of this transition are all proven HCA executives, they understand and appreciate our culture and they know how to execute. As we push ahead into 2023 and beyond, we believe the strong demand for healthcare services presents opportunity for HCA Healthcare in an otherwise challenging macro environment. We believe the company is well-positioned culturally, competitively and financially to capitalize. Our agenda next year will be focused on the following three areas. First, overcoming labor and capacity challenges. Again, we believe we have the appropriate initiatives in place to respond to these. Second, counter inflationary pressures. Again, we have numerous efforts in place to contend with these forces, while ensuring we continue to deliver high-quality outcomes to our patients. And third, accelerating growth with our winning plays. This agenda continues to leverage capital investments in outpatient facilities, clinical equipment for our physicians and service line expansion. On top of our 2023 agenda, we are also making investments in our long-term plan, which includes four primary elements: the first one is advancing our clinical systems and digital capabilities; second is transforming care models with innovative solutions; third is expanding our workforce development programs; and fourth, is investing capital in our networks to expand their offerings. These efforts are pressuring our results some in the current year, but we believe they are necessary in creating a platform for ultimately optimizing our networks so they can deliver even better patient care in the future. Let me close with this. The last 3 years have been an extraordinary experience for everyone at HCA Healthcare. There has been no rest nor retreat for our people and it was truly a challenge like no other. I strongly believe however that our Board, our management teams and our caregivers have shined through it all. We went into the pandemic with two priorities, to protect our people and to protect the organization so we could continue providing high-quality healthcare to the communities we serve. I believe strongly that we showed up, we delivered on these priorities and we did it the right way. I am proud of HCA Healthcare and I am even more proud of our people. The future for our company is even brighter because of the past 3 years and what we learned. Now we will move into 2023 and the years ahead with greater purpose, with a renewed agenda to drive growth and with more confidence in our ability to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn the call to Bill and he will discuss the quarter's results in more detail and our 2023 guidance. A.J., this is Sam. I think on the guidance, I mean, we have got 2.5%, I believe, on either side of the midpoint. The top side of that range I think is achievable if our volume and labor agenda happens maybe a little bit better than what we anticipate. The low side of that range would be greater inflationary pressures and maybe some more challenges in a tenuous labor market. Those are sort of the big variables, if you will, in the equation. I mean, it's a fairly big number to begin with and again, the 2.5% range on either side of the midpoint we think is not unreasonable. So to consider it to be very wide seems maybe to not fully appreciate some of the variables inside of it. With respect to labor, yes, we have made significant investments in our people. We did that throughout last year mainly in the late summer, early fall, where we adjusted our wages to deal with movement in the market resulting from some visibility that we had with our overall competitive positioning. Some of the contract labor reductions that we expect and have already made even will be absorbed a little bit in those decisions, but we think the net of it is what Bill just alluded to, and that is that we can maintain our labor cost as a percent of revenue roughly around what we finished 2022 at. So that's how we're thinking about it. And again, we're seeing positive metrics across the key dimensions of our labor agenda that is encouraging to us. And we believe we have more room to gain with our agenda, and we're hopeful that, that will continue throughout 2023. This is Sam. Thank you for that. I mean we did, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, had some moments in the quarter where we were unable to receive transfers in or take certain patients into our facilities. And that was actually a little bit elevated over the third quarter. We had roughly, using this as the proxy, approximately 2% of our total admissions we were unable to take through our transfer centers and ahead to find those patients alternative solutions where we could. We were busier in the fourth quarter than we were in the third quarter, so that was part of it. But nonetheless, we still are seeing opportunities for us to improve the throughput through our case management initiatives, as you spoke to, continue to increase the head count in our facilities in order to take care of these patients. And we're hopeful that those numbers will start to come down a little bit as we push into 2023. Well, let me give you a little bit of a backdrop on our long-term thinking with in \u2013 and I think this going to help you understand why we are investing in these categories. First and foremost, we think we have just an incredible portfolio of communities that we serve. They are growing in and of themselves. So we have opportunities to invest in that growth. We think demand is going to grow in our markets. Aging baby boomers population growth chronic conditions, all those things unfortunately produce demand in some respect. And we think our portfolio is a little better than the national averages on that front. So we've got that as a backdrop. So there is opportunities, I'll call it, outside the walls of HCA to invest in that natural growth in demand. The second piece that we believe exists is opportunities inside of HCA. We have what we call an economy of opportunities that exist across our 180 hospitals and 2,400 outpatient facilities that we have. And that opportunity is to use big data, use better clinical system capability and better analytics to support better care. And so our technology agenda, coupled with our care transformation agenda, is really about tapping into the economy of opportunity that exist inside our organization. So we think we have two sets of opportunities, outside to continue to grow market share and benefit from the growth in our markets, and then continued improvement in care delivery for better patient outcomes, more efficiency, better operational management in our hospitals by infusing machine learning, advanced analytics with our care transformation agenda. So our care transformation team is led by a physician and a clinical team with industrial engineers and other type of people who are big data analysts who are supporting evaluating great performance that we have inside our company and really studying the processes around those, or looking outside the company for better processes, better technologies, and, again, weaving that into our overall agenda for our long run. And we're encouraged by that. We have a major initiative that we're rolling out this year in our obstetrics unit, and we're excited about the possibilities around that. On our clinical systems, we are actually in our alpha pilot on our clinical system upgrades. We will have a beta pilot later this year. This is a system that we will be able to push more information, standardized information into the cloud and start to turn that into actionable insights that, we believe, can help our patient outcomes. So we're really excited about our long-run agenda. And again, it's geared toward better patient care, but capitalizing on the opportunities inside the walls of HCA. Excuse me. So Ann, it's Sam. We, pre pandemic, were somewhere around 13% or 14% \u2013 excuse me, 14% for nursing turnover. We're on a run rate now 18%, 18.5%. That's down from mid-20s. We think the industry average is somewhere in the mid to upper 20s right now from what we've seen external benchmarks and so forth. So we're really encouraged by the progress our teams have made. And again, over the last 6 months of the year, we were starting to see improving trends. We believe we have the right initiatives in place to carry some momentum in that area into 2023. The market, as I mentioned, is a bit tenuous still, but we're encouraged by the investments we've made in our recruiting, the investments we've made in retention and leadership training and just the \u2013 I'll call it, the hand-to-hand combat that exists in making sure that our employees have the resources on their units that are necessary for them to deliver great care to their patients and for them to be successful in whatever their role is in the company. And we think we're making progress on pretty much all of those fronts. So we've had a wonderful relationship with Envision over the years, and it continues to be strong across different facilities in our company. A number of years ago, we had made an investment in a co-venture with them that we felt was an opportunity for us to integrate that physician service, mainly in the ER and hospitalist medicine and a few other subspecialty categories within our hospitals as more clinically aligned and so forth. And what we see is an opportunity to further that. And so we are moving to acquire a larger percentage of that co-venture, and we think it will give us a little better visibility in how to achieve better clinical integration to improve quality. We think we can use that platform to improve efficiency within our emergency rooms primarily and even on our med surge floors where our hospitalists work. It will support graduate medical education in some innovative ways, we believe. And then, finally, we think it offers up an opportunity for us to advance our connections to our strategic outreach partners in ways that maybe we don't necessarily accomplish in the structure we have today. So we are pushing through the final stages of that transaction. I think it's scheduled to close sometime in the spring. We will take the rest of the year to fully assimilate it, so to speak. And then as we get into 2024, we anticipate being able to execute more effectively on these categories. And Bill if I can add, I think it's important for everybody to understand it. Strategically, we continue to invest in programs, as I mentioned in my prepared comments. A lot of those programs are farther up the acuity ladder, if you will. They are more significant programs. They are extensions of existing programs and as we get our footing, so to speak, with a mid-level program or an upper-mid level program, then we can move into a more acute level program. And that helps with our overall acuity statistic. So, that part of our strategy, we are doing that on top of the same fixed cost platform. So, our hospitals have the same fixed cost regardless of the acuity in many instances. And so if we can increase the acuity, we get operating leverage from that. So, strategically, that's a very important initiative of ours. The transfers and that we haven't been able to take care of tends to be slightly more acute than our average in most instances. And here, again, that's why it's so important for us to get more employees across the organization to take care of these patients who need our services. But all of that's embedded inside of a real strategic initiative that we have. This is Sam. Let me speak to some of our service lines trends. During the pandemic, we felt the emergency room might be disrupted from what our previous beliefs were. And there was new uses of telemedicine alternatives that were being experienced, we thought. What we have seen is just the opposite. The resiliency of the emergency room for communities is even greater than we thought. And the demand there is very strong because our emergency rooms and other people's emergency rooms are a solution set for people whenever healthcare is needed. So, our trends in the emergency room have been very solid over the course of the year. And when you look at them really without the COVID activity, it's especially impressive I think. We have seen good volume growth in our orthopedics. Our total joint business for the quarter was up 6%. In many instances, we fully absorbed, we believe, most of the shift over the last 3 years during the pandemic, with the orthopedic business moving from inpatient to outpatient. And in most instances, we believe the large majority of that is behind us. And so we don't have that as a pressure point like we have had over the past 3 years. But nonetheless, we have grown that business in the face of the site of care shift. We have a very robust pipeline for our emergency rooms, especially our freestanding emergency room platform, a very significant development opportunity there for us across our communities, and we are investing in that. Our urgent care center platform continues to grow. We are up to 260 urgent care centers. We will probably push through 300 in 2023. Our ambulatory surgery center platform continues to grow. Here, again, we have more de novo development inside of our ambulatory surgery center platform than we have had in the past, and we are encouraged by how that fits into our networks in a very productive way. So, we are really pretty excited about our investments in our ambulatory network, our investments in our acuity programs and our higher service lines. And we will continue to \u2013 we believe, be well positioned to deal with the growing demand that we see in the market. Why don't you take, Bill, the last question? So, our hiring in 2022 was up a little north of 6%, just a huge number of new hires. And so that's the total number just as a starting point. Where that is coming from, that's coming from new grads. There still is a decent pipeline of new graduate nurses in our communities. We have academic partnerships with different colleges beyond Galen that are important to that pipeline. We are also seeing some travelers decide that, okay, enough, we traveled, we want to come back, and we have been able to recover some of the employees who traveled for a period of time back into our organization. So, we continue to be focused on trying to recover them. And I think again, with our benefits and with our wage adjustments and all the investments we are making in clinical education and other components of our labor agenda, we are starting to see more favorable trends in our recruitment function that we think, if they carry into 2023 and through the year, should be positive for us. For M&A, we have been fairly active in the market with outpatient acquisitions again when they come available, whether it's urgent care, some freestanding emergency room, some ASC, some physician clinics and so forth. And those are very complementary, synergistic to our network acquisitions, and we will continue to pursue those as they develop. We have not had too many opportunities on hospital acquisitions. Although, recently there was an announced LOI on a hospital just outside of the Dallas-Fort Worth market that we think is synergistic with respect to clinical services and so forth with our system in Dallas-Fort Worth. So, we will continue to look for those. We do have a pipeline of Greenfield hospitals because the acquisition environment is not as robust end market as maybe we would have hoped. So, we need to consider Greenfield projects, and we do have a number of those that are in the works. We have one under construction currently in San Antonio. And I want to say we have seven or eight parcels of land, maybe 10, that are designed for future hospital development when the time is right for us to make those investments. It's hard for us to really judge the \u2013 whether there is demand on the sidelines, and we don't see it. I mean we get some anecdotal information from our physicians who might indicate that, okay, their clinic patient profiles were better in the fourth quarter than they were at any point in time in 2022. I don't know if that's a precursor or not for pent-up elective surgical demand. I think we are just going to have to wait and see. But I believe it's a positive metric and a positive anecdote that their clinic roles, patient roles appear to be at a higher level than they were in previous parts of 2022. We have, I want to say, Bill, maybe 70% of our contracts for 2024 contracted. I will tell you that most of the contracts, if not all of the contracts we closed in the last three quarters of \u201822 were in line with our expectations, which was around mid-single digit inflators. So, those have to work their way into the \u201823 portfolio of contracts and on into the 2024. So, we are encouraged by the outcomes of those negotiations. I think there is a general recognition in the payer community that the input costs for providers is up, or up. And so given those inflationary pressures, they recognize that there is a sensitivity to respond to that. And we are trying to be appropriate in our app. And I think that's been received well, and we have been able to close these contracts reasonably timely. So, we still have 30% or so of 2023 that will get negotiated over the first part of this year, and will carry us through all of \u201823 and into \u201824. We are about 40% contracted on \u201824. Again, the tail effect of some of the closed contract negotiations that we have just achieved will carry into 2024. Well, thank you for the question. Our teams and our supply chain teams have done an incredible job over the past 12 months to 18 months on our supply cost portfolio, and especially with the backdrop of inflationary increases. And we have talked about through the year, we have been really seeing really positive trends in and actually to keep our supply cost growth below our revenue growth. Much of that was because some of our contracts, 60% of our contracts or so was under firm pricing for the most of \u201822. As we look forward, I think our basic assumption is to continue to keep our supply cost as a percent of revenue flat from where we ran full year \u201823. That would imply our supply cost per unit is somewhere around that 2% level, plus or minus a little bit. But again, we are expecting continued good results in that. And again, our team is doing a nice job. We can keep that supply cost as a percent of revenue flat with where we ran this year, with the backdrop of inflationary that's pretty positive. We have a number of initiatives underway that our teams use. Part of our benchmarking initiatives is to look at utilization and identify best practices across the organization. We also are looking at product selection, partnering with our clinical teams. So, we have a number of initiatives underneath our supply chain operations that are helping us to achieve those results, and we look forward to those continuing as we go into \u201823."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today\u2019s call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today\u2019s press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning\u2019s call, we may refer to measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Inc. is included in today\u2019s release. This morning\u2019s call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Good morning. Thanks for joining the call. As I\u2019ve mentioned on past calls, it has been difficult over the pandemic period to judge our business trends because of the ups and downs we have experienced with the various COVID-19 surges. If you recall, the third quarter of 2021 was the most intense surge we saw with the Delta variant, and it significantly influenced our business, making it difficult to compare. We believe the second quarter and the third quarter of this year provide us with the most sustained period yet for us to judge our business. Generally, the financial results in the third quarter were in line with our internal expectations. As compared to the second quarter, our revenue production was consistent with overall volumes, payer mix and acuity generally stable. These results were generated with capacity constraints in certain situations caused by ongoing labor market challenges. In the quarter, we continued to invest significantly in our workforce including the opening of one more Galen College of Nursing campus. These investments produced improvement in retention, more new hires and reduced contract labor expenses. Overall, operating margins were solid and were a positive reflection on the disciplined execution by our teams. I want to thank them for their enduring commitment to our patients and our facilities. We continue to be impressed by the resolve and dedication. These attributes were once again put to the test with Hurricane Ian. Fortunately, no patient or employee was harmed during the storm. And with the help of our partners, all facilities with the exception of one are fully operational. In the face of disasters, whether a pandemic or a hurricane, the people of HCA Healthcare continue to shine. Normally, on this call, we attempt to provide you with some early perspectives on the upcoming year. Currently, we have reasonable insights into certain aspects of our business such as demand, which we believe will grow around 1% to 2% next year. We also expect payer mix and acuity to remain stable. However, with respect to inflation, we are less certain. We have responded to these unprecedented inflationary and macroeconomic pressures, and we will continue to respond with our workforce initiatives and our financial resiliency program, but it is too early to judge the effectiveness of our response as these forces and the related governmental responses continue to evolve and impact various categories of our costs. Therefore, we will refrain from providing the typical early outlook for 2023 until we finish our planning process in early January. By then, we will have seen another three months of performance to assess the overall environment as well as our response to it. I will close with this. We continue our work to position the Company for long-term success and sustained stakeholder and shareholder value. Our strategic plan is designed to optimize the networks we have built over the years by resourcing them with better technology and analytics, new and innovative care models and a highly trained workforce. We believe these efforts position us well to grow and effectively leverage our deployed capital. But more importantly, they position us better to deliver on our mission and provide higher quality care to our patients in a more efficient manner. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill. Thank you.\nBill Rutherford: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional comments on the quarter. As Sam mentioned, our results in the third quarter were in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.902 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.4%, and diluted earnings per share was $3.93, excluding losses on sale of facilities of $0.02. Our same facility volume levels in the third quarter were generally consistent with our second quarter levels. Our volume trends compared to the prior year reflect the COVID-19 surge we experienced in the prior year. For example, our same facility admissions are down 1.5% when compared to the prior year. COVID admissions were down almost 60% this quarter compared to third quarter of last year, and they represented almost 13% of admissions in Q3 of last year versus 5% of admissions in third quarter of this year. Non-COVID admissions increased 6.9% in the quarter as compared to the prior year and are up 2.7% year-to-date. Acuity and payer mix levels were generally consistent with second quarter levels as well and led to comparable revenue per equivalent admission between the second and third quarter. As mentioned in our release, we recorded approximately $266 million of revenue and $125 million of expenses related to the Florida directed payment program during the quarter. Approval for this program was received in September from CMS for the annual period ending September 30, 2022. In addition, we estimate the impact of Hurricane Ian, which made landfall on the West Coast of Florida on September 28th, was approximately $35 million in the quarter. Our labor costs were generally in line with our expectations. We made market-based wage adjustments for our employee workforce and were able to absorb much of this with a 19% reduction in contract labor as compared to the second quarter. Supply cost trends remained stable, both sequentially and when compared to the prior year. Other operating expenses increased sequentially from the second quarter but this is mostly due to the Florida DPP expenses and some increases in professional fees and utility costs. We remain focused on our resiliency programs that we\u2019ve spoken to in past calls. And overall, our teams are doing a great job responding to the inflationary market dynamics while also identifying efficiency opportunities. Let me transition to discuss some cash flow and balance sheet metrics, which continue to be a strength for HCA Healthcare. Our cash flow from operations was $3.02 billion in the quarter, and capital spending was $1.13 billion. We completed approximately $700 million of share repurchase during the quarter and just under $5.5 billion year-to-date. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was just above the low end of our stated leverage range, and we had approximately $3.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Lastly, I will mention that our full year 2022 guidance remains unchanged. So, with that, let me turn the call back over to Sam for some quick comments before we go to Q&A.\nSam Hazen: Yes. One thing I wanted to share are the themes that we believe are takeaways from our quarter and sort of the normal business trends that we were judging between the second and third quarter. And these themes are as follows: first, again, we think our top line metrics are stable and normal seasonality patterns are beginning to show themselves; number two, we are making progress on our human resource agenda, our engagement levels are up, and so we\u2019re encouraged by that; number three, inflation is real. It\u2019s a pressure point, but we\u2019re working our way through it with our resiliency agenda and other initiatives; and then fourth is that long-term growth prospects, we believe exist across our portfolio. So those things, we think, are important to our judgment of the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and as we look to push forward on into next year and the years thereafter. So with that, Frank, I\u2019ll turn it over to you for questions.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Sam. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so that we may give as many as possible in the queue an opportunity to ask a question. Dennis, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question today comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. One maybe a technical point. Are you just -- commenting on Hurricane Ian and the impact in the early part of the fourth quarter. And then broader question is around your surgery volumes. You clearly showed good trends inpatient versus a year ago outpatient consistent with what you\u2019ve shown year-to-date. I\u2019m assuming that some of that relates to what was happening last year with the Delta surge. But, can you give us some flavor for where you\u2019re at inpatient-outpatient, and are we sort of back to a normal environment there? It sounds like you think you might see a step-up in the fourth quarter just from a normal seasonal pattern, but any comments there?\nSam Hazen: Well, A.J., this is Sam. I\u2019ll let Bill comment on the first question around Hurricane Ian in the fourth quarter. I mean, we had two facilities -- let me back up on Hurricane Ian, just to give everybody some perspective. We did evacuate, I think it was four hospitals in the Tampa, St. Pete area when we believed the storm was going to hit further north. When the storm ultimately moved south on as we were able to move out our most critically ill patients out of two hospitals, and those two hospitals were hit pretty hard in Charlotte County. One of those hospitals suffered a pretty significant damage and we were able to get aspects of it opened already. Our emergency room is back open, one of our med-surg floors is back open, and we think will be fully operational by the end of the year. Our teams in West Florida division and really North Florida did an incredible job at responding to a really impactful hurricane. So that influenced our results in the third quarter. Our volumes were down obviously in the West Florida division, in the North Florida division, which overseas Orlando. So, we had a lot of preparation in management in advance of the storm. So, it had a modest impact on our volumes. With respect to seasonality, we do believe that normal seasonal patterns are starting to exist. And that typically yields more activity in the fourth quarter on outpatient surgery than the third quarter. So, we\u2019re anticipating that, yes. And we are seeing normal patterns, we think, on other aspects of our business with respect to surgeries, cardiac procedures and so forth. And so, that gives us some ability to judge where we are and what initiatives are working. I think it\u2019s important, A.J., to understand that our capacity constraints in the third quarter were real. And some of that was the typical challenges we\u2019ve had over the last 2.5 years in managing capacity. But, we believe that we can continue to open more capacity as we move through the last part of this year and on into next year. But in the quarter, we declined in many instances because we weren\u2019t able to accommodate the patients, approximately 1% to 1.5% of our total admissions simply because of capacity constraints. So, we need to resolve those. Again, the progress that we\u2019re making on our HR agenda we believe is going to help us maintain sufficient capacity to take care of the patients who need our services. So, we\u2019ll continue to push on those agendas and we\u2019re encouraged, though, by the progress that we\u2019re making.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nPito Chickering: I understand that you don\u2019t want to give sort of 2023 guidance at this point, but can you help us sort of quantify a couple of things? How should we think about top line growth next year? You talked about sort of 1% or 2% demand. Where do you expect the pricing to be, any color on managed care price increases in 2023 versus 2022? Now, on the cost side of the equation, what are you seeing for full-time inflation in the fourth quarter this year? I think that evolves next year. Any color on sort of how new grads coming out of nursing schools, decreases contract labor? And then any sort of thoughts around non-labor inflation next year that you can give some color on? Thanks so much.\nBill Rutherford: Well, Pito, this is Bill. Let me try. I mean, I think Sam gave you comments on our thinking about top line. And really, the uncertainty remains around inflationary trends. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. Take the balance of the year, coupled with our experience so far to get some informed judgment as we go into 2023. So, it\u2019s a bit too early to provide too many details. We\u2019re pleased with the continuation of labor agenda. We\u2019re pleased with the continuation of reductions of contract labor. And we\u2019re just going to have to judge the overall inflationary environment as we go into 2023. We think our teams and our resiliency efforts are good countermeasures to that. But that\u2019s what we\u2019re taking a little bit more time to kind of be able to judge that, and we\u2019ll give you a full commentary in January.\nSam Hazen: I think just to add a point to the third quarter as compared to the second quarter, our salary, wages and benefit cost per hour were flat with the second quarter. That was partially due to a 20% reduction in contract expenses. And at the same time, our normal wage timing for adjustments for our employees happens in the third quarter. And so, we were able to absorb that with the management of our contract labor expenses. So, that was encouraging. That\u2019s the first quarter in a while where we\u2019ve seen stabilization in our labor cost per hour when you mix all components of our labor costs. So, we\u2019ll continue to hopefully make some strides in that area and moderate some of the pressures, Pito, that exist in the labor market as we continue to execute on our recruitment agenda, our retention agenda, our capacity management and so forth.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nAnn Hynes: Your volume guidance for next year is 1% to 2%. And I believe that\u2019s a little lower than historically, you typically guide 2% to 3%. Can you just talk about that and maybe what procedures aren\u2019t coming back or why you feel like it\u2019s not going to be a normal year since COVID admissions, while they still exist, aren\u2019t at the height they used to be?\nSam Hazen: I think for -- this is Sam, Ann. I think the 1% to 2% is a little bit lower than maybe historical trends because we will have some COVID admission activity in \u201822 that we don\u2019t think will be as much in \u201823. So, if you normalize for COVID, it\u2019s sort of in the zone of what our historical trends have been. We think outpatient activity would be a little stronger than inpatient activity as it has been historically. But we do see, with the strong markets that we have and with the investments that we\u2019re making in our network that we should be able to achieve those normal trends when you normalize for some of the COVID activity, which we don\u2019t anticipate at the same level next year. So that\u2019s part of the explanation. There\u2019s still a little bit of the influence there from COVID.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on 2022. So first, in the -- your update -- you didn\u2019t update guidance. I assume that means that it remained intact. Just curious, given we\u2019re three quarters through, where you think within that guidance range you might end up? And then in the third quarter, to your point, COVID admissions were fluctuated pretty good. I was hoping you might be able to give us a revenue per admission number ex-COVID, just so we can see what the growth is doing ex that big swing in COVID. Thanks a lot.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Justin, this is Bill. Let me -- on guidance first. Yes, we\u2019re maintaining our previous guidance, which does accommodate a wider range of outcomes than we might typically have at this point in the year. But given the uncertainties in the environment that we\u2019ve talked about, we think it\u2019s appropriate at this time, and we\u2019ll just continue to manage our way through the balance of the year. Relative to non-COVID revenue for adjusted admission, we saw growth in both, overall as well as managed care. If you bear with me for a minute, I\u2019ll get you the exact number. So yes, we were up about 2 points on revenue per adjusted admission on the non-COVID for the quarter.\nJustin Lake: And Bill, that would strip out the Florida revenues as well?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, it would be.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gary Taylor with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Two quick ones. The first is, when we think about some of the headwinds for \u201823 that you talked about before, the Texas out of period, some of the COVID reimbursement, et cetera. Does the Florida DPP, does that constitute a headwind for \u201823, or is that a program if it\u2019s you\u2019d expect to continue such that the annual number is the same? And then, my second question is -- I hear your comments on inflation. And obviously, we look at the pretty good labor performance this quarter and supply cost per adjusted patient actually down year-over-year. So, are you signaling that there\u2019s a new inflection point in inflation that you\u2019re concerned about for \u201823? And is that in the labor, or is that in other operating, so it\u2019s utilities and insurance and that sort of thing?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Hey Gary, this is Bill. Let me address the Florida DPP. We are not anticipating that to be a headwind next year. That is an annual program, have received annual approval. So, we are subject to approval. But, as you might recall, we reported some amounts in the fourth quarter of last year. And with this amount, we would, at this point, anticipate that program will continue, and it\u2019s material for next year, but we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that.\nSam Hazen: Yes. And Gary, this is Sam. On inflation, we\u2019re not really signaling anything. We\u2019re just suggesting that we want to go three more months and understand the progress that we hope to make with our labor agenda and some of our other efforts. And that will give us, hopefully, 9, 10 months\u2019 worth of normal run of business. Again, we haven\u2019t had that for three years. And that will help inform where we think the market is, where we think our initiatives are and how that\u2019s positioning us for \u201823, and we\u2019ll give you more specificity at that particular point in time on the different cost categories and inflationary pressures that exist within each of those.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Mok with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Mok: I understand you\u2019re not commenting on 2023 at this point, but can you help us understand the level of nonrecurring benefits in 2022, so we can bridge to a proper 2022 baseline? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Well, I mean, we\u2019ve talked publicly before around the Texas out-of-period amounts that we recorded earlier in the year that related to last year. That was approximately $150 million. And then, we\u2019ve sized the various COVID support payments we received this year that we don\u2019t anticipate to continue around $300 million. And so, those would be the two areas we\u2019ve talked about before. And there is other pluses and minuses, 340B is out there. But those are the two things that I would highlight at this point.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Whit Mayo with SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: Thanks. I just want to go back to contract labor for a minute. I appreciate the disclosure that it declined 19%. Can you maybe frame that as a percentage of SWB in the third quarter and also maybe what the exit rate is? And also, Bill, your comment on market-based wage adjustments, is there any way to maybe quantify that on an FTE basis or a per hour basis, just to put into perspective the level of inflation that you\u2019re seeing and how different that is maybe from the beginning of the year? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Whit, on the contract labor percent of SWB was about 7.2% for the quarter, and that\u2019s pretty much close to our exit rate, as you say, for the quarter. So that\u2019s a good improvement. Roughly speaking, half of that was through the continued reduction of the average hourly rate and half though reduction of utilization of contract labor. So, we\u2019re very pleased with those trends going forward.\nSam Hazen: Yes. Typically -- Whit, this is Sam. We give our wage increases in the third quarter. It varies a little bit market to market. But that\u2019s when the lion\u2019s share of our increases go through. And we\u2019ve been a little bit active throughout the last year or so with targeted market adjustments here and there throughout the year, but we felt we needed to be a little bit more significant. So, we -- the composite is a little north of 4%. If you look at third quarter to second quarter, as far as average hourly rate increases for our employed forces. Again, that\u2019s just the third quarter to second quarter, and we were able to absorb that inside of our contract labor expense management and yielded again labor cost as a composite flat with the third quarter compared to the second quarter. We still are running with a lot more nurses in contract labor than we did in 2019. So, we have room to go, we believe. We obviously have to execute on our human resource agenda to make that happen. And we\u2019ve invested heavily in our recruitment capabilities, and they\u2019ve done a wonderful job of improving our recruitment processing and really creating a better applicant experience as well as a better management experience for our management teams out there. We have very intentional retention efforts, including compensation and benefits and flexible scheduling and so forth in order to improve retention, and we\u2019re seeing progress there. Our engagement results just came in, very positive. So we\u2019re really encouraged by our abilities to capitalize on modifying our workforce over time. That can change. We understand that, but at this particular juncture, that\u2019s where we are.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: One of your -- your competitor noted an increase in clinicians out on quarantine this quarter, and clearly, they had an impact on agency labor, and you seem to have managed obviously agency labor much better. And I\u2019m wondering what you saw in terms of staff quarantine rates and -- this quarter versus prior? And how were you able to manage that? And if you saw any scheduling delays on the outpatient electives as a result of changing quarantine rates? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. Thank you for that question. We -- I don\u2019t know of any quarantine issues that we experienced in the third quarter this year. Obviously, last year with the Delta variant, we had a number of our staff who were out on quarantine. But this year, that has not surfaced as an issue for us across our divisions. I mean, I\u2019m sure there were some people who experienced some COVID in our workforce, but it wasn\u2019t a significant piece of issue for us.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. So, could you talk a little bit about rate negotiations with managed care? What progress you\u2019re seeing on that? And maybe if you can give some context on the market environment, if you\u2019re seeing any smaller hospitals that are terming contracts or if you, in fact, termed any contracts? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Well, we\u2019ve mentioned in the past that we felt the inflationary pressures that we\u2019re incurring on our cost structure are being received reasonably well by the payer community. And that has, in fact, happened. We closed some additional contracts in the third quarter of this year, and they were generally in the target of where we had indicated previously that we expected our new contracts to land, and that was somewhere in the mid-single-digits. So, we are making progress with respect to our renegotiations. As I mentioned, we were already partially negotiated for 2023, and we continue to add to that negotiation in contract completion rate as we move through the third quarter. So, we\u2019re encouraged by the renegotiations that have occurred, and we are about 70% contracted for 2023 and about 45% contracted for 2024, and we\u2019re seeing elevated escalators by comparison to our historical trends on our commercial contract book. As it relates to our competitors, there\u2019s always pockets of negotiations where there\u2019s terminations and so forth. We have not had to terminate any contracts in any significant fashion. We\u2019ve been able to reach agreements that work for us and work for the payers, and we\u2019ll continue to hopefully be able to make that happen. We are working with the payers with respect to making sure that our accounts receivables are handled timely and appropriately with respect to denials and so forth, and we are incorporating that into our discussions in a way that we think will be productive for us and hopefully productive for the payers.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrian Tanquilut: Sam, I appreciate you guys providing some insight into next year\u2019s volume expectations. But, as we stare down a recession here, I mean, how are you thinking about the resilience of the business? You guys did fairly well during the last recession, but just some thoughts on that and maybe your thoughts on any differences this time around versus \u201807 to 2012?\nSam Hazen: Well, I think the most material difference, and I mentioned this on the last earnings call we had is that the Affordable Care Act and the exchange community provides a potential safety net that heretofore in previous recessionary cycles we didn\u2019t have. And that, for us, we believe, is a positive. As it relates to the other aspects of our business, our demand for healthcare services tends to lag the rest of the economy and we tend to see demand in the earlier part of a recessionary cycle sort of hold, and that was when people were under COBRA benefits and so forth and then it would fade over time. But with the Affordable Care Act and the support that the exchanges provide, we\u2019re not sure how to gauge that at this particular juncture, because it\u2019s a new dynamic, but we believe it to be a favorable dynamic. So, that would be where we are at this particular point with judging the future impact of a recessionary cycle. I think, our teams are working to with our resiliency agenda and other efforts to anticipate where they can anticipate and make adjustments where they can to put us in the best position to be successful. We think our balance sheet is strong and that should create opportunities for us to invest in certain situations and hopefully gain market share. You look at our markets as a whole, Florida, Texas, Nashville, Vegas. These are fairly strong durable economies, we believe. It may be a little stronger than the nation as a whole. So, that can hopefully add some support as we go into a recessionary cycle potentially in the future.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: I guess, there\u2019s somewhat of a question about how we should be thinking about volume normalization. You guys are above 2019, but you\u2019re probably 4% to 7% below where you would have thought if you were to grow 2% to 3% every year up to 2019. And it looks like you\u2019re still talking about that growth rate being below average again next year. I mean, how are you -- it sounds like you\u2019re saying you think that demand in your markets is durable, but it still feels like you\u2019re getting farther and farther away from that trend line in the near term. So, can you just help us frame how we should be thinking about that? Is it labor that is the gating factor to getting back there? Are there other things -- and how long if that trend line is the right way to think about it, I guess you can say that or not? But if it is the right way to think about it, how are you thinking about what has to happen to get us back to that trend line?\nSam Hazen: Let me make a couple of comments. I do think there is an imbalance between supply of healthcare and demand for healthcare right now, primarily because of some of the labor constraints. And people are being pushed out, they\u2019re being held up. Again, transfers are not happening as we had anticipated. So, there is some influence to that. Anecdotally, we\u2019ve heard from some of our physicians that their clinic practices are starting to recover in ways that maybe earlier in the year, they didn\u2019t recover. So that\u2019s encouraging to us at some level. Obviously, during the comparison of 2019 to today, our total joint business migrated fairly significantly to outpatient activity. When you look at 2019, on the outpatient side against the third quarter of 2022, we think our outpatient activity has grown 5% or 6% over that time period. Our inpatient activity is down a little bit, most of which is explained by the total joint movement. So, we were asking ourselves when you think about it, did that business go away or not. So, I think when you look at our non-COVID admission activity, which year-to-date has grown 3% and grown a little bit more even in the commercial business, it is actually sequentially growing third quarter to second quarter. That gives us encouragement that we\u2019re moving closer to the historical trend. Again, we have a little bit of COVID influence this year because we had activity in the first quarter and a little bit of activity this quarter. But, when we look at non-COVID by itself, we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing. ER visits have rebounded and shown a great deal of resiliency. So, we think it\u2019s migrating closer to the historical trend than not.\nKevin Fischbeck: Would you say then that the hip knee move-out is something that\u2019s unusual, or I mean there\u2019s always a shift to outpatient every...\nSam Hazen: Yes, there are always some elements of it. I think that more pronounced one that we\u2019ve seen in a long time.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Question just around, obviously, another one of the sort of uncertain swing factors for 2023 is just around the public health emergency and whether that gets finally pulled back or not. Can you just remind us for HCA again, just what the key impacts or benefits that you\u2019ve been seeing from the PHE would be? And how that would factor into your thinking for next year, would you ultimately see the public health emergency go away? Clearly, return of redeterminations in Medicaid is probably the biggest item, but just any others as well would be helpful. Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Scott, this is Bill. I think the primary was coded add-on to the DRG payments that we\u2019ve spoken about. Given the COVID volume has kind of moderated, that hasn\u2019t been material for us. So, that\u2019s the area there. As you said, then the next area and probably more significant is just if it does -- when it does expire, what the Medicaid redetermination process will occur by various states. We\u2019ve evaluated that. We\u2019ve got, I think, good planning exercise around this. So, those would be the I think consequences or effects of the PHE, not material on the DRG add-on at this point, and then we\u2019ll prepare ourselves to go through Medicaid redeterminations.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Cassorla: Great. Thanks, and good morning. Just related to fourth quarter, I guess, COVID has trended higher so far this year than perhaps your previous expectations. But, can you help on how you\u2019re thinking about COVID activity for fourth quarter and if you\u2019re thinking if it will accelerate versus this quarter? And then, also, just what your expectations are for flu trends, maybe just in guidance and for 4Q? And how we should think about what an elevated flu environment would mean for this year, maybe just in context of the current labor backdrop and versus historical flu seasons? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. I\u2019ll start with COVID. We don\u2019t have specific fourth quarter projections. As I said in my comments, we ran about 5% of our admissions in the third quarter. We ran about 3% in the second. So, my intuition says somewhere between those areas might be an area we see in the fourth quarter on there. In terms of flu volumes, again, we haven\u2019t made any specific projections for flu, but clearly, we\u2019re paying attention to the flu volumes that are out there in the anticipation that it might be a busy flu season. But I don\u2019t think that necessarily changes the trajectory of our fourth quarter compared to what we previously thought.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJohn Ransom: Hey. Good morning I\u2019m just thinking about sequential labor trends from 3Q to 4Q. And I heard you say you gave the 5% -- 4% [ph] update in 3Q. Does 4Q look flattish if you account for maybe continued reduction in temp labor, or if you hit a plateau in that 7 percentage range that you talked about?\nBill Rutherford: Well, I think it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to see that -- the contract labor levels, we feel good about, not only the progress we\u2019ve made this year, as you know, we hovered around 9% in the early part in terms of contract labor percent of SWB down to 7%. We think we can stay in that range for the balance of the year. And so, yes, I think we feel generally positive about the labor environment we\u2019re in. Too early to call specifically about is it flat, is there some growth. But I think we think can hold the majority of the contract labor trends, some incremental improvement with utilization as we continue to see recruitment and retention improve. So again, I think we\u2019ll just have to see how it turns out, but we\u2019re feeling positive about the labor agenda at this point.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Raskin: I was wondering, Bill, if you could give us an update on your returns that you\u2019re seeing on your capital expenditures, maybe how you\u2019re thinking about spend into 2023. And maybe related to capital, anything we should read into the lower share repurchases in the last quarter here?\nBill Rutherford: No. This is -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything you should read into that. And in terms of capital returns, we continue to see good projects to deploy capital. We continue to believe our total capital spending this year will hover around $4.2 billion. We\u2019re in the planning stages for next year, but I anticipate it stays materially in that range. And I think that is an indication of the opportunities we continue to see to put capital to work, to meet what will be a growing demand in both, inpatient capacity as well as outpatient and program development. And again, I think with the cash profile of HCA, we\u2019ve got a pretty balanced allocation of capital. The balance sheet is in a great position. I think our share repurchase program this year will hover around $7 billion for the full year. So, again, I think it\u2019s strong allocation of capital. We\u2019re intending to drive reasonable returns going forward.\nJoshua Raskin: And Bill, I think you\u2019ve said in the past something around north of 15% total, total return on CapEx, including maintenance and growth. Is that still the right range? Are you guys still generating sort of mid-teens returns on those CapEx projects?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. I mean, obviously, each project varies. But when I step up and look at our overall return on invested capital, we\u2019re in the high teens. So, that we\u2019re encouraged by the net effect of all of our investment decisions.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJamie Perse: I wanted to see if you could talk about length of stay. It\u2019s still quite elevated versus 2019. What are the key bottlenecks you\u2019re facing, both on inpatient throughput as well as discharge? Do you think those will go away over the course of 2023? And what does that mean in terms of your capacity expansion and also managing costs on a per patient day or per admission basis?\nSam Hazen: I think one thing. This is Sam. That\u2019s important to understand. Our length of stay is up over 2019. But our case mix is up even more. So, when you look at our length of stay on a case mix adjusted basis, it\u2019s actually down. So, that\u2019s encouraging. Now, we have opportunities. We have significant opportunities, we believe, with better case management protocols, better use of technology, better partnerships with subacute providers and our own providers in that space to really improve the throughput in our facility. Just this past week, actually, we had an update on our case management agenda, and we continue to be encouraged by the progress incrementally that they\u2019re making. And we think as we move on into 2023, that will continue. That is a key part of our capacity management and labor management as well. So, it\u2019s got a lot of efficiencies connected to it. But, we have significantly increased our case mix over 2019, and that\u2019s influenced our length of stay somewhat as well. But, I believe our overall program, which is a key ingredient to our resiliency effort is, in fact, adding value and will continue to add value for our patients as well as for the efficiency and the throughput within our facilities.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Calvin Sternick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nCalvin Sternick: Yes. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I think you noted the impact that capacity had on volumes in the quarter. Just curious, I guess, one, if you think that\u2019s going to be relatively consistent going into the fourth quarter? And then, it looks like same-store ER visits picked up a bit sequentially. Just curious, are you starting to see some more episodic care start to bounce back in that setting? And has there been any shift in the payer mix you\u2019re seeing there? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Well, we will still have some capacity constraints in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m hopeful that we will relieve some of it with our recruitment agenda and the fact that we\u2019re adding more headcount and opening beds. I think also, as I just mentioned, our case management efforts will create capacity for us as well. So -- but I do anticipate us having some closures here and there with respect to being able to take new patients at certain times. It just unfortunately happened at this at this particular point. And it happened pre-pandemic, but on a much lower level than it is today. As it relates to the ER, we\u2019ve been impressed by how resilient our emergency room services are. We continue to work on our operations and our throughput within our emergency rooms so we can take care of people as they deserve to be taken care of. We\u2019ve added capacity with our overall platform of emergency room offerings inside of our hospitals as well as some of our freestanding facilities, and that\u2019s been important to our outreach in that area. We believe fundamentally that the emergency room is a key ingredient to the healthcare system overall, and it provides a very important 24/7, 365 capability for our communities. And so, we\u2019re still investing, as I mentioned, in our emergency rooms in very selective ways in order to make sure that we have the right supply available for what we believe to be growing demand.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: I wanted to ask about the mix of outpatient revenue in the quarter. It looks like that stepped down a bit more than you might have expected in a typical year. What should we think about as the key drivers of that? I guess, with some distance, does it look like Q2 might have benefited from some pent-up demand? And it doesn\u2019t sound like it based on your comments, but any impact you\u2019d flag from outpatient surgeries moving back to inpatient at least maybe compared to earlier in the year? Thank you.\nBill Rutherford: No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything structurally. I think the outpatient of revenue last year was busy during the Delta COVID -- the Delta surge and inpatient capacity was being managed and constrained and potentially, we saw more activity in outpatient of second quarter last year. But in terms of sequential trends, we don\u2019t see anything structurally different going on between Q3 and Q2 on outpatient trends.\nOperator: And today\u2019s final question comes from the line of Sarah James with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Has there been a lift to acuity mix in \u201822 from some of the low acuity falling off related to consumer reactions, either COVID or the economy? And what would that do to revenue per admission as it normalizes? And then, just a quick clarification. Earlier you mentioned the 24 payer contract has labor cost escalators, can you clarify if that\u2019s a static or dynamic? Because I think some of the acuities we\u2019re talking about dynamic escalators coming in to reflect labor cost fluctuations.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. I\u2019ll answer the last question. Most of our inflators are static. We do have some contracts that have corridors, if you want to call that, or dynamic components to it with respect to inflation. So, most of our 24 will be more of a static inflator that we negotiate on the front end. And so, that\u2019s how most of our contracts are structured.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. In terms of the case mix, I mean, we\u2019re seeing some growth in our no-COVID case mix trends. We\u2019ve been -- case mix has been stable for us. So, we haven\u2019t noticed any remarkable decline in that. In the COVID business, obviously, COVID ran a higher case mix in our non-COVID, so that\u2019s been a factor. But, when we look at basic trends or the acuity levels have been stable, but mostly between Q3 and Q2. So, we\u2019re reading that as a fairly positive indicator.\nSarah James: Okay. So there\u2019s not a falloff of low acuity non-COVID just from people either worried about the economy or COVID that\u2019s kind of...\nBill Rutherford: No, we\u2019re not seeing anything of that trend at this stage.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.\nFrank Morgan: Dennis, thank you so much for your help today. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call. Hope you have a wonderful weekend. I\u2019m around this afternoon, if I can answer any additional questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes the HCA Healthcare third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional comments on the quarter. As Sam mentioned, our results in the third quarter were in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.902 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.4%, and diluted earnings per share was $3.93, excluding losses on sale of facilities of $0.02. Our same facility volume levels in the third quarter were generally consistent with our second quarter levels. Our volume trends compared to the prior year reflect the COVID-19 surge we experienced in the prior year. For example, our same facility admissions are down 1.5% when compared to the prior year. COVID admissions were down almost 60% this quarter compared to third quarter of last year, and they represented almost 13% of admissions in Q3 of last year versus 5% of admissions in third quarter of this year. Non-COVID admissions increased 6.9% in the quarter as compared to the prior year and are up 2.7% year-to-date. Acuity and payer mix levels were generally consistent with second quarter levels as well and led to comparable revenue per equivalent admission between the second and third quarter. As mentioned in our release, we recorded approximately $266 million of revenue and $125 million of expenses related to the Florida directed payment program during the quarter. Approval for this program was received in September from CMS for the annual period ending September 30, 2022. In addition, we estimate the impact of Hurricane Ian, which made landfall on the West Coast of Florida on September 28th, was approximately $35 million in the quarter. Our labor costs were generally in line with our expectations. We made market-based wage adjustments for our employee workforce and were able to absorb much of this with a 19% reduction in contract labor as compared to the second quarter. Supply cost trends remained stable, both sequentially and when compared to the prior year. Other operating expenses increased sequentially from the second quarter but this is mostly due to the Florida DPP expenses and some increases in professional fees and utility costs. We remain focused on our resiliency programs that we've spoken to in past calls. And overall, our teams are doing a great job responding to the inflationary market dynamics while also identifying efficiency opportunities. Let me transition to discuss some cash flow and balance sheet metrics, which continue to be a strength for HCA Healthcare. Our cash flow from operations was $3.02 billion in the quarter, and capital spending was $1.13 billion. We completed approximately $700 million of share repurchase during the quarter and just under $5.5 billion year-to-date. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was just above the low end of our stated leverage range, and we had approximately $3.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Lastly, I will mention that our full year 2022 guidance remains unchanged. So, with that, let me turn the call back over to Sam for some quick comments before we go to Q&A. Well, Pito, this is Bill. Let me try. I mean, I think Sam gave you comments on our thinking about top line. And really, the uncertainty remains around inflationary trends. And that's what we're looking at. Take the balance of the year, coupled with our experience so far to get some informed judgment as we go into 2023. So, it's a bit too early to provide too many details. We're pleased with the continuation of labor agenda. We're pleased with the continuation of reductions of contract labor. And we're just going to have to judge the overall inflationary environment as we go into 2023. We think our teams and our resiliency efforts are good countermeasures to that. But that's what we're taking a little bit more time to kind of be able to judge that, and we'll give you a full commentary in January. Yes. Justin, this is Bill. Let me -- on guidance first. Yes, we're maintaining our previous guidance, which does accommodate a wider range of outcomes than we might typically have at this point in the year. But given the uncertainties in the environment that we've talked about, we think it's appropriate at this time, and we'll just continue to manage our way through the balance of the year. Relative to non-COVID revenue for adjusted admission, we saw growth in both, overall as well as managed care. If you bear with me for a minute, I'll get you the exact number. So yes, we were up about 2 points on revenue per adjusted admission on the non-COVID for the quarter. Yes, it would be. Yes. Hey Gary, this is Bill. Let me address the Florida DPP. We are not anticipating that to be a headwind next year. That is an annual program, have received annual approval. So, we are subject to approval. But, as you might recall, we reported some amounts in the fourth quarter of last year. And with this amount, we would, at this point, anticipate that program will continue, and it's material for next year, but we'll continue to evaluate that. Well, I mean, we've talked publicly before around the Texas out-of-period amounts that we recorded earlier in the year that related to last year. That was approximately $150 million. And then, we've sized the various COVID support payments we received this year that we don't anticipate to continue around $300 million. And so, those would be the two areas we've talked about before. And there is other pluses and minuses, 340B is out there. But those are the two things that I would highlight at this point. Yes. Whit, on the contract labor percent of SWB was about 7.2% for the quarter, and that's pretty much close to our exit rate, as you say, for the quarter. So that's a good improvement. Roughly speaking, half of that was through the continued reduction of the average hourly rate and half though reduction of utilization of contract labor. So, we're very pleased with those trends going forward. Yes. Scott, this is Bill. I think the primary was coded add-on to the DRG payments that we've spoken about. Given the COVID volume has kind of moderated, that hasn't been material for us. So, that's the area there. As you said, then the next area and probably more significant is just if it does -- when it does expire, what the Medicaid redetermination process will occur by various states. We've evaluated that. We've got, I think, good planning exercise around this. So, those would be the I think consequences or effects of the PHE, not material on the DRG add-on at this point, and then we'll prepare ourselves to go through Medicaid redeterminations. Yes. I'll start with COVID. We don't have specific fourth quarter projections. As I said in my comments, we ran about 5% of our admissions in the third quarter. We ran about 3% in the second. So, my intuition says somewhere between those areas might be an area we see in the fourth quarter on there. In terms of flu volumes, again, we haven't made any specific projections for flu, but clearly, we're paying attention to the flu volumes that are out there in the anticipation that it might be a busy flu season. But I don't think that necessarily changes the trajectory of our fourth quarter compared to what we previously thought. Well, I think it's something we're going to have to see that -- the contract labor levels, we feel good about, not only the progress we've made this year, as you know, we hovered around 9% in the early part in terms of contract labor percent of SWB down to 7%.

So again, I think we'll just have to see how it turns out, but we're feeling positive about the labor agenda at this point. No. This is -- I don't think there's anything you should read into that. And in terms of capital returns, we continue to see good projects to deploy capital. We continue to believe our total capital spending this year will hover around $4.2 billion. We're in the planning stages for next year, but I anticipate it stays materially in that range. And I think that is an indication of the opportunities we continue to see to put capital to work, to meet what will be a growing demand in both, inpatient capacity as well as outpatient and program development. And again, I think with the cash profile of HCA, we've got a pretty balanced allocation of capital. The balance sheet is in a great position. I think our share repurchase program this year will hover around $7 billion for the full year. So, again, I think it's strong allocation of capital. We're intending to drive reasonable returns going forward. Yes. I mean, obviously, each project varies. But when I step up and look at our overall return on invested capital, we're in the high teens. So, that we're encouraged by the net effect of all of our investment decisions. No, I don't think there's anything structurally. I think the outpatient of revenue last year was busy during the Delta COVID -- the Delta surge and inpatient capacity was being managed and constrained and potentially, we saw more activity in outpatient of second quarter last year. But in terms of sequential trends, we don't see anything structurally different going on between Q3 and Q2 on outpatient trends. Yes. In terms of the case mix, I mean, we're seeing some growth in our no-COVID case mix trends. We've been -- case mix has been stable for us. So, we haven't noticed any remarkable decline in that. In the COVID business, obviously, COVID ran a higher case mix in our non-COVID, so that's been a factor. But, when we look at basic trends or the acuity levels have been stable, but mostly between Q3 and Q2. So, we're reading that as a fairly positive indicator.

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "Good morning. Thanks for joining the call. As I've mentioned on past calls, it has been difficult over the pandemic period to judge our business trends because of the ups and downs we have experienced with the various COVID-19 surges. If you recall, the third quarter of 2021 was the most intense surge we saw with the Delta variant, and it significantly influenced our business, making it difficult to compare. We believe the second quarter and the third quarter of this year provide us with the most sustained period yet for us to judge our business. Generally, the financial results in the third quarter were in line with our internal expectations. As compared to the second quarter, our revenue production was consistent with overall volumes, payer mix and acuity generally stable. These results were generated with capacity constraints in certain situations caused by ongoing labor market challenges. In the quarter, we continued to invest significantly in our workforce including the opening of one more Galen College of Nursing campus. These investments produced improvement in retention, more new hires and reduced contract labor expenses. Overall, operating margins were solid and were a positive reflection on the disciplined execution by our teams. I want to thank them for their enduring commitment to our patients and our facilities. We continue to be impressed by the resolve and dedication. These attributes were once again put to the test with Hurricane Ian. Fortunately, no patient or employee was harmed during the storm. And with the help of our partners, all facilities with the exception of one are fully operational. In the face of disasters, whether a pandemic or a hurricane, the people of HCA Healthcare continue to shine. Normally, on this call, we attempt to provide you with some early perspectives on the upcoming year. Currently, we have reasonable insights into certain aspects of our business such as demand, which we believe will grow around 1% to 2% next year. We also expect payer mix and acuity to remain stable. However, with respect to inflation, we are less certain. We have responded to these unprecedented inflationary and macroeconomic pressures, and we will continue to respond with our workforce initiatives and our financial resiliency program, but it is too early to judge the effectiveness of our response as these forces and the related governmental responses continue to evolve and impact various categories of our costs. Therefore, we will refrain from providing the typical early outlook for 2023 until we finish our planning process in early January. By then, we will have seen another three months of performance to assess the overall environment as well as our response to it. I will close with this. We continue our work to position the Company for long-term success and sustained stakeholder and shareholder value. Our strategic plan is designed to optimize the networks we have built over the years by resourcing them with better technology and analytics, new and innovative care models and a highly trained workforce. We believe these efforts position us well to grow and effectively leverage our deployed capital. But more importantly, they position us better to deliver on our mission and provide higher quality care to our patients in a more efficient manner. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill. Thank you. Yes. One thing I wanted to share are the themes that we believe are takeaways from our quarter and sort of the normal business trends that we were judging between the second and third quarter. And these themes are as follows: first, again, we think our top line metrics are stable and normal seasonality patterns are beginning to show themselves; number two, we are making progress on our human resource agenda, our engagement levels are up, and so we're encouraged by that; number three, inflation is real. It's a pressure point, but we're working our way through it with our resiliency agenda and other initiatives; and then fourth is that long-term growth prospects, we believe exist across our portfolio. So those things, we think, are important to our judgment of the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and as we look to push forward on into next year and the years thereafter. So with that, Frank, I'll turn it over to you for questions. Well, A.J., this is Sam. I'll let Bill comment on the first question around Hurricane Ian in the fourth quarter. I mean, we had two facilities -- let me back up on Hurricane Ian, just to give everybody some perspective. We did evacuate, I think it was four hospitals in the Tampa, St. Pete area when we believed the storm was going to hit further north. When the storm ultimately moved south on as we were able to move out our most critically ill patients out of two hospitals, and those two hospitals were hit pretty hard in Charlotte County. One of those hospitals suffered a pretty significant damage and we were able to get aspects of it opened already. Our emergency room is back open, one of our med-surg floors is back open, and we think will be fully operational by the end of the year. Our teams in West Florida division and really North Florida did an incredible job at responding to a really impactful hurricane. So that influenced our results in the third quarter. Our volumes were down obviously in the West Florida division, in the North Florida division, which overseas Orlando. So, we had a lot of preparation in management in advance of the storm. So, it had a modest impact on our volumes. With respect to seasonality, we do believe that normal seasonal patterns are starting to exist. And that typically yields more activity in the fourth quarter on outpatient surgery than the third quarter. So, we're anticipating that, yes. And we are seeing normal patterns, we think, on other aspects of our business with respect to surgeries, cardiac procedures and so forth. And so, that gives us some ability to judge where we are and what initiatives are working. I think it's important, A.J., to understand that our capacity constraints in the third quarter were real. And some of that was the typical challenges we've had over the last 2.5 years in managing capacity. But, we believe that we can continue to open more capacity as we move through the last part of this year and on into next year. But in the quarter, we declined in many instances because we weren't able to accommodate the patients, approximately 1% to 1.5% of our total admissions simply because of capacity constraints. So, we need to resolve those. Again, the progress that we're making on our HR agenda we believe is going to help us maintain sufficient capacity to take care of the patients who need our services. So, we'll continue to push on those agendas and we're encouraged, though, by the progress that we're making. I think just to add a point to the third quarter as compared to the second quarter, our salary, wages and benefit cost per hour were flat with the second quarter. That was partially due to a 20% reduction in contract expenses. And at the same time, our normal wage timing for adjustments for our employees happens in the third quarter. And so, we were able to absorb that with the management of our contract labor expenses. So, that was encouraging. That's the first quarter in a while where we've seen stabilization in our labor cost per hour when you mix all components of our labor costs. So, we'll continue to hopefully make some strides in that area and moderate some of the pressures, Pito, that exist in the labor market as we continue to execute on our recruitment agenda, our retention agenda, our capacity management and so forth. I think for -- this is Sam, Ann. I think the 1% to 2% is a little bit lower than maybe historical trends because we will have some COVID admission activity in \u201822 that we don't think will be as much in \u201823. So, if you normalize for COVID, it's sort of in the zone of what our historical trends have been. We think outpatient activity would be a little stronger than inpatient activity as it has been historically. But we do see, with the strong markets that we have and with the investments that we're making in our network that we should be able to achieve those normal trends when you normalize for some of the COVID activity, which we don't anticipate at the same level next year. So that's part of the explanation. There's still a little bit of the influence there from COVID. Yes. And Gary, this is Sam. On inflation, we're not really signaling anything. We're just suggesting that we want to go three more months and understand the progress that we hope to make with our labor agenda and some of our other efforts. And that will give us, hopefully, 9, 10 months' worth of normal run of business. Again, we haven't had that for three years. And that will help inform where we think the market is, where we think our initiatives are and how that's positioning us for \u201823, and we'll give you more specificity at that particular point in time on the different cost categories and inflationary pressures that exist within each of those. Yes. Typically -- Whit, this is Sam. We give our wage increases in the third quarter. It varies a little bit market to market. But that's when the lion's share of our increases go through. And we've been a little bit active throughout the last year or so with targeted market adjustments here and there throughout the year, but we felt we needed to be a little bit more significant. So, we -- the composite is a little north of 4%. If you look at third quarter to second quarter, as far as average hourly rate increases for our employed forces. Again, that's just the third quarter to second quarter, and we were able to absorb that inside of our contract labor expense management and yielded again labor cost as a composite flat with the third quarter compared to the second quarter. We still are running with a lot more nurses in contract labor than we did in 2019. So, we have room to go, we believe. We obviously have to execute on our human resource agenda to make that happen. And we've invested heavily in our recruitment capabilities, and they've done a wonderful job of improving our recruitment processing and really creating a better applicant experience as well as a better management experience for our management teams out there. We have very intentional retention efforts, including compensation and benefits and flexible scheduling and so forth in order to improve retention, and we're seeing progress there. Our engagement results just came in, very positive. So we're really encouraged by our abilities to capitalize on modifying our workforce over time. That can change. We understand that, but at this particular juncture, that's where we are. This is Sam. Thank you for that question. We -- I don't know of any quarantine issues that we experienced in the third quarter this year. Obviously, last year with the Delta variant, we had a number of our staff who were out on quarantine. But this year, that has not surfaced as an issue for us across our divisions. I mean, I'm sure there were some people who experienced some COVID in our workforce, but it wasn't a significant piece of issue for us. Well, we've mentioned in the past that we felt the inflationary pressures that we're incurring on our cost structure are being received reasonably well by the payer community. And that has, in fact, happened. We closed some additional contracts in the third quarter of this year, and they were generally in the target of where we had indicated previously that we expected our new contracts to land, and that was somewhere in the mid-single-digits. So, we are making progress with respect to our renegotiations. As I mentioned, we were already partially negotiated for 2023, and we continue to add to that negotiation in contract completion rate as we move through the third quarter. So, we're encouraged by the renegotiations that have occurred, and we are about 70% contracted for 2023 and about 45% contracted for 2024, and we're seeing elevated escalators by comparison to our historical trends on our commercial contract book. As it relates to our competitors, there's always pockets of negotiations where there's terminations and so forth. We have not had to terminate any contracts in any significant fashion. We've been able to reach agreements that work for us and work for the payers, and we'll continue to hopefully be able to make that happen. We are working with the payers with respect to making sure that our accounts receivables are handled timely and appropriately with respect to denials and so forth, and we are incorporating that into our discussions in a way that we think will be productive for us and hopefully productive for the payers. Well, I think the most material difference, and I mentioned this on the last earnings call we had is that the Affordable Care Act and the exchange community provides a potential safety net that heretofore in previous recessionary cycles we didn't have. And that, for us, we believe, is a positive. As it relates to the other aspects of our business, our demand for healthcare services tends to lag the rest of the economy and we tend to see demand in the earlier part of a recessionary cycle sort of hold, and that was when people were under COBRA benefits and so forth and then it would fade over time. But with the Affordable Care Act and the support that the exchanges provide, we're not sure how to gauge that at this particular juncture, because it's a new dynamic, but we believe it to be a favorable dynamic. So, that would be where we are at this particular point with judging the future impact of a recessionary cycle. I think, our teams are working to with our resiliency agenda and other efforts to anticipate where they can anticipate and make adjustments where they can to put us in the best position to be successful. We think our balance sheet is strong and that should create opportunities for us to invest in certain situations and hopefully gain market share. You look at our markets as a whole, Florida, Texas, Nashville, Vegas. These are fairly strong durable economies, we believe. It may be a little stronger than the nation as a whole. So, that can hopefully add some support as we go into a recessionary cycle potentially in the future. Let me make a couple of comments. I do think there is an imbalance between supply of healthcare and demand for healthcare right now, primarily because of some of the labor constraints. And people are being pushed out, they're being held up. Again, transfers are not happening as we had anticipated. So, there is some influence to that. Anecdotally, we've heard from some of our physicians that their clinic practices are starting to recover in ways that maybe earlier in the year, they didn't recover. So that's encouraging to us at some level. Obviously, during the comparison of 2019 to today, our total joint business migrated fairly significantly to outpatient activity. When you look at 2019, on the outpatient side against the third quarter of 2022, we think our outpatient activity has grown 5% or 6% over that time period. Our inpatient activity is down a little bit, most of which is explained by the total joint movement. So, we were asking ourselves when you think about it, did that business go away or not. So, I think when you look at our non-COVID admission activity, which year-to-date has grown 3% and grown a little bit more even in the commercial business, it is actually sequentially growing third quarter to second quarter. That gives us encouragement that we're moving closer to the historical trend. Again, we have a little bit of COVID influence this year because we had activity in the first quarter and a little bit of activity this quarter. But, when we look at non-COVID by itself, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. ER visits have rebounded and shown a great deal of resiliency. So, we think it's migrating closer to the historical trend than not. Yes, there are always some elements of it. I think that more pronounced one that we've seen in a long time. I think one thing. This is Sam. That's important to understand. Our length of stay is up over 2019. But our case mix is up even more. So, when you look at our length of stay on a case mix adjusted basis, it's actually down. So, that's encouraging. Now, we have opportunities. We have significant opportunities, we believe, with better case management protocols, better use of technology, better partnerships with subacute providers and our own providers in that space to really improve the throughput in our facility. Just this past week, actually, we had an update on our case management agenda, and we continue to be encouraged by the progress incrementally that they're making. And we think as we move on into 2023, that will continue. That is a key part of our capacity management and labor management as well. So, it's got a lot of efficiencies connected to it. But, we have significantly increased our case mix over 2019, and that's influenced our length of stay somewhat as well. But, I believe our overall program, which is a key ingredient to our resiliency effort is, in fact, adding value and will continue to add value for our patients as well as for the efficiency and the throughput within our facilities. Well, we will still have some capacity constraints in the fourth quarter. I'm hopeful that we will relieve some of it with our recruitment agenda and the fact that we're adding more headcount and opening beds. I think also, as I just mentioned, our case management efforts will create capacity for us as well. So -- but I do anticipate us having some closures here and there with respect to being able to take new patients at certain times. It just unfortunately happened at this at this particular point. And it happened pre-pandemic, but on a much lower level than it is today. As it relates to the ER, we've been impressed by how resilient our emergency room services are. We continue to work on our operations and our throughput within our emergency rooms so we can take care of people as they deserve to be taken care of. We've added capacity with our overall platform of emergency room offerings inside of our hospitals as well as some of our freestanding facilities, and that's been important to our outreach in that area. We believe fundamentally that the emergency room is a key ingredient to the healthcare system overall, and it provides a very important 24/7, 365 capability for our communities. And so, we're still investing, as I mentioned, in our emergency rooms in very selective ways in order to make sure that we have the right supply available for what we believe to be growing demand. This is Sam. I'll answer the last question. Most of our inflators are static. We do have some contracts that have corridors, if you want to call that, or dynamic components to it with respect to inflation. So, most of our 24 will be more of a static inflator that we negotiate on the front end. And so, that's how most of our contracts are structured."

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we'll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam. Let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements they are based on management's current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements, and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measure such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSamuel Hazen: Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter. The solid results were driven by good mix of volume with respect to payer mix and acuity, coupled with progress in managing our operating costs. Although overall demand for our services was not as strong as anticipated. When compared to the second quarter of last year, same facility revenue grew 4%. As indicated in our earnings release, same facility inpatient admissions declined 1.2% and adjusted admissions grew 0.5%. COVID admissions declined 18% and represented approximately 3% of total admissions, which is generally consistent with the mix in the prior year. COVID admissions dropped 70% from the first quarter. Emergency room visits on the same facilities basis grew 7.3% reflecting strong demand for the service. Volumes across most categories exceeded pre-pandemic levels, as compared to the second quarter of 2019. Many aspects of our business were positive considering the challenges we faced with the labor market and other inflationary pressures on costs. Our teams executed well as they have in the past through other difficult environments. Again, I want to thank them for their dedication and excellent work. Labor metrics improved in the quarter as compared to the first quarter. Recruitment was up, turnover was down and throughout the quarter we lowered contract labor expenses in each successive months with June down 22% as compared to April. Overall operating costs per adjusted admission improved on a sequential basis as compared to the first quarter. Because of these positive developments, we operated with more available capacity than we did in the first quarter and had solid volume growth sequentially. Additionally, we continue to expand our network offerings with new ambulatory centers and clinics. We opened three Galen nursing colleges in the quarter, and two more are scheduled to open later this year. And lastly, we increased hospital capacity with a targeted capital investments. If we look to the balance of the year, we see volumes returning to pre-pandemic seasonal trends, but we expect growth in inpatient admissions at a more modest level than previously indicated in our guidance and in line with gotten for outpatient categories. We believe our labor and resiliency plans are appropriately responsive to market dynamics and the needs of our business, and they should continue to generate improvements in our operations. So let me close with this, and as I've mentioned this in the past, HCA Healthcare has an outstanding track record of responding to our realities by adjusting our operations in an appropriate manner. That is a manner aligned with our mission to provide high quality care to our patients, while also being prudent with our financial management. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for more details on the quarter.\nWilliam Rutherford: Okay, great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional comments on the quarter. First, as Sam mentioned, we are pleased with the overall results of the quarter. Our diluted earnings per share was $4.21 in the quarter after excluding the $0.11 from the loss on sale of facilities and $0.20 from the retirement of debt. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.04 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.5%. Non-COVID. admissions were down 0.6% in the quarter, however, non-COVID managed care admissions were up $0.7% reflecting favorable payer mix. Non-COVID case mix was up slightly from the prior year, maintaining acuity gains we've made and overall our same facility impatient revenue per admission increased 3.3% from the second quarter of last year. In addition, as Sam mentioned, we saw improvement in most all key operating indicators compared to the first quarter, including our labor, supply, and other operating costs on both an adjusted admission and an adjusted patient day basis. We remain focused on our resiliency programs that have highlighted in last quarter\u2019s call, including our staffing and capacity efforts, executing our next generation of shared services and identifying best practices across HCA healthcare through the advancement of our benchmarking and analytic processes. These efforts continue to be an important focus for us as we respond to the current operating environment and we are pleased with the progress in these areas. So let me transition to discuss some cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our cash flow from operations was $1.63 billion in the quarter. Capital spending was $1.08 billion as compared to $842 million in the prior year period, and we completed just under $2.7 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was just above the low end of our stated leverage range. And we had just over $2.7 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Lastly, I will mention that our full-year 2022 guidance remains unchanged from what we highlighted last quarter. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank, and we'll open it up for Q&A.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so that we might give as many as possible of a chance to ask a question. Chantel [ph], you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody, congratulations on managing very well through a tough environment. I just want to maybe near term and [Technical Difficulty]. It does seem to be some confusion out there about what's happening with volumes. And I know you guys mentioned inpatient, you're a little more cautious about the back half, it doesn't sound like much. But [Technical Difficulty] it's about the same. Are we sort of in your mind as a new normal? There's some speculation about how the incident of COVID positivity may be affecting people who was a doctor. Are you seeing any of that have come down effects on your business? I guess, do you sense that there's still a fair amount of deferral out there that needs to be worked with system? Any comments on that? And then more broadly on the coming out of all of this. I know the company said from time-to-time, because you don't see anything that changes your view that you can grow mid single digits EBITDA long-term with often being towards the high end of 4% to 6% target. And I wonder if that's still your thinking?\nSamuel Hazen: A.J., thank you. This is Sam. I believe when it comes to healthcare demand, our overarching belief is that it's pretty durable, and in somewhat responsive to normal trends over time. Obviously, we're still trying to sort out the implications of COVID in the pandemic, on overall demand and make some judgments. Here again, it's only been really five months since the last surge, when you consider February, March and then through the second quarter. And so we're making some early judgments that we believe there will be normal seasonality trends with respect to how volumes behave over the balance of the year. As it relates to long-term intermediate term demand. Again, we're not seeing anything structural, that would suggest that overall demand is reduced or necessarily increase beyond what its normal trends were. And we think on the inpatient side, healthcare demand, at least in our markets is somewhere between 1% and 2% and a little bit more than that on the outpatient side. So that lines up with our pre-pandemic, but sort of thoughts around overall demand. So that's how we're seeing it. Again, we've seen incredible resiliency in our emergency room, which we were thinking that maybe it disrupted, our emergency room activities actually up. Over 2019, many categories of our business, as I mentioned on the call compared to 2019, have shown a nice, stable response. So we're still trying to sort out a few things with the pandemic and don't necessarily have great insights yet around some of those. But we do feel confident that healthcare demand in general will revert back to normal patterns as we move through the next few years.\nA.J. Rice: All right. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Also going on the labor question, sort of a two-part question. The first one is, I think about your contract labor rates, how much visibility that have and what the rates you paying in the third quarter and views as it goes in the fourth quarter. And can sort of quantify to what contract labor you paid in 2Q, when you assume within guidance and then in 3Q? And then on the full time labor, can you guys gives any color on sort of what is your average hourly nursing wages in first quarter and how that went sort of in the second quarter? Are we seeing a downtick as you guys bring on a new nurse\u2019s school? Thanks so much.\nWilliam Rutherford: Yes, Pito, this is Bill. Let me start first with the contract labor. I think, as we discussed last quarter, it was at a peak high in the first quarter really due to the COVID services. And we anticipated to be able to see sequential improvement. And indeed, that's what we saw. We thought it would first start with being able to modify the rates that we were seeing in the market in terms of the average hourly rate, and indeed, we saw that and we were able to execute on that as the quarter went through. We finished with June. We were anticipating when we reset our guidance after the first quarter. And I think over the course of the year, we'll continue to see hopefully reduction in the utilization of that contract labor. And again, we were encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw, we're encouraged by kind of how we ended the quarter in the month of June. So that's pretty much in line with what we anticipated.\nSamuel Hazen: Yes, I think the -- and Pito, this is Sam. The contract labor rate itself, we do believe there's still some room to go. When we look at where we ended the quarter, I don't have a specific number that I think it makes sense to give you at this point. But we do anticipate some continued improvement on the rate and as Bill mentioned the equalization. As it relates to our nurses and our full-time nurses, we last year about this time, did a fairly sizable market adjustment across the organization. And since then, we've continued to do very targeted adjustments for our nurses as well as our non-nurses, because we need lab techs, radiology techs, and other people to support the care delivery process. Again, we are making another market adjustment this year. I will tell you that our nurse wage increase is in the mid-single-digit. It's manageable for us we believe. We've been able to maintain productivity levels in certain instances. And we've been able to arbitrage, if you will, the very expensive contract labor. And that's allowed us to position our workforce better in the second quarter than we did in the previous three quarters. So we continue to believe that there is opportunity on that front. We see the market for labor moderating some and normalizing our turnover, as I mentioned, is down over 20% in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter are hiring in a recruitment function, which has done a wonderful job is up 18% in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter. So these metrics, early successes, if you will, give us some confidence that the combination of our compensation strategies, our retention strategy, and then the mix of our labor and workforce should improve as we move through the balance of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, good morning. I know it might be early, but how do you think we should think about key inflationary pressures for 2023 versus several trends, especially with age applies? And on the managed care side, I know that you will eventually be able to pass some of these inflationary pressures through pricing. Can you just give us some timing on how we should think about that? Thanks.\nSamuel Hazen: This is Sam, let me speak to inflation. Generally, obviously, we are seeing inflation as we mentioned inside of our labor costs. Again, I just give you an overview of how we think we're managing our way through that. And Bill can speak to some of the specifics on the supply side. Fortunately, in many areas, we have contracts that have terms to them today. So it gives us some protection in the short run. We think protection allows us to reposition some of our pricing as we move through the next few years to reflect more accurately the inflationary pressures that we're seeing and others are seeing in the provider system. We're seeing some early success and recognition by the payers. And we expect the payers to appreciate the overall inflationary environment that the providers are in, but we're seeing some early recognition of that and some renegotiated contract have reflected more escalation in pricing than what we had seen in our past trends. As I mentioned on the last call, we're pretty much contracted for 2022, obviously, but as we look to 2023, we'll start to see some uplift in our contract pricing, reflecting the new contracts. And then on '24, we fully anticipate having a different trend on our pricing as a result of these renegotiations. On our capital costs, we obviously experienced some inflationary pressures there. I don't know that we have visibility at this point to give you any number on any of those we think about 2023. So we'll try to hone in on that a little bit more as we get ready for our guidance in the next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with SVB Securities. Your line is open.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Bill, the AR days jumped up again this quarter. I'm just trying to understand like what's driving that is that higher payer claim edits, is there any underlying deterioration in collection rates, just anything to put that into context? And if you could sort of describe how that track relative to your expectations, and if I could also just get the -- I don't know if I got the call for FTE number in the quarter. Maybe you shared it, but I missed it. But that'd be helpful. Thanks.\nWilliam Rutherford: Yes, Whit. We have seen some increase in AR days as we've gone through the year. Part of that is prior period during COVID, I think the payers have kind of turned off many of their bill edits, we've seen some of those come back into play. Pretty much in line with what we anticipated, we're hoping the kind of at a high mark right now, we'll continue to see improvement as we go through the year. But we are seeing a little bit more kind of delays in the payment processing cycle. And we're working through that with our payers. In terms of the cost per FTE, we saw again sequential improvement in the quarter compared to the first quarter recall in the first quarter, we ran pretty high. I think it was almost a 7% year-over-year number, more now in the 4.5% for the second quarter. And so it was tracking about what we anticipated as we ended the first quarter.\nWhit Mayo: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with -- I'm sorry Whit Mayo.\nSamuel Hazen: Gary Taylor.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Hi, can you hear me?\nSamuel Hazen: Yes.\nGary Taylor: Okay. Just the two parter, both of which you've just touched on a little bit, I just wanted to make sure I understood if you'd provide a little more color. I think we sort of triangulated in the first quarter, somewhere north of $600 million of contract labor spend. And I know that's down and you said it was down you said was in June, but just wondering kind of where that ran for the quarter, just to help us sort of modeling the rest of the year. And then the second parter is with the AR growth and also payables down, you've done $3 billion cash from Ops in the first half in the annual guide is 9% to 9.5%. So, despite the payer edits and so forth, you still feel good about the cash from Ops number for the year?\nWilliam Rutherford: Yes, Gary let me start with the cash flow process, it's Bill. We're continuing to look at that, I think it's probably going to be hovering around the 8%, maybe 8.5% level somewhere in between those. And we'll continue to track that as the year goes on. But I still think that's a very strong number for us and allows us to kind of execute on all aspects of our capital allocation philosophy. When you look at the contract labor piece, we did see sequential improvement, the actual dollars amount were down from where we were in the first quarter, and we're looking at contract labor as a percent of SWB, we finished at the end of the quarter of the month of June, down just above 8% where in the first quarter, we were running 9%, 9.2%. So again, we saw I think nice improvement in the absolute contract labor numbers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoanna Gajuk: Good morning, actually, this is Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today, so thanks for taking the question here. So I guess the first question and then I have a follow-up too but in terms of looking at I know you maybe it's early to talk about next year, but you obviously kept your guidance positive, given the expectation here. This year has some benefits right from sequestration PHE being extended. So how should we think about, roughly speaking from going from here, is this year a good base to grow off of your long-term kind of targeted growth rate? And my follow-up question in terms of the commercial pricing discussion that you highlighted in terms of the improvement over time. So is it fair to assume when you look at the history, right of the company, should we expecting commercial that would be accelerated to say, 4%, 5% at some point, like we saw in the past, we're in a period of high cost inflation. Thank you.\nWilliam Rutherford: Well, let me make sure I got that, relative to 2023, and kind of the plusses and minuses as we go through the year. Yes, we are anticipating as we go through the balance of this year, kind of the normal course of business has stabilized, as Sam mentioned in his comments, we think we're going to see patterns return to kind of their normal seasonal trend. And so that should give us a good base to grow off of in 2023. It's a little early to be talking about all the variables in 2023. We're going to be approaching our planning process right now. But most of them are no. And I think, as Sam mentioned in his earlier comments, we think fundamentally, there continues to be growing demand for healthcare in our markets. And we're well positioned to serve that. And I think that becomes a nice place to think about 2023 in as we go forward. Relative to commercial pricing, as he said and as we mentioned before, we are having those discussion with the payers, we've had some early success, there's a recognition of the inflationary pressures that providers are seeing. So we'll continue to progress those discussions as we go forward. And hopefully we'll continue to roll those and get to benefit in '23.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on a couple of numbers questions. First, on COVID, I know you had expected the PHE earlier to expire, like almost in the first half. I think your number was about $150 million of that. Can you give us an updated number there in terms of what's in guidance, then on that total pricing, I know it's early, and you've got some wins there, hopefully. But can you give us an idea of pricing, I think was in a 4% to 5% range historically. Where do you think those contracts shakeout in terms of, as we do get through them, they may shake up the high single-digits or something a little bit lower than that. And that's it for me.\nSamuel Hazen: Yes, Justin let me start with your first one relative to the various COVID support. Honestly, very little did we recognized in the first quarter, probably $20 million to $25 million. You look at last year, you guys probably hovering around $140 million in a quarter, pretty much in line with what our expectations were most of those programs have pretty much concluded. And so we'll run this out. I think it's probably $200 million year-to-date. So that's pretty close to what we anticipated, when we turn the calendar and expectations relative to pricing. I think it's reasonable to assume that we were in 3.5% to 4% zone previously with our commercial pricing, that we are going to be in the mid-single-digits as it relates to our expectations, how all those land, we don't know yet, we believe again with transparency in such that we're in a competitive positioning as a company globally. And that allows us to negotiate based upon the inflationary pressures, reasonable escalator as I mentioned. So that's sort of our targets. We're still early as our contracts come up for renewal. And we need to understand where the payers think we are aware they are in their planning as well. And I believe our relationships will allow us to get to a number that makes sense for both organizations. But I do anticipate it being somewhere around the mid-single-digits.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBen Hendrix: Hey, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a capital deployment question now ex-these Utah hospital acquisitions, given the FTC challenge, does this change at all your strategy or impede the strategy of accessing patient access points in market? Could this potentially mean that we might look at some larger health system acquisitions in new markets. So just any thoughts on that? Thanks.\nSamuel Hazen: I don't think the decision in Utah necessarily changes our overall outlook, we will continue to look for opportunities that are appropriate in market, most of us tend to be ambulatory oriented, where we're able to add to our networks, just this past quarter, we acquired another urgent care company in our Virginia division. And it's solidified our network capabilities offerings in that particular state, just like we've done previously in Florida. So we'll continue to look for outpatient network development opportunities. A lot of that will be our own Greenfield projects, but it may be some acquisition opportunities here and there. As it relates to markets, clearly, we're interested in new markets, we think we have the organizational capability and the financial capability to create a lot of value in the communities across the country. And hopefully, we will see some opportunities on that front, we're fortunate to be in a position where we have solid organic growth opportunities, given the markets that we serve. And so we will continue to invest in those. I think in general, our capital allocation strategies will remain consistent. We have a very diversified approach to capital allocation. And we all continue to use that model for delivering shareholder value as well as making sure our networks are sufficiently developed with capacity in different offerings.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Sam, you mentioned in your prepared remarks how you opened three new Galen nursing schools this past quarter. So there's a lot of chatter about how difficult it is to add nursing school capacity here in the U.S. Just curious in terms of how you're thinking about the ability to add more locations, based on availability of professors and licenses to add to the nursing capacity in HCA?\nSamuel Hazen: Thank you. I think the acquisition of Galen has yielded since we closed on that transaction, we've added eight new schools. And in most circumstances, those schools have started with a moment that was ahead of our model. Part of our ability to expand and open new colleges as efficiently and effectively, as Galen has far is really reflective of a unique model they have where they standardize the facility. They standardize the curriculum in the delivery, what's unique about HCA and Galen together is that we can use some of our own staff to support faculty needs in some cases, and then obviously create very efficient and effective clinical rotations. We are up to 13 schools. We will open like I said a couple more this year, and I think our pipeline has six to eight over the following 12 to 18 months. Our vision is that all of our major communities will have at least one Galen College of Nursing as part of the overall network offering, some communities because of their size will probably have more than one. So we're extremely encouraged. I have visited myself three of our new schools. There's tremendous enthusiasm with the students. There's tremendous enthusiasm with the faculty and their tremendous enthusiasm with our nursing leadership across the company about the unique possibilities, that the integration of nursing education with clinical operations in facilities as sort of an integrated model is something that is differentiated and it's going to create better nurses, better value for the patient, and we think it supply for HCA facilities that you need in most circumstances.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Raskin: Thanks, good morning. Are there certain parts of the healthcare delivery ecosystem that you think are more attractive now that you're talking about the sort of new stabilization, that that just haven't been as attractive in the past. Are there areas of growth for HCA in the future that you just haven't looked at in the past?\nSamuel Hazen: I don't think there's anything that's completely changed. Obviously, outpatient facilities, pre-pandemic were very important aspects to our network. We have roughly 2,500 outpatient facilities that are part of our hospital network ecosystem. So it's about what 12:1 in our company. We were very intentional over the last decade in building out our outpatient network to support our hospitals, which is sort of the core of who we are. And that integrated network model, we think was very effective, and very supportive and our ability to go from 23% market share in 2011 to 28% market share today. As we push forward into the future, I do anticipate more velocity, if you will, and the network development we've had previously. But that really is across all aspects of outpatient development. Our philosophy is to create convenience for the patient, efficiency for the patient with different price points, and then integration with a full system approach, so that the patient can get whatever services they need inside of our overall provider system. I don't know that anything is uniquely differentiated in that though, and I think it takes a comprehensive and complementary approach to be most effective and most responsive to our patients and our physicians.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, thanks a lot. Just wanted to understand a little bit about kind of volume constraints that have been in place during COVID. And including labor supply constraints, and maybe how you track those metrics to see if those are starting to kind of loosen up a little bit, that the aiding volume in addition to just normal resumption of volume trends out there. So how are you looking at it? And what are some of the steps you're taking to kind of improve labor supply there?\nSamuel Hazen: Well, let me speak to our occupancy. This is Sam again, we ran about 72% occupancy in the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we did open up more capacity than we had in the first quarter, we were a bit constrained with staffing. We had surgeons we were dealing with. So our overall availability of capacity was not as much as it was in the second quarter. In the second quarter, however, we did have periods of time, where our staffing constrained our capacity, and we weren't able to take transfers and through our transfer centers, which are a very important element of our network that I just talked about, with our network model. And we saw situations where we couldn't take patients in certain facilities at certain times. It wasn't structural, but it was episodic in how much activity we had at a particular facility at a particular point in time, as well as the staffing. Our overall staffing supply agenda, I've spoken to that already around recruitment, retention, different care models that we're trying to use and managing our case management capabilities at a totally different level. We've seen improve every one of those categories, and that's helped us stretch our capacity, if you will, in appropriate ways that deliver outcomes for patients that are appropriate. So we'll continue to move on all of those initiatives. And we think it will allow us over time to continue to open up more and more capacity. We've seen a lot pressure in our behavioral health services, where we have a reasonable number of facilities that are operating less than at full capacity, we've had the same thing in our rehab services. And we had the same thing in other aspects of our business. But again, it's improved sequentially. And we think it will continue to improve as we move through the year. Does that significantly compromise our volume? No. But it does create some opportunities for more volume as we manage through those initiatives.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. I was interested if you can give us your perspectives on the evolving primary care environment, just with all the focus on value based care and then and with the emergence of some new players in the space, I guess, including yesterday. And then for HCA, how you think that could impact physician recruitment or network development longer term? Thanks.\nSamuel Hazen: Thank you. This is an interesting point in healthcare, generally speaking, I mean, primary care is a multi-faceted offering. It has urgent care, it has women services, pediatric services, telemedicine, internal medicine, even the emergency room, in some cases serves as a primary care platform for many people. So our approach is to have as many components of the primary care offering set as we possibly can. In some cases that's employed, we have employed physicians. In our physician model, we have our urgent care offerings, we have telemedicine offerings. We have pediatric offerings, and so forth. In many instances as a combination of employee and affiliate physicians or affiliate providers, it could be providers of other urgent care centers, or other physicians and so forth. What's developed with the one medical, it being just another component of a possible affiliated network offering, I don't know that it completely changes the paradigm that exists across the multi-faceted aspects of primary care and how people access care through those different dimensions. So we will continue to have a pluralistic approach to primary care. And we think that's the model that works for us, as pushed through our system approach to healthcare in these communities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Mason with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJohn Mason: Hey, good morning. Bill, you said on the first quarter, you thought the kind of short term margin was in the 19% to 20% range with the new realities. As your thinking changed on that?\nWilliam Rutherford: No, John, not really. I mean, you look we did I think we did it 19.7 in the first and 20.5 in the second. Obviously, there's pluses and minuses. As you know, there's a lot of variables that go into the actual margin number, and we continue to focus to operate the company as efficiently as possible. But I think that 19 to 20 range is a good planning horizon for us. I think there'll be periods were north of that some periods where within that. So I still think that thinking holds today.\nJohn Mason: Thank you.\nWilliam Rutherford: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. The commentary you gave on the non-COVID emission metrics, seems like you're seeing the growth in managed care, but I guess that implies, declines on the government side of the business or the uninsured side of business. I was hoping you could provide some insight into, what you think is driving that differential? And then as a follow-up, just wondering how we should be thinking about the growth of surgical volumes for the balance of the year? Thank you.\nWilliam Rutherford: Well, this is Bill, let me start with a non-COVID piece. I think there's a couple of things that play there. One, we did see growth in the non-COVID managed care. And that continued, I think a favorable payer mix during that we were seeing and again, as I said in my remarks, we also saw the acuity levels maintain. So those are two areas that we're focused for us and we were pleased with that. Relative to the governmental activity in a non-COVID. It fluctuates, we are seeing some growth in the Medicare, which is still a good thing for us. Our total Medicare admissions, I think we're at 0.6% for the quarter, but we also saw growth in the managed care side. So I think, ultimately what we expect to see is a return to historical growth patterns and pretty consistent among those payer prices. And as I've talked about in various settings, it may be a return of both governmental payer classes as well as a commercial and net-net those are still positive and productive for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Mok with UBS. Your line is open.\nAndrew Mok: Hi, good morning, given the footprint of your hospitals, it seems like you are well positioned to benefit from stronger ACA enrollment helped by enhanced premium tax credits, can you help size the benefit in terms of revenue or volumes from those programs? And how are you thinking about the impact to your business should those enhanced subsidies expire? Thanks.\nSamuel Hazen: Yes, that's a great question. And I'm sure paying attention to that. And we have some hope that we'll see those enhanced subsidies have some continuation, and we'll pay attention to that as the year goes on. And we'll try to assess any impact of that in 2023. There's no doubt we talked about that through 2021, we saw growth in the health insurance exchange activity across HCA primarily due to the enrollment increases that we saw on there. So if the subsidies end up being reduced, it would have impact on enrollment, it could have an impact on our volume, we haven't fully sized all of that, we're going to wait to see how the various proposals worked through Congress and the Houses and again, helped get some extension on there. But if we go into '23, that's obviously a key area that we're going to have to focus on kind of soon. But we saw I think, through the course of '21, our health insurance exchange growth, probably 20% to 25% in a given period. And again, I do think that was primarily attributable to the increased enrollment that I think is attributable to the enhanced subsidy. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. We're hopeful that they find ways to continue those and you won't see a drop of people gaining coverage through the health insurance changes we go through the balance of the year.\nAndrew Mok: Great, thank you.\nSamuel Hazen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citi. Your line is open.\nJason Cassorla: Great, thanks. Good morning, just with year-to-date CapEx spending close to $2 billion, you're seemingly tracking towards your '22 guidance of $4.2 billion. But I was wondering if your expectations on areas for CapEx allocation for service lines specifically has changed given trends so far, perhaps different service line buildouts, just given the volume and labor backdrop, any help there would be great, thanks.\nSamuel Hazen: This is Sam, I don't think we're going to see any material change in how we allocate capital. We believe we have a sufficient allocation around our technology agenda, our outpatient development agenda, and then as I mentioned in my comments, targeted hospital investments to support a growth opportunity or relieve a capacity constraint or really even create a better environment for our patients in some instances. So I don't anticipate significant shifting of categories, we will obviously adjust the overall market demand picture in such from one community to the other and we'll weave into that inside of those categories primarily.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sarah James with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSarah James: Hey, thank you. So if I think about the 10,000 nursing students a year that could be graduating from Galen, how much of those are actually taking full-time positions at HCA? What's your capture rate and then is there anything that you can be doing with tuition reimbursement to try to improve your capture rates?\nSamuel Hazen: Well, that's a great question. We're evolving our integration model, as I mentioned with nurse students and externs and rotations and so forth, and it's a little early to give an indication as to what the capture rate will be, if you will, partly due to the fact that the schools are new, and we aren't seeing graduates just yet. We only have two schools today in HCA markets where they're graduating students. And we're improving sequentially our capture rates, use your term in those two schools, and that's in Tampa and San Antonio, where we're seeing more Galen students land in HCA facilities. We have a very robust academic partnership strategy. It's not just Galen, Galen can't solve all of the nursing needs for the organization. They can complement it in a very significant way, as we've mentioned, but our broader academic partnership agenda is working with other great schools out there that provide nursing care. And we think what we can do is learn from our Galen experience and meet with other academic centers more effectively create a better experience for their students, and maybe a better pathway forward into HCA facilities in the future. We do have numerous programs that support HCA colleagues in getting nursing degrees. We have tuition support, we have other programs that create opportunities for our people inside of Galen, and we're continuing to evolve those. But I'm encouraged by some of the early indications of how many HCA colleagues were actually participating in Galen schools now. So we will hopefully see some benefit from that in the future.\nSarah James: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJamie Perse: Hey, good morning. You commented earlier just on your ability to flex and adapt. And you showed that this quarter and really the last couple of years, I'm curious how you think about a recessionary scenario or just lower growth overall, constrained consumers, weaker job growth. How should we be thinking about that type of environment? And what types of things that are in your playbook to adapt to a more challenging macro?\nSamuel Hazen: Well, we have gone through numerous recessionary cycles, just as other companies have gone through. And we're preparing ourselves for what that could be, if it does develop in this cycle. And Bill alluded to a number of the programs that we have, trying to make sure our efficiencies and other resiliency items are pushing forward regardless of the circumstance because we see value there and opportunities. I think what is potentially different in a very significant and structural way now is how the Affordable Care Act in exchanges and Medicaid expansion play in a recessionary cycle, we have never had that safety net during that type of cycle. In those past cycles, if a person was lost their job, they went into an uninsured ranks. I think what we have today is a unique safety net for those people in the Affordable Care Act programs that should provide some support by comparison to past cycles. Typically, we lag as many of you know, and how demand behaves in a recessionary cycle, but it provides labor relief also for us. So there's a balance between the two, HCA Healthcare has performed well in past recessionary cycles. And I'm confident that we can perform reasonably well in future recessionary cycles as we get more adaptability in our business and then again, as the Affordable Care Act provides some level of support that we hadn't seen in the past.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Frank Morgan for closing remarks.\nFrank Morgan: Chantel, thank you for your help today. And thanks everyone for joining our call, who gave a wonderful weekend. I'll be around today if I can answer any additional questions you might have. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "William Rutherford",
            "content": "Okay, great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional comments on the quarter. First, as Sam mentioned, we are pleased with the overall results of the quarter. Our diluted earnings per share was $4.21 in the quarter after excluding the $0.11 from the loss on sale of facilities and $0.20 from the retirement of debt. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.04 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.5%. Non-COVID. admissions were down 0.6% in the quarter, however, non-COVID managed care admissions were up $0.7% reflecting favorable payer mix. Non-COVID case mix was up slightly from the prior year, maintaining acuity gains we've made and overall our same facility impatient revenue per admission increased 3.3% from the second quarter of last year. In addition, as Sam mentioned, we saw improvement in most all key operating indicators compared to the first quarter, including our labor, supply, and other operating costs on both an adjusted admission and an adjusted patient day basis. We remain focused on our resiliency programs that have highlighted in last quarter's call, including our staffing and capacity efforts, executing our next generation of shared services and identifying best practices across HCA healthcare through the advancement of our benchmarking and analytic processes. These efforts continue to be an important focus for us as we respond to the current operating environment and we are pleased with the progress in these areas. So let me transition to discuss some cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our cash flow from operations was $1.63 billion in the quarter. Capital spending was $1.08 billion as compared to $842 million in the prior year period, and we completed just under $2.7 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was just above the low end of our stated leverage range. And we had just over $2.7 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Lastly, I will mention that our full-year 2022 guidance remains unchanged from what we highlighted last quarter. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank, and we'll open it up for Q&A. Yes, Pito, this is Bill. Let me start first with the contract labor. I think, as we discussed last quarter, it was at a peak high in the first quarter really due to the COVID services. And we anticipated to be able to see sequential improvement. And indeed, that's what we saw. We thought it would first start with being able to modify the rates that we were seeing in the market in terms of the average hourly rate, and indeed, we saw that and we were able to execute on that as the quarter went through. We finished with June. We were anticipating when we reset our guidance after the first quarter. And I think over the course of the year, we'll continue to see hopefully reduction in the utilization of that contract labor. And again, we were encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw, we're encouraged by kind of how we ended the quarter in the month of June. So that's pretty much in line with what we anticipated. Yes, Whit. We have seen some increase in AR days as we've gone through the year. Part of that is prior period during COVID, I think the payers have kind of turned off many of their bill edits, we've seen some of those come back into play. Pretty much in line with what we anticipated, we're hoping the kind of at a high mark right now, we'll continue to see improvement as we go through the year. But we are seeing a little bit more kind of delays in the payment processing cycle. And we're working through that with our payers. In terms of the cost per FTE, we saw again sequential improvement in the quarter compared to the first quarter recall in the first quarter, we ran pretty high. I think it was almost a 7% year-over-year number, more now in the 4.5% for the second quarter. And so it was tracking about what we anticipated as we ended the first quarter. Yes, Gary let me start with the cash flow process, it's Bill. We're continuing to look at that, I think it's probably going to be hovering around the 8%, maybe 8.5% level somewhere in between those. And we'll continue to track that as the year goes on. But I still think that's a very strong number for us and allows us to kind of execute on all aspects of our capital allocation philosophy. When you look at the contract labor piece, we did see sequential improvement, the actual dollars amount were down from where we were in the first quarter, and we're looking at contract labor as a percent of SWB, we finished at the end of the quarter of the month of June, down just above 8% where in the first quarter, we were running 9%, 9.2%. So again, we saw I think nice improvement in the absolute contract labor numbers. Well, let me make sure I got that, relative to 2023, and kind of the plusses and minuses as we go through the year. Yes, we are anticipating as we go through the balance of this year, kind of the normal course of business has stabilized, as Sam mentioned in his comments, we think we're going to see patterns return to kind of their normal seasonal trend. And so that should give us a good base to grow off of in 2023. It's a little early to be talking about all the variables in 2023. We're going to be approaching our planning process right now. But most of them are no. And I think, as Sam mentioned in his earlier comments, we think fundamentally, there continues to be growing demand for healthcare in our markets. And we're well positioned to serve that. And I think that becomes a nice place to think about 2023 in as we go forward. Relative to commercial pricing, as he said and as we mentioned before, we are having those discussion with the payers, we've had some early success, there's a recognition of the inflationary pressures that providers are seeing. So we'll continue to progress those discussions as we go forward. And hopefully we'll continue to roll those and get to benefit in '23. No, John, not really. I mean, you look we did I think we did it 19.7 in the first and 20.5 in the second. Obviously, there's pluses and minuses. As you know, there's a lot of variables that go into the actual margin number, and we continue to focus to operate the company as efficiently as possible. But I think that 19 to 20 range is a good planning horizon for us. I think there'll be periods were north of that some periods where within that. So I still think that thinking holds today. Yes. Well, this is Bill, let me start with a non-COVID piece. I think there's a couple of things that play there. One, we did see growth in the non-COVID managed care. And that continued, I think a favorable payer mix during that we were seeing and again, as I said in my remarks, we also saw the acuity levels maintain. So those are two areas that we're focused for us and we were pleased with that. Relative to the governmental activity in a non-COVID. It fluctuates, we are seeing some growth in the Medicare, which is still a good thing for us. Our total Medicare admissions, I think we're at 0.6% for the quarter, but we also saw growth in the managed care side. So I think, ultimately what we expect to see is a return to historical growth patterns and pretty consistent among those payer prices. And as I've talked about in various settings, it may be a return of both governmental payer classes as well as a commercial and net-net those are still positive and productive for us."

            "name": "Samuel Hazen",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter. The solid results were driven by good mix of volume with respect to payer mix and acuity, coupled with progress in managing our operating costs. Although overall demand for our services was not as strong as anticipated. When compared to the second quarter of last year, same facility revenue grew 4%. As indicated in our earnings release, same facility inpatient admissions declined 1.2% and adjusted admissions grew 0.5%. COVID admissions declined 18% and represented approximately 3% of total admissions, which is generally consistent with the mix in the prior year. COVID admissions dropped 70% from the first quarter. Emergency room visits on the same facilities basis grew 7.3% reflecting strong demand for the service. Volumes across most categories exceeded pre-pandemic levels, as compared to the second quarter of 2019. Many aspects of our business were positive considering the challenges we faced with the labor market and other inflationary pressures on costs. Our teams executed well as they have in the past through other difficult environments. Again, I want to thank them for their dedication and excellent work. Labor metrics improved in the quarter as compared to the first quarter. Recruitment was up, turnover was down and throughout the quarter we lowered contract labor expenses in each successive months with June down 22% as compared to April. Overall operating costs per adjusted admission improved on a sequential basis as compared to the first quarter. Because of these positive developments, we operated with more available capacity than we did in the first quarter and had solid volume growth sequentially. Additionally, we continue to expand our network offerings with new ambulatory centers and clinics. We opened three Galen nursing colleges in the quarter, and two more are scheduled to open later this year. And lastly, we increased hospital capacity with a targeted capital investments. If we look to the balance of the year, we see volumes returning to pre-pandemic seasonal trends, but we expect growth in inpatient admissions at a more modest level than previously indicated in our guidance and in line with gotten for outpatient categories. We believe our labor and resiliency plans are appropriately responsive to market dynamics and the needs of our business, and they should continue to generate improvements in our operations. So let me close with this, and as I've mentioned this in the past, HCA Healthcare has an outstanding track record of responding to our realities by adjusting our operations in an appropriate manner. That is a manner aligned with our mission to provide high quality care to our patients, while also being prudent with our financial management. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for more details on the quarter. A.J., thank you. This is Sam. I believe when it comes to healthcare demand, our overarching belief is that it's pretty durable, and in somewhat responsive to normal trends over time. Obviously, we're still trying to sort out the implications of COVID in the pandemic, on overall demand and make some judgments. Here again, it's only been really five months since the last surge, when you consider February, March and then through the second quarter. And so we're making some early judgments that we believe there will be normal seasonality trends with respect to how volumes behave over the balance of the year. As it relates to long-term intermediate term demand. Again, we're not seeing anything structural, that would suggest that overall demand is reduced or necessarily increase beyond what its normal trends were. And we think on the inpatient side, healthcare demand, at least in our markets is somewhere between 1% and 2% and a little bit more than that on the outpatient side. So that lines up with our pre-pandemic, but sort of thoughts around overall demand. So that's how we're seeing it. Again, we've seen incredible resiliency in our emergency room, which we were thinking that maybe it disrupted, our emergency room activities actually up. Over 2019, many categories of our business, as I mentioned on the call compared to 2019, have shown a nice, stable response. So we're still trying to sort out a few things with the pandemic and don't necessarily have great insights yet around some of those. But we do feel confident that healthcare demand in general will revert back to normal patterns as we move through the next few years. Yes, I think the -- and Pito, this is Sam. The contract labor rate itself, we do believe there's still some room to go. When we look at where we ended the quarter, I don't have a specific number that I think it makes sense to give you at this point. But we do anticipate some continued improvement on the rate and as Bill mentioned the equalization. As it relates to our nurses and our full-time nurses, we last year about this time, did a fairly sizable market adjustment across the organization. And since then, we've continued to do very targeted adjustments for our nurses as well as our non-nurses, because we need lab techs, radiology techs, and other people to support the care delivery process. Again, we are making another market adjustment this year. I will tell you that our nurse wage increase is in the mid-single-digit. It's manageable for us we believe. We've been able to maintain productivity levels in certain instances. And we've been able to arbitrage, if you will, the very expensive contract labor. And that's allowed us to position our workforce better in the second quarter than we did in the previous three quarters. So we continue to believe that there is opportunity on that front. We see the market for labor moderating some and normalizing our turnover, as I mentioned, is down over 20% in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter are hiring in a recruitment function, which has done a wonderful job is up 18% in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter. So these metrics, early successes, if you will, give us some confidence that the combination of our compensation strategies, our retention strategy, and then the mix of our labor and workforce should improve as we move through the balance of the year. This is Sam, let me speak to inflation. Generally, obviously, we are seeing inflation as we mentioned inside of our labor costs. Again, I just give you an overview of how we think we're managing our way through that. And Bill can speak to some of the specifics on the supply side. Fortunately, in many areas, we have contracts that have terms to them today. So it gives us some protection in the short run. We think protection allows us to reposition some of our pricing as we move through the next few years to reflect more accurately the inflationary pressures that we're seeing and others are seeing in the provider system. We're seeing some early success and recognition by the payers. And we expect the payers to appreciate the overall inflationary environment that the providers are in, but we're seeing some early recognition of that and some renegotiated contract have reflected more escalation in pricing than what we had seen in our past trends. As I mentioned on the last call, we're pretty much contracted for 2022, obviously, but as we look to 2023, we'll start to see some uplift in our contract pricing, reflecting the new contracts. And then on '24, we fully anticipate having a different trend on our pricing as a result of these renegotiations. On our capital costs, we obviously experienced some inflationary pressures there. I don't know that we have visibility at this point to give you any number on any of those we think about 2023. So we'll try to hone in on that a little bit more as we get ready for our guidance in the next year. Gary Taylor. Yes. Yes, Justin let me start with your first one relative to the various COVID support. Honestly, very little did we recognized in the first quarter, probably $20 million to $25 million. You look at last year, you guys probably hovering around $140 million in a quarter, pretty much in line with what our expectations were most of those programs have pretty much concluded. And so we'll run this out. I think it's probably $200 million year-to-date. So that's pretty close to what we anticipated, when we turn the calendar and expectations relative to pricing. I think it's reasonable to assume that we were in 3.5% to 4% zone previously with our commercial pricing, that we are going to be in the mid-single-digits as it relates to our expectations, how all those land, we don't know yet, we believe again with transparency in such that we're in a competitive positioning as a company globally. And that allows us to negotiate based upon the inflationary pressures, reasonable escalator as I mentioned. So that's sort of our targets. We're still early as our contracts come up for renewal. And we need to understand where the payers think we are aware they are in their planning as well. And I believe our relationships will allow us to get to a number that makes sense for both organizations. But I do anticipate it being somewhere around the mid-single-digits. I don't think the decision in Utah necessarily changes our overall outlook, we will continue to look for opportunities that are appropriate in market, most of us tend to be ambulatory oriented, where we're able to add to our networks, just this past quarter, we acquired another urgent care company in our Virginia division. And it's solidified our network capabilities offerings in that particular state, just like we've done previously in Florida. So we'll continue to look for outpatient network development opportunities. A lot of that will be our own Greenfield projects, but it may be some acquisition opportunities here and there. As it relates to markets, clearly, we're interested in new markets, we think we have the organizational capability and the financial capability to create a lot of value in the communities across the country. And hopefully, we will see some opportunities on that front, we're fortunate to be in a position where we have solid organic growth opportunities, given the markets that we serve. And so we will continue to invest in those. I think in general, our capital allocation strategies will remain consistent. We have a very diversified approach to capital allocation. And we all continue to use that model for delivering shareholder value as well as making sure our networks are sufficiently developed with capacity in different offerings. Thank you. I think the acquisition of Galen has yielded since we closed on that transaction, we've added eight new schools. And in most circumstances, those schools have started with a moment that was ahead of our model. Part of our ability to expand and open new colleges as efficiently and effectively, as Galen has far is really reflective of a unique model they have where they standardize the facility. They standardize the curriculum in the delivery, what's unique about HCA and Galen together is that we can use some of our own staff to support faculty needs in some cases, and then obviously create very efficient and effective clinical rotations. We are up to 13 schools. We will open like I said a couple more this year, and I think our pipeline has six to eight over the following 12 to 18 months. Our vision is that all of our major communities will have at least one Galen College of Nursing as part of the overall network offering, some communities because of their size will probably have more than one. So we're extremely encouraged. I have visited myself three of our new schools. There's tremendous enthusiasm with the students. There's tremendous enthusiasm with the faculty and their tremendous enthusiasm with our nursing leadership across the company about the unique possibilities, that the integration of nursing education with clinical operations in facilities as sort of an integrated model is something that is differentiated and it's going to create better nurses, better value for the patient, and we think it supply for HCA facilities that you need in most circumstances. I don't think there's anything that's completely changed. Obviously, outpatient facilities, pre-pandemic were very important aspects to our network. We have roughly 2,500 outpatient facilities that are part of our hospital network ecosystem. So it's about what 12:1 in our company. We were very intentional over the last decade in building out our outpatient network to support our hospitals, which is sort of the core of who we are. And that integrated network model, we think was very effective, and very supportive and our ability to go from 23% market share in 2011 to 28% market share today. As we push forward into the future, I do anticipate more velocity, if you will, and the network development we've had previously. But that really is across all aspects of outpatient development. Our philosophy is to create convenience for the patient, efficiency for the patient with different price points, and then integration with a full system approach, so that the patient can get whatever services they need inside of our overall provider system. I don't know that anything is uniquely differentiated in that though, and I think it takes a comprehensive and complementary approach to be most effective and most responsive to our patients and our physicians. Well, let me speak to our occupancy. This is Sam again, we ran about 72% occupancy in the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we did open up more capacity than we had in the first quarter, we were a bit constrained with staffing. We had surgeons we were dealing with. So our overall availability of capacity was not as much as it was in the second quarter. In the second quarter, however, we did have periods of time, where our staffing constrained our capacity, and we weren't able to take transfers and through our transfer centers, which are a very important element of our network that I just talked about, with our network model. And we saw situations where we couldn't take patients in certain facilities at certain times. It wasn't structural, but it was episodic in how much activity we had at a particular facility at a particular point in time, as well as the staffing. Our overall staffing supply agenda, I've spoken to that already around recruitment, retention, different care models that we're trying to use and managing our case management capabilities at a totally different level. We've seen improve every one of those categories, and that's helped us stretch our capacity, if you will, in appropriate ways that deliver outcomes for patients that are appropriate. So we'll continue to move on all of those initiatives. And we think it will allow us over time to continue to open up more and more capacity. We've seen a lot pressure in our behavioral health services, where we have a reasonable number of facilities that are operating less than at full capacity, we've had the same thing in our rehab services. And we had the same thing in other aspects of our business. But again, it's improved sequentially. And we think it will continue to improve as we move through the year. Does that significantly compromise our volume? No. But it does create some opportunities for more volume as we manage through those initiatives. Thank you. This is an interesting point in healthcare, generally speaking, I mean, primary care is a multi-faceted offering. It has urgent care, it has women services, pediatric services, telemedicine, internal medicine, even the emergency room, in some cases serves as a primary care platform for many people. So our approach is to have as many components of the primary care offering set as we possibly can. In some cases that's employed, we have employed physicians. In our physician model, we have our urgent care offerings, we have telemedicine offerings. We have pediatric offerings, and so forth. In many instances as a combination of employee and affiliate physicians or affiliate providers, it could be providers of other urgent care centers, or other physicians and so forth. What's developed with the one medical, it being just another component of a possible affiliated network offering, I don't know that it completely changes the paradigm that exists across the multi-faceted aspects of primary care and how people access care through those different dimensions. So we will continue to have a pluralistic approach to primary care. And we think that's the model that works for us, as pushed through our system approach to healthcare in these communities. Yes, that's a great question. And I'm sure paying attention to that. And we have some hope that we'll see those enhanced subsidies have some continuation, and we'll pay attention to that as the year goes on. And we'll try to assess any impact of that in 2023. There's no doubt we talked about that through 2021, we saw growth in the health insurance exchange activity across HCA primarily due to the enrollment increases that we saw on there. So if the subsidies end up being reduced, it would have impact on enrollment, it could have an impact on our volume, we haven't fully sized all of that, we're going to wait to see how the various proposals worked through Congress and the Houses and again, helped get some extension on there. But if we go into '23, that's obviously a key area that we're going to have to focus on kind of soon. But we saw I think, through the course of '21, our health insurance exchange growth, probably 20% to 25% in a given period. And again, I do think that was primarily attributable to the increased enrollment that I think is attributable to the enhanced subsidy. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. We're hopeful that they find ways to continue those and you won't see a drop of people gaining coverage through the health insurance changes we go through the balance of the year. Thank you. This is Sam, I don't think we're going to see any material change in how we allocate capital. We believe we have a sufficient allocation around our technology agenda, our outpatient development agenda, and then as I mentioned in my comments, targeted hospital investments to support a growth opportunity or relieve a capacity constraint or really even create a better environment for our patients in some instances. So I don't anticipate significant shifting of categories, we will obviously adjust the overall market demand picture in such from one community to the other and we'll weave into that inside of those categories primarily. Well, that's a great question. We're evolving our integration model, as I mentioned with nurse students and externs and rotations and so forth, and it's a little early to give an indication as to what the capture rate will be, if you will, partly due to the fact that the schools are new, and we aren't seeing graduates just yet. We only have two schools today in HCA markets where they're graduating students. And we're improving sequentially our capture rates, use your term in those two schools, and that's in Tampa and San Antonio, where we're seeing more Galen students land in HCA facilities. We have a very robust academic partnership strategy. It's not just Galen, Galen can't solve all of the nursing needs for the organization. They can complement it in a very significant way, as we've mentioned, but our broader academic partnership agenda is working with other great schools out there that provide nursing care. And we think what we can do is learn from our Galen experience and meet with other academic centers more effectively create a better experience for their students, and maybe a better pathway forward into HCA facilities in the future. We do have numerous programs that support HCA colleagues in getting nursing degrees. We have tuition support, we have other programs that create opportunities for our people inside of Galen, and we're continuing to evolve those. But I'm encouraged by some of the early indications of how many HCA colleagues were actually participating in Galen schools now. So we will hopefully see some benefit from that in the future. Well, we have gone through numerous recessionary cycles, just as other companies have gone through. And we're preparing ourselves for what that could be, if it does develop in this cycle. And Bill alluded to a number of the programs that we have, trying to make sure our efficiencies and other resiliency items are pushing forward regardless of the circumstance because we see value there and opportunities. I think what is potentially different in a very significant and structural way now is how the Affordable Care Act in exchanges and Medicaid expansion play in a recessionary cycle, we have never had that safety net during that type of cycle. In those past cycles, if a person was lost their job, they went into an uninsured ranks. I think what we have today is a unique safety net for those people in the Affordable Care Act programs that should provide some support by comparison to past cycles. Typically, we lag as many of you know, and how demand behaves in a recessionary cycle, but it provides labor relief also for us. So there's a balance between the two, HCA Healthcare has performed well in past recessionary cycles. And I'm confident that we can perform reasonably well in future recessionary cycles as we get more adaptability in our business and then again, as the Affordable Care Act provides some level of support that we hadn't seen in the past."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we'll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may -- we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to influence our results in the first quarter with the Omicron surge, which slowed in the middle of the quarter. More significantly, the challenging labor market pressured margins as the cost of labor increased more than we expected as compared to the first quarter of the prior year. In the face of these challenges, however, we had a number of positive volume and revenue indicators that were encouraging. Compared to the first quarter of prior year, same-facility admissions increased 2%. During the quarter we provided care to approximately 49,000 COVID-19 inpatients, which represented approximately 10% of total admissions, consistent with prior year. Non-COVID admissions grew 2.2%. This growth occurred in February and March. Inpatient surgeries grew approximately 1%. And across our inpatient business, acuity levels and payer mix continued to be strong. Outpatient volumes also rebounded strongly in the quarter. Same-facility emergency room visits grew 15%. Same-facility outpatient surgeries grew nearly 7%. And outpatient cardiac-related procedures grew by approximately 7%. We continue to believe that overall demand for health care remains strong in our markets across most categories, with favorable population trends and other contributing factors that developed during the pandemic driving it. Total revenues grew 6.9% compared to the first quarter 2021. Same-facility inpatient revenues grew 5.4%. And same-facility outpatient revenues grew 10.6%. Bill will provide more color on our revenues in his comments. I realize that our bottom line financial results were not what we expected, but these top line metrics were positive. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, were $4.12, which was down $0.02 from the prior year. In the quarter, we experienced higher levels of contract labor expenses than planned. As compared to the fourth quarter, we saw modest improvements in certain contract labor metrics. We expect further improvements in the remainder of the year as we align the workforce appropriately by reducing both the utilization of contract labor and the associated hourly rates for these contracts. In some situations, the challenges in the labor market also constrained our capacity, preventing us from delivering hospital services to certain patients. By the end of the quarter, we were able to overcome some of these capacity constraints. And for the most part, our transfer centers were able to operate normally and move more patients to the proper setting in our networks. It is important to understand, we are doing what we absolutely have to do to take care of our patients, and we will always do that. This past quarter, our teams continued to show up and deliver on our promise to provide high-quality care to patients who need our services. I want to thank them for their commitment and hard work during these challenging times. We do, however, have numerous initiatives underway around retention, recruitment, capacity management and new care models that we believe will help offset some of these labor pressures. However, we now believe improvement in our labor cost will be slower than originally anticipated. This factor primarily influenced our revised outlook for 2022. We will continue to invest in our people, in our relationships and in our networks. We believe these investments are appropriate and should help us address the long-term opportunities for growth that exists in our markets. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 2,500 facilities or sites of care in HCA Healthcare networks. This represents a 15% increase over last year. Recently, we published our Annual Impact Report for 2021, which highlights the tremendous impact our colleagues had on the patients and communities we serve. You can find the details on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me end my comments with this. Over the past few years, we have demonstrated an ability to adjust effectively to whatever our realities are, and I'm confident we will do it again.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Thank you.\nBill Rutherford: Okay. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments for the quarter and then address our 2022 updated guidance. First, let me provide a little more commentary on our revenues in the quarter. We are encouraged with certain trends we saw in our non-COVID activity during the quarter. Same-facility non-COVID admissions grew 2.2% versus the prior year, and our non-COVID revenue per admission grew 2.4% as a result of maintaining our acuity levels and a slightly favorable payer mix as compared to the prior year. Within our COVID activity, our same-facility COVID emissions were slightly above last year and represented approximately 10% of our total admissions, but we did see lower acuity and intensity with the Omicron variant this year. Our COVID inpatient revenue per admission was down approximately 15% from the first quarter of last year, which resulted in approximately $150 million less COVID revenue this year as compared to the first quarter of last year. Let me transition to discuss some cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our cash flow from operations was $1.345 billion as compared to $2 billion in the first quarter of 2021. We did pay $344 million of deferred payroll taxes from 2020 during this quarter, representing 50% of the total amount deferred. Capital spending was $860 million as compared to $650 million in the prior year period, and we completed just over $2.1 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was slightly below the low end of our target range, and we had just under $7.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. We plan to use approximately $2.6 billion of this amount to redeem our 2023 bonds in the second quarter. Finally, I will mention, as noted in our release this morning, during March of this year, CMS approved the direct to payment portion of the Texas Waiver Program. As a result, we recognized $385 million of revenue and $160 million of additional provider tax assessments related to this portion of the program from the period September 1, '21 through March 31, 2022. Of these amounts, approximately $244 million of the revenue and $90 million of the provider tax assessments related to the September through December of '21 period. As noted in our release this morning, we are adjusting our full year 2022 guidance as follows: We expect revenues to range between $59.5 billion and $61.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.95 billion and $5.34 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $16.40 and $17.60. And we expect capital spending to remain at $4.2 billion for the year. So let me provide some additional commentary on our adjusted guidance and 3 primary areas that we have considered. First, our cost of labor was higher than anticipated in the first quarter, primarily due to the utilization and cost of contract labor. We now believe the disruption of the labor market and the pressure this places on labor cost inflation will be slower to moderate than we originally anticipated. Second, as I previously discussed, we saw reduced acuity and revenue from Omicron COVID patients in the quarter, and this lower acuity has been factored into our guidance as well. And lastly, we made assumption around increased inflationary pressures and expect that to have greater impact on us going forward, including for professional fees, energy procurement, cost of utilities and other purchase services. So let me close with a brief discussion on some of the initiatives we have underway to respond to these current market dynamics. We've spoken in the past of our resiliency efforts, which now include 3 main focus areas. First is around staffing and capacity, as Sam mentioned in his comments. We have teams working on and focused on multiple work streams in this category. These work streams is centered around investing in and enhancing employee recruitment and retention efforts and enhancing capacity management through new case management models and technology solutions. In addition, we are exploring new delivery models through our care transformation initiatives. All of these are focused on supporting our care teams and easing some of the current labor pressures. Second, we have our original resiliency programs that are continuing. Many of these are advancing efficiencies through our next generation of shared services. Examples of these include a consolidation and alignment of laboratory operations, facility management, environmental and food and nutrition support areas. And then the third major effort underway is an initiative around advancing our capability to benchmark key performance metrics across the organization. This is intended to identify variation and opportunity to see our best practices across several areas, such as supply utilization, provider support costs, discretionary spending and other similar cost area. Many of these were factored into our original planning assumptions, and we remain focused on these efforts to help offset some of the contract labor and inflationary cost pressures we are experiencing. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank to open it up for Q&A.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. [Operator Instructions] Emma, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice : Maybe just try to drill down a little bit more on -- I know within the range, you've changed your outlook for EBITDA by about $650 million at the high end, $750 million at the low end. There's a lot of moving parts in the first quarter with what's happening with Texas supplemental payments. Can you tell us how much of that adjustment was due to what you saw in the first quarter? And how much is changing in your thinking for the rest of the year? And particularly, maybe just drill down on the labor comments about maybe what you were thinking before versus what you're thinking today in terms of use of contract labor rates and so forth, if there's anything that can be shared there.\nBill Rutherford: Yes, A.J., this is Bill. Let me give that a shot. So as we're looking forward and we're trying to take what we saw in the first quarter to make some assumptions and revision of our assumptions going forward, let's talk about the 3 areas. And first, as I mentioned, the pressure on the labor cost that what we're seeing is it's higher than we originally planned. It's primarily related to the use of contract labor. But we're also adjusting our base wage just to be responsive to the market as well. As I would think about it, our original plans was to kind of manage our overall cost per FTE somewhere between that 3% and 3.5% level. What we saw in the first quarter is our cost per FTE was about 1.5% higher than we expected. So as we forecast this going forward for the balance of the year, it could have a $400 million to $500 million impact. So we factored that into our guidance. The second area is regarding the Omicron variant, the less acuity in revenue, not only that we saw in the first quarter, but to the extent that we continue to see some COVID at a reduced level than what we saw in the first quarter, we factored that in. And then lastly, as I mentioned, just some inflationary increases above what we originally anticipated. So I think the way I would characterize it, approximately 2/3 of our revision, I would apply to kind of our wage and inflationary cost pressures and 1/3 of that due to the revenue acuity primarily to the COVID patients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: Embedded on the guidance reduction, can you walk us through the contract labor percent of nursing hours in fourth quarter, in the first quarter and how you assume that rolls off throughout the year. And then the same question on the rates for contract labor. And just because stocks had a big move today, any chance you guys can give us sort of a range for how we should be modeling 2Q EBITDA?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Peter, let me give a shot at that. I think we talked about on our fourth quarter call, our contract labor as a percent of nursing hours was around 11%. In the first quarter, it's about that level, too. We were 11.4% specifically in the fourth quarter, about 11.6% in the second quarter. We are experiencing elevated cost per hour of that contract labor, principally, we believe, related to the COVID surges. Our plans going forward are to continue to reduce the utilization of that contract labor and eventually moderate the average hourly rate that we're having to spend for that contract labor. But we think that moderation will be slower than we originally anticipated. So that's what's based in our assumptions, and it's basically influenced with what we saw in the fourth quarter.\nSam Hazen: Yes. And let me add to that, Pito, this is Sam. I think as we have gone through 2 years of up and down periods with surges, short-cycle normal period surges, another short-cycle normal period, we saw in the surges an acceleration in both turnover and the use of contract labor. As I mentioned on my prepared comments, we do what we got to do to take care of our patients. What we're anticipating is no more significant surges as we move through the rest of this year. And we -- that gives us some opportunity and some level of confidence that we can moderate the use of contract labor. And some of our other initiatives should provide support, recruitment, some of our retention efforts and so forth, giving us an opportunity to wean ourselves off the high levels of contract labor. And we saw that in the short cycles to a certain degree, but we never were able to sustain it simply because it was just that, a short cycle. So as we go through the rest of this year, we think the cycle will be longer with respect to those surge, and that will give us an opportunity to gain some traction with some of these initiatives. Our teams are working diligently across the facilities to make this happen. And again, I'm confident, just as we've done in the past, that we can make these adjustments over time and get us to where we need to be.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: First, just a quick follow-up on Pito's question. Can you give us a number as to where you expect to end the year on contract labor as a percentage? And just to confirm, does that sit in operating expense or other operating? Because that was the line item that looks like it was a bit off. And then my actual question is, Sam, just as you take a step back, right, there was a huge improvement in margins during COVID. It looks like they take a step back here. I'm just curious, do you think this is a sustainable margin or a sustainable EBITDA level to kind of think about jumping off for next year? Or do you think some of those improvements could help you close the gap versus where you were when you guided the year originally?\nBill Rutherford: Justin, this is Bill. Let me start with the first part of that. Without giving any specific numbers, you've heard us talk about, we expect to decrease the utilization. If I look before COVID, we will be hovering around 9% to 10% of ours. I don't know exactly, there are so many uncertainties, but we expect it to sequentially improve going forward. That does come through the SWB line, not the other operating. You did mention the other operating. It was primarily influenced with the provider tax assessments that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.\nSam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam, Just. With respect to the margins in the first quarter, I think the margins in the first quarter were clearly pressured, as we've indicated here, with somewhat unprecedented levels of cost on the labor side. We -- again, those costs were driven in some respects by the surge that we were reacting to and that pressured in a very significant way. I do believe, over time, we can recover some of that lost margin as we continue to appropriately align our workforce with more permanent workforce or more efficient workforce coming from the contract labor category. As -- setting a target, we don't necessarily have a target for contract labor. Obviously, in 2019, we were maybe half of what we're running today, somewhere in that zone. I don't know if that's realistic in the short run. But I'm hopeful in the intermediate run, with the number of initiatives that we have plus our Galen College of Nursing expansion program, that we can start to get back to those kind of levels. But I do think the first quarter was uniquely pressured from a margin standpoint simply because of the elevated levels of contract labor and the costs thereof.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Just want to maybe follow up on that question there. I think last quarter, you were talking about something like a 20% to 21% margin as kind of ultimately being sustainable. Is that the right way to think about it? Or have some of these things changed your view? And it sounds like, for the most part, you talked about recapturing margin, you're talking about cost savings. Is there anything on the rate side that is part of that equation? And if so, does that take a couple of years to play out? Or is that something that we can think about more normalized margins as soon as next year?\nBill Rutherford: Well, Kevin, if you look at our guidance, I think it would imply close to those 20% margin levels. Obviously, we've had to adjust some of our thinking, given kind of these inflationary cost pressures that we're seeing. So we're doing everything we can to operate the company as efficiently as possible. There's a lot of variables that we know go into margin. Volume, acuity, payer mix, continuing to manage our cost structures appropriately. So I would use that 19% to 20% level in the short run. And over time, we're going to continue to find ways to continue to operate efficiently.\nSam Hazen: On the payer contract, we are having more discussions. Obviously, the payers understand the inflationary pressures that providers have. And there's early discussions. It doesn't change our revenue mix in the 2022 period because we're largely contracted for 2022. But as we move into 2023 and 2024, Kevin, we have opportunities to utilize our payer contracts to get some relief from the inflationary pressures. And as we further our discussions with those commercial payers, I'm optimistic that we can gain some escalators that are more in line with the inflationary pressures of today versus the inflationary pressures of the past.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with SVB Securities.\nWhitMayo: Bill, what are you assuming in your algorithm this year for the guidance around COVID and non-COVID? I think you were assuming non-COVID was going to be, I don't know, 2% to 3% of the total. How has that shifted? And is there anything that you can share on how non-COVID, either inpatient, outpatient or anything, is tracking through April, that might just give us a sense of the run rate.\nBill Rutherford: I can't say April, Whit, at this point. But we said in our prepared remarks, non-COVID was up 2.2%. And that was really in February and March. In February and March, we were seeing 4.5% to 5%, potentially in those levels. So again, that's why I said we're encouraged by those trends. I don't think really what we saw in the fourth quarter really in broad terms affect our volume outlook. We still see good volume demand in the marketplaces. So originally, we said 2% to 3% volume growth, COVID still being between that, maybe 3% to 5% of our total admissions. And I think right now, I think that's mostly in line with our current expectations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.\nBen Hendrix: Just a real quick follow-up on the comment you made just a second ago, Sam, about improving efficiency of contract labor. We've always kind of characterized this as kind of the labor backdrop as the contract being the kind of transitory piece and wage inflation being more permanent. Is that -- can we read that kind of improving efficiency comment is maybe your expectation that contract labor utilization at higher rates is more of a permanent construct now going forward in the labor market?\nSam Hazen: Well, I think it's hard than it was in 2019. I don't think it will be hard than it was in the fourth quarter or the first quarter. I think rates will naturally come down as the surges subside and as workforce is aligned with more permanent staff and so forth. And so we're dealing in the first quarter and the fourth quarter and a little bit in the third quarter as well very high cost per hour for contract labor. And we do not believe that is sustainable. And so we're anticipating improvements in that. Additionally, I think we will see reductions in the number of contract labor personnel that we use. Again, as our initiatives gain traction, we've invested heavily in our recruiting function and really improved the candidate experience inside of that. We have some improving retention efforts and compensation programs that we think are going to support that component of our set of initiatives. So all of that leads us to believe that we can get the cost per FTE down from where it was in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And so that's our thinking.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho.\nAnn Hynes: Can you tell us -- when I look at inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions versus 2019, they're still down about 3%. Can you tell us what's embedded in guidance for 2022 versus the 2019 baseline trends, please?\nBill Rutherford: Ann, this is Bill. So as I mentioned before, we still believe we'll end up seeing 2% to 3% admissions for the full year '22. You're right, we are down a little on '19. I'd have to take a moment to see what that represents in \u201819, it's about 1% is what I think that would be our '21 number versus the baseline '19, would be down about 1%.\nSam Hazen: Yes, let me color that a little bit more, Bill, if I may, please. I think a couple of things when it comes to our same-store 2019 versus our same-store 2021. Our uninsured volumes are down 11% from 2019. So that's a very significant point. The second point I would say is we've had a fairly significant shift of orthopedic total joint surgeries go from inpatient to outpatient from 2019 to 2022. Again, that's put pressure on the admissions. Our surgeries were actually up over 2019. And then again, with our emergency room visits, if you look at the categories that are the paying categories were slightly up, but our uninsured activities were way down. So I think you got to look at the components of the business and understand the different components. And so the mix, slightly better shift inpatient to outpatient, which we've talked about over the last couple of years, and that influences the 2022 to 2019 comparison.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Wanted to think about seasonality of revenue and EBITDA if -- if you can here. Do we go back to sort of pre COVID and think about first quarter, fourth quarter EBITDA always being higher? Or do we think about J&J and some of the other device companies have said all-time high cancellations in January, things really started improving in March and April. And then obviously, you've got some anticipation that labor cost could ease a bit sequentially. So are we back to normal EBITDA seasonality yet? Or is the year still more complex? And can you help us a little.\nSam Hazen: I think a couple of things, Gary. Thank you for that question. The seasonality, we talked about this in the fourth quarter call, was really difficult for us to discern because, again, we were weaning ourselves off the Delta variant and then ramping up on the Omicron variant. I think the seasonality again, with our volume, is a bit uncertain to us right now. My sense is this could be a more normal period on seasonality for volume in 2022 than any that we've had over the last 2 years, obviously. But the seasonality on our costs, as we've indicated, I think are going to be different. And they're going to be different because we're at a high watermark on labor cost per FTE in the first quarter. And typically, our costs would go up seasonally. But we think as we work through the initiatives and the alignment of our workforce, we'll have a different pattern to our cost in 2022 than what we've had in previous years. And then hopefully, 2023 gets back to normal. So that's how we're thinking about it. Obviously, there's still months to come here for us to understand, in fact, if that does play out, but that's our thinking at this point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Sam, just to -- follow-up some questions on labor rate? So one question we're getting asked is, why now? Like you guys have done a great job managing through labor over the last 1.5 years? And maybe any color you can share on what you're thinking in terms of turnover on your perm nurses. And then I guess for Bill, to follow up to that, is you called out acuity as a driver of the revenue guidance cut. But as we pull back on temp staff, is there going to be an impact in labor -- or on volumes that we should be thinking about?\nSam Hazen: So the first half of last year, our costs were not in what I call an elevated state from the labor. And we mentioned this on our third quarter call, we also mentioned it again on the fourth quarter call and now we're mentioning it on the first quarter call. So we're working ourselves out of some comparisons, number one. But our costs of labor were dramatically disrupted in the Delta variant for a couple of reasons. One, we jumped our census from the second quarter to the third quarter by 8.5%. We had record census levels in the company in the third quarter. Not for the third quarter, but forever. And that forced us to respond to those patients in an appropriate way. The market -- the labor market was being tremendously impacted during the summer of 2021. And we had to use more contract labor at that time than we had in previous periods. Well, that's continued into the fourth quarter and then to the first quarter. Again, we think some of that is influenced significantly by the surges. So that's part of what reoccurred. As Bill alluded to it, the Delta variant was the most intense revenue patient population that we had. So the third quarter covered a lot of that cost because the revenue intensity of the Delta patients was quite high. The fourth quarter had a blend of Delta and Omicron and it still was higher than the first quarter. And so the labor costs really haven't changed per FTE in 3 quarters. I'm considering that to be a good thing. And I'm also considering it to be the opportunity because we're using too much contract labor and it's still at elevated outsized rates. And so our rate trend has continued in the quarter to be reduced. I think our contract labor cost per hour in the first quarter was down 5% from the fourth quarter. And within the quarter -- within the first quarter, it was better each month, month over month. Again, it gives us some confidence that the assumptions we're making for the remainder of the year are reasonable. So that's part of why it doesn't look like we manage through it in historical ways. Our productivity is at a very efficient level when it comes to employees per patient. So we're managing on that front as well as we possibly can. And as, again, we get these other underlying initiatives into a normal period hopefully of no COVID surges, we're going to gain ground on the pressure that we've experienced over the past 3 quarters.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Brian, you got a follow-up question. As I think Sam mentioned, too, in his comments, there's always the potential where the labor pressures could affect your volume. What we've seen now is in COVID surges as we manage through transfers, again, I think as Sam alluded in his comments, at the end of the quarter, we were really back to our normal levels, but we're continuing to manage through that dynamic.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : So we just had the Medicare IPPS proposal [contract] for 2023 and certainly had a couple of different moving pieces on that. So I thought it would be helpful if you can give us the gross versus net sort of projection for your rates from that proposal. And then just more broadly, how you feel about CMS sort of factoring in this inflationary pressure and ultimately if you think that CMS will start to factor that in more accurately as we look out maybe to FY '24 and beyond.\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Scott, this is Bill. I mean, obviously, we're still assessing it. But I think on first blush, we thought kind of the gross increase we saw would be hovering just under 2%. That's pretty consistent with what we've seen. But I think to your point, it does get netted out when we see the delay in the sequestration cuts out there. So we'll still assess that. So it may move it closer to flat net-net all-in, but we're seeing at the top line just under 2% growth on that. And so we'll see how the final rule comes out as we go through comments.\nSam Hazen: Yes. And in forward years, typically, it takes a little bit for the wage index to be adjusted to reflect what's going on in the industry. So I think as '21 and '22 start to get baked into the formula for inflation around the wage indexes of the hospital industry, it will start to influence the reimbursement in slightly different ways.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok with UBS.\nAndrew Mok: Just wanted to follow up on the revenue commentary. Can you take us through the components of the lower revenue guidance in more detail, maybe help bucket the $500 million decline between volume, acuity and mix. And are there any other government-related items that you would call out in that revenue decline?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Andrew, this is Bill. I would tell you it's principally related to the drop in the COVID acuity that I mentioned in my comments. And we're estimating it to be approximately $150 million in the quarter. COVID, obviously, was higher at 10% of our admissions than we expect in the full year. But if you run that out, I would say the vast majority of that revenue decline would be due to the lower acuity that we're seeing with the Omicron variant and expect to see going forward. And outside of that, there's no other really major item that I would call out, just the ebb and flow of kind of normal volume patterns.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Just wanted to ask another one on the labor market. So I'm sure part of your process around this issue involves a great degree of competitive intelligence about what's going on in our markets. I was hoping you could share a little bit about what you're seeing from your local market competitors and whether there are strategies around contract labor or employed labor forward, so even maybe potentially putting certain service lines on pause or maybe exacerbating some of the pressures you're feeling. I guess, big picture, do you think they're being as disciplined as you are? And if not, how should we think about the longer-term implications of that?\nSam Hazen: So from a competitive standpoint, I mean, obviously, our wage programs have to be competitive. And that means different things in different circumstances. And we have made adjustments to our compensation programs, really starting back in the third quarter of '21, to respond to some of the market dynamics. We continue to be very fluid in that particular area of our business in responding to the different circumstances from one market to the other. I would say that we think we're in a pretty good spot. We haven't seen any unusual maneuvers broadly. We are fortunate again to have competitors that tend to be only local and in 1 market or 2 markets at the most. So we don't see sort of patterns that permeate all 43 markets for HCA Healthcare. And so that's a positive on that front. But we haven't seen anything unique yet from the competitive landscape with contract labor and so forth. But I've got to believe that they are facing many of the same challenges as we do. And I believe over time we've been able to use our operating discipline, use our systems, use the learnings that we have across the company to create advantage for us. And I believe we will continue to do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephro Research.\nJoshua Raskin: Quick follow-up on contract labor. How long are those typical contracts in place? And then my real question is, are you having any issues with discharges, post-acute discharges? Is that impacting length of stay, driving up cost and, obviously, the same DRG, the same payment?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Josh, it's Bill. Typically, those contracts range around 13 weeks. So it takes time to adjust. But given the size, they're always flowing through our system on there. And relative to post-acute and discharge planning, I would say, yes. I think that's part of our case management initiatives that I spoke to in my prepared comments. I think the supply and demand dynamics in post-acute, whether it be skilled nursing or other post-acute settings, from time to time can cause a backup in our discharges. And that's why we're trying to advance and utilize some technologies, advance a common organizational structure around case management so we can continue to focus on that and improve that length of stay when patients are ready to go home and there's appropriate levels of discharges. That is a dynamic out there. There's no doubt about it. But I think we're focusing a lot of effort and energy and resources to try to continue to improve in that area.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi.\nJason Cassorla: I just want to go back to your comments around the initiatives for retention recruitment capacity management and new care models. Can you just help in terms of what is different with these initiatives today maybe compared to perhaps how you utilized these initiatives back in 3Q '21 when labor was picking up. Is it just more intensity there? Or are you leveraging incremental levers that maybe weren't considered or previously -- utilized back then? And then if possible, can you help quantify the offset of these programs or initiatives related to the $400 million to $500 million net pressure regarding the higher wages and costs with the revised guidance?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. I'll start and I'll let Sam kick in. I think it's a mix of both escalating existing initiatives and new ones. One, I'll give an example, and Sam mentioned this earlier, around recruitment. We've increased our investment in recruiter significantly. And that's been a really intentional effort. Same around retention. We're putting common retention strategies across the organization on there. And then the case management that I mentioned in my comments, we recently approved an effort to really align organizationally around our case management strategies. And we're investing in new technologies to give us better predictive assessments of patients' needs at discharge. So it's a combination of accelerating and emphasizing existing efforts as well as implementing new ones. And it kind of touches all bases, if you will, between recruitment, retention, capacity management. And new care models, as you know, can we -- can we bring new support staff to support the care teams, whether it be through patient care techs, through patient safety attendance and the like. So we've got a number of initiatives to try to just, as I said in my comments, continue to support the team and ease those pressures. I would say in our guidance, in our original guidance, we had already factored in some impact of those. And we're going to continue to focus on those to try to, I think, counter some of the market pressures that we are seeing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.\nJamie Perse: Question on volumes. Last year, the timing of the COVID wave was pretty similar to what it looked like this year. You had a really nice acceleration in 2Q last year in terms of volumes across the board. What are you seeing now in terms of volumes? And is last year's experience a good proxy for how we should be thinking about the acceleration into 2Q? And then just one quick follow-up. Can you guys give us what percent of your Managed Care contracts are in place for 2023?\nSam Hazen: So February and March, which were obviously months post Omicron surge, behaved similarly to the holiday surge that occurred at the end of 2020 and on into the first part of 2021. Again, we had solid non-COVID admission growth in February and March, as Bill alluded to, in the mid-single digits. So we're encouraged by that. There's nothing to suggest that the patterns will be different. But again, we're learning, obviously, as we go through these patterns and we're hopeful that we won't have any more surges and we'll be able to judge some of these patterns more effectively. With respect to our payer contracts, we're about 50% contracted for 2023 and about 30% contracted for 2024. Again, those capacities in each of those years give us opportunities to adjust some of the inflationary expectations to the realities that we have today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James of Barclays.\nSarah James: You've been talking about the majority of the pressure being on temp labor, but I was hoping you could unpack that a little bit. Are you talking about 2/3, 1/3 temp labor to kind of the longer-tailed items like wage inflation and bonuses or a more extreme split? And you guys are in a unique position owning a nursing school. So are you seeing any shift in what field students are selecting? And how is that influencing your strategy?\nSam Hazen: I don't know, Bill, if we -- if I have the split right in front of me to be able to answer the first question, but let me speak to the second question. We can get back to you on that first question with a little bit more specificity if we can. It's still early for us with the Galen College of Nursing programs and expansions. But just looking at some of the new schools that we've opened, Austin, Texas, Nashville, Tennessee, parts of South Carolina, the enrollment in a couple of those situations is record level enrollment in nursing program in the Galen College of Nursing. So we've seen a really robust initial enrollment. That gives us confidence. We also believe that we have an opportunity to integrate those students into our organization to support current needs as well as hopefully create synergy as they graduate the program and want to come to work for HCA Healthcare. So we're really encouraged by the prospects. But again, that's more intermediate run, kind of a gain, although there will be some short run with nurse externs and rotations and so forth that we can utilize, hopefully effectively, to support current day needs. But the initial enrollment in a number of these new schools would suggest that there's still a reasonable supply of students who want to go into nursing schools. Maybe circle back to -- I guess -- I think you'll have an answer to your second question.\nBill Rutherford: No, no, I don't have an answer, Sarah. We'll have to get back with you. I think our overall labor mark is a combination of the temporary labor and some of the base wage inflation. I can't split it for you exactly. We'll get back with you on that. But it's a combination of both.\nSarah James: Just to clarify on the nursing school. I was trying to understand like the structural shift that's going on, if your graduating nurses are selecting one field like surgical versus home health versus like if you're seeing just like a structural shift in where graduating nurses are going.\nSam Hazen: No, no, we're not.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatt Borsch: Question is off topic for the quarter, but there's -- I have been following this closely, but there's been obviously an ongoing dialogue around compliance with the price transparency regulations. And I know there's a lot of complexity to the implementation. But can you just address where, from your standpoint, you are with that? And what -- when you would expect to get, if not already, to full compliance on that?\nSam Hazen: Well, I was going to say, we believe we are compliant with the CMS rules, which are tremendously complex and in many ways difficult to implement because of the variations that exist from one commercial contract to another and from one market to another. So we have, through our -- an internal process, established a program that we believe and CMS has validated in certain circumstances, is compliant. And we continue to try to refine those presentations in ways that, again, satisfied CMS' evolving interpretation as well as our ability to adjust some of our postings to meet the evolving requirements.\nFrank Morgan : Thank you very much. I'll turn it back over to Emma.\nOperator: Your last question today comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.\nBenHendrix: Just to get to that 1/3 of the guide down that's related to the lower acuity on COVID volume, is there any way to give us an idea of the margin differential between the lower acuity patients you've seen through Omicron versus COVID patients historically and then versus a non-COVID inpatient admission?\nBill Rutherford: No. I think we'd have to follow up off-line on that. I don't have any specifics in front of me of the specific margins. But I do know when we have the acuity drop like we did, the revenue does flow through pretty much down to margin. But I don't have exact percentages that I could share with you between these various variants that we've seen.\nFrank Morgan: Okay. Emma, I think that's about it now.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session.\nFrank Morgan: All right. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments for the quarter and then address our 2022 updated guidance. First, let me provide a little more commentary on our revenues in the quarter. We are encouraged with certain trends we saw in our non-COVID activity during the quarter. Same-facility non-COVID admissions grew 2.2% versus the prior year, and our non-COVID revenue per admission grew 2.4% as a result of maintaining our acuity levels and a slightly favorable payer mix as compared to the prior year. Within our COVID activity, our same-facility COVID emissions were slightly above last year and represented approximately 10% of our total admissions, but we did see lower acuity and intensity with the Omicron variant this year. Our COVID inpatient revenue per admission was down approximately 15% from the first quarter of last year, which resulted in approximately $150 million less COVID revenue this year as compared to the first quarter of last year. Let me transition to discuss some cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our cash flow from operations was $1.345 billion as compared to $2 billion in the first quarter of 2021. We did pay $344 million of deferred payroll taxes from 2020 during this quarter, representing 50% of the total amount deferred. Capital spending was $860 million as compared to $650 million in the prior year period, and we completed just over $2.1 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was slightly below the low end of our target range, and we had just under $7.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. We plan to use approximately $2.6 billion of this amount to redeem our 2023 bonds in the second quarter. Finally, I will mention, as noted in our release this morning, during March of this year, CMS approved the direct to payment portion of the Texas Waiver Program. As a result, we recognized $385 million of revenue and $160 million of additional provider tax assessments related to this portion of the program from the period September 1, '21 through March 31, 2022. Of these amounts, approximately $244 million of the revenue and $90 million of the provider tax assessments related to the September through December of '21 period. As noted in our release this morning, we are adjusting our full year 2022 guidance as follows: We expect revenues to range between $59.5 billion and $61.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.95 billion and $5.34 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $16.40 and $17.60. And we expect capital spending to remain at $4.2 billion for the year. So let me provide some additional commentary on our adjusted guidance and 3 primary areas that we have considered. First, our cost of labor was higher than anticipated in the first quarter, primarily due to the utilization and cost of contract labor. We now believe the disruption of the labor market and the pressure this places on labor cost inflation will be slower to moderate than we originally anticipated. Second, as I previously discussed, we saw reduced acuity and revenue from Omicron COVID patients in the quarter, and this lower acuity has been factored into our guidance as well. And lastly, we made assumption around increased inflationary pressures and expect that to have greater impact on us going forward, including for professional fees, energy procurement, cost of utilities and other purchase services. So let me close with a brief discussion on some of the initiatives we have underway to respond to these current market dynamics. We've spoken in the past of our resiliency efforts, which now include 3 main focus areas. First is around staffing and capacity, as Sam mentioned in his comments. We have teams working on and focused on multiple work streams in this category. These work streams is centered around investing in and enhancing employee recruitment and retention efforts and enhancing capacity management through new case management models and technology solutions. In addition, we are exploring new delivery models through our care transformation initiatives. All of these are focused on supporting our care teams and easing some of the current labor pressures. Second, we have our original resiliency programs that are continuing. Many of these are advancing efficiencies through our next generation of shared services. Examples of these include a consolidation and alignment of laboratory operations, facility management, environmental and food and nutrition support areas. And then the third major effort underway is an initiative around advancing our capability to benchmark key performance metrics across the organization. This is intended to identify variation and opportunity to see our best practices across several areas, such as supply utilization, provider support costs, discretionary spending and other similar cost area. Many of these were factored into our original planning assumptions, and we remain focused on these efforts to help offset some of the contract labor and inflationary cost pressures we are experiencing. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank to open it up for Q&A. Yes, A.J., this is Bill. Let me give that a shot. So as we're looking forward and we're trying to take what we saw in the first quarter to make some assumptions and revision of our assumptions going forward, let's talk about the 3 areas. And first, as I mentioned, the pressure on the labor cost that what we're seeing is it's higher than we originally planned. It's primarily related to the use of contract labor. But we're also adjusting our base wage just to be responsive to the market as well. As I would think about it, our original plans was to kind of manage our overall cost per FTE somewhere between that 3% and 3.5% level. What we saw in the first quarter is our cost per FTE was about 1.5% higher than we expected. So as we forecast this going forward for the balance of the year, it could have a $400 million to $500 million impact. So we factored that into our guidance. The second area is regarding the Omicron variant, the less acuity in revenue, not only that we saw in the first quarter, but to the extent that we continue to see some COVID at a reduced level than what we saw in the first quarter, we factored that in. And then lastly, as I mentioned, just some inflationary increases above what we originally anticipated. So I think the way I would characterize it, approximately 2/3 of our revision, I would apply to kind of our wage and inflationary cost pressures and 1/3 of that due to the revenue acuity primarily to the COVID patients. Yes. Peter, let me give a shot at that. I think we talked about on our fourth quarter call, our contract labor as a percent of nursing hours was around 11%. In the first quarter, it's about that level, too. We were 11.4% specifically in the fourth quarter, about 11.6% in the second quarter. We are experiencing elevated cost per hour of that contract labor, principally, we believe, related to the COVID surges. Our plans going forward are to continue to reduce the utilization of that contract labor and eventually moderate the average hourly rate that we're having to spend for that contract labor. But we think that moderation will be slower than we originally anticipated. So that's what's based in our assumptions, and it's basically influenced with what we saw in the fourth quarter. Justin, this is Bill. Let me start with the first part of that. Without giving any specific numbers, you've heard us talk about, we expect to decrease the utilization. If I look before COVID, we will be hovering around 9% to 10% of ours. I don't know exactly, there are so many uncertainties, but we expect it to sequentially improve going forward. That does come through the SWB line, not the other operating. You did mention the other operating. It was primarily influenced with the provider tax assessments that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Well, Kevin, if you look at our guidance, I think it would imply close to those 20% margin levels. Obviously, we've had to adjust some of our thinking, given kind of these inflationary cost pressures that we're seeing. So we're doing everything we can to operate the company as efficiently as possible. There's a lot of variables that we know go into margin. Volume, acuity, payer mix, continuing to manage our cost structures appropriately. So I would use that 19% to 20% level in the short run. And over time, we're going to continue to find ways to continue to operate efficiently. I can't say April, Whit, at this point. But we said in our prepared remarks, non-COVID was up 2.2%. And that was really in February and March. In February and March, we were seeing 4.5% to 5%, potentially in those levels. So again, that's why I said we're encouraged by those trends. I don't think really what we saw in the fourth quarter really in broad terms affect our volume outlook. We still see good volume demand in the marketplaces. So originally, we said 2% to 3% volume growth, COVID still being between that, maybe 3% to 5% of our total admissions. And I think right now, I think that's mostly in line with our current expectations. Ann, this is Bill. So as I mentioned before, we still believe we'll end up seeing 2% to 3% admissions for the full year '22. You're right, we are down a little on '19. I'd have to take a moment to see what that represents in \u201819, it's about 1% is what I think that would be our '21 number versus the baseline '19, would be down about 1%. Yes. Brian, you got a follow-up question. As I think Sam mentioned, too, in his comments, there's always the potential where the labor pressures could affect your volume. What we've seen now is in COVID surges as we manage through transfers, again, I think as Sam alluded in his comments, at the end of the quarter, we were really back to our normal levels, but we're continuing to manage through that dynamic. Yes, Scott, this is Bill. I mean, obviously, we're still assessing it. But I think on first blush, we thought kind of the gross increase we saw would be hovering just under 2%. That's pretty consistent with what we've seen. But I think to your point, it does get netted out when we see the delay in the sequestration cuts out there. So we'll still assess that. So it may move it closer to flat net-net all-in, but we're seeing at the top line just under 2% growth on that. And so we'll see how the final rule comes out as we go through comments. Yes, Andrew, this is Bill. I would tell you it's principally related to the drop in the COVID acuity that I mentioned in my comments. And we're estimating it to be approximately $150 million in the quarter. COVID, obviously, was higher at 10% of our admissions than we expect in the full year. But if you run that out, I would say the vast majority of that revenue decline would be due to the lower acuity that we're seeing with the Omicron variant and expect to see going forward. And outside of that, there's no other really major item that I would call out, just the ebb and flow of kind of normal volume patterns. Yes, Josh, it's Bill. Typically, those contracts range around 13 weeks. So it takes time to adjust. But given the size, they're always flowing through our system on there. And relative to post-acute and discharge planning, I would say, yes. I think that's part of our case management initiatives that I spoke to in my prepared comments. I think the supply and demand dynamics in post-acute, whether it be skilled nursing or other post-acute settings, from time to time can cause a backup in our discharges. And that's why we're trying to advance and utilize some technologies, advance a common organizational structure around case management so we can continue to focus on that and improve that length of stay when patients are ready to go home and there's appropriate levels of discharges. That is a dynamic out there. There's no doubt about it. But I think we're focusing a lot of effort and energy and resources to try to continue to improve in that area. Yes. I'll start and I'll let Sam kick in. I think it's a mix of both escalating existing initiatives and new ones. One, I'll give an example, and Sam mentioned this earlier, around recruitment. We've increased our investment in recruiter significantly. And that's been a really intentional effort. Same around retention. We're putting common retention strategies across the organization on there. And then the case management that I mentioned in my comments, we recently approved an effort to really align organizationally around our case management strategies. And we're investing in new technologies to give us better predictive assessments of patients' needs at discharge. So it's a combination of accelerating and emphasizing existing efforts as well as implementing new ones. And it kind of touches all bases, if you will, between recruitment, retention, capacity management. And new care models, as you know, can we -- can we bring new support staff to support the care teams, whether it be through patient care techs, through patient safety attendance and the like. So we've got a number of initiatives to try to just, as I said in my comments, continue to support the team and ease those pressures. I would say in our guidance, in our original guidance, we had already factored in some impact of those. And we're going to continue to focus on those to try to, I think, counter some of the market pressures that we are seeing. No, no, I don't have an answer, Sarah. We'll have to get back with you. I think our overall labor mark is a combination of the temporary labor and some of the base wage inflation. I can't split it for you exactly. We'll get back with you on that. But it's a combination of both. No. I think we'd have to follow up off-line on that. I don't have any specifics in front of me of the specific margins. But I do know when we have the acuity drop like we did, the revenue does flow through pretty much down to margin. But I don't have exact percentages that I could share with you between these various variants that we've seen."

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to influence our results in the first quarter with the Omicron surge, which slowed in the middle of the quarter. More significantly, the challenging labor market pressured margins as the cost of labor increased more than we expected as compared to the first quarter of the prior year. In the face of these challenges, however, we had a number of positive volume and revenue indicators that were encouraging. Compared to the first quarter of prior year, same-facility admissions increased 2%. During the quarter we provided care to approximately 49,000 COVID-19 inpatients, which represented approximately 10% of total admissions, consistent with prior year. Non-COVID admissions grew 2.2%. This growth occurred in February and March. Inpatient surgeries grew approximately 1%. And across our inpatient business, acuity levels and payer mix continued to be strong. Outpatient volumes also rebounded strongly in the quarter. Same-facility emergency room visits grew 15%. Same-facility outpatient surgeries grew nearly 7%. And outpatient cardiac-related procedures grew by approximately 7%. We continue to believe that overall demand for health care remains strong in our markets across most categories, with favorable population trends and other contributing factors that developed during the pandemic driving it. Total revenues grew 6.9% compared to the first quarter 2021. Same-facility inpatient revenues grew 5.4%. And same-facility outpatient revenues grew 10.6%. Bill will provide more color on our revenues in his comments. I realize that our bottom line financial results were not what we expected, but these top line metrics were positive. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, were $4.12, which was down $0.02 from the prior year. In the quarter, we experienced higher levels of contract labor expenses than planned. As compared to the fourth quarter, we saw modest improvements in certain contract labor metrics. We expect further improvements in the remainder of the year as we align the workforce appropriately by reducing both the utilization of contract labor and the associated hourly rates for these contracts. In some situations, the challenges in the labor market also constrained our capacity, preventing us from delivering hospital services to certain patients. By the end of the quarter, we were able to overcome some of these capacity constraints. And for the most part, our transfer centers were able to operate normally and move more patients to the proper setting in our networks. It is important to understand, we are doing what we absolutely have to do to take care of our patients, and we will always do that. This past quarter, our teams continued to show up and deliver on our promise to provide high-quality care to patients who need our services. I want to thank them for their commitment and hard work during these challenging times. We do, however, have numerous initiatives underway around retention, recruitment, capacity management and new care models that we believe will help offset some of these labor pressures. However, we now believe improvement in our labor cost will be slower than originally anticipated. This factor primarily influenced our revised outlook for 2022. We will continue to invest in our people, in our relationships and in our networks. We believe these investments are appropriate and should help us address the long-term opportunities for growth that exists in our markets. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 2,500 facilities or sites of care in HCA Healthcare networks. This represents a 15% increase over last year. Recently, we published our Annual Impact Report for 2021, which highlights the tremendous impact our colleagues had on the patients and communities we serve. You can find the details on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me end my comments with this. Over the past few years, we have demonstrated an ability to adjust effectively to whatever our realities are, and I'm confident we will do it again.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Thank you. Yes. And let me add to that, Pito, this is Sam. I think as we have gone through 2 years of up and down periods with surges, short-cycle normal period surges, another short-cycle normal period, we saw in the surges an acceleration in both turnover and the use of contract labor. As I mentioned on my prepared comments, we do what we got to do to take care of our patients. What we're anticipating is no more significant surges as we move through the rest of this year. And we -- that gives us some opportunity and some level of confidence that we can moderate the use of contract labor. And some of our other initiatives should provide support, recruitment, some of our retention efforts and so forth, giving us an opportunity to wean ourselves off the high levels of contract labor. And we saw that in the short cycles to a certain degree, but we never were able to sustain it simply because it was just that, a short cycle. So as we go through the rest of this year, we think the cycle will be longer with respect to those surge, and that will give us an opportunity to gain some traction with some of these initiatives. Our teams are working diligently across the facilities to make this happen. And again, I'm confident, just as we've done in the past, that we can make these adjustments over time and get us to where we need to be. Yes. This is Sam, Just. With respect to the margins in the first quarter, I think the margins in the first quarter were clearly pressured, as we've indicated here, with somewhat unprecedented levels of cost on the labor side. We -- again, those costs were driven in some respects by the surge that we were reacting to and that pressured in a very significant way. I do believe, over time, we can recover some of that lost margin as we continue to appropriately align our workforce with more permanent workforce or more efficient workforce coming from the contract labor category. As -- setting a target, we don't necessarily have a target for contract labor. Obviously, in 2019, we were maybe half of what we're running today, somewhere in that zone. I don't know if that's realistic in the short run. But I'm hopeful in the intermediate run, with the number of initiatives that we have plus our Galen College of Nursing expansion program, that we can start to get back to those kind of levels. But I do think the first quarter was uniquely pressured from a margin standpoint simply because of the elevated levels of contract labor and the costs thereof. On the payer contract, we are having more discussions. Obviously, the payers understand the inflationary pressures that providers have. And there's early discussions. It doesn't change our revenue mix in the 2022 period because we're largely contracted for 2022. But as we move into 2023 and 2024, Kevin, we have opportunities to utilize our payer contracts to get some relief from the inflationary pressures. And as we further our discussions with those commercial payers, I'm optimistic that we can gain some escalators that are more in line with the inflationary pressures of today versus the inflationary pressures of the past. Well, I think it's hard than it was in 2019. I don't think it will be hard than it was in the fourth quarter or the first quarter. I think rates will naturally come down as the surges subside and as workforce is aligned with more permanent staff and so forth. And so we're dealing in the first quarter and the fourth quarter and a little bit in the third quarter as well very high cost per hour for contract labor. And we do not believe that is sustainable. And so we're anticipating improvements in that. Additionally, I think we will see reductions in the number of contract labor personnel that we use. Again, as our initiatives gain traction, we've invested heavily in our recruiting function and really improved the candidate experience inside of that. We have some improving retention efforts and compensation programs that we think are going to support that component of our set of initiatives. So all of that leads us to believe that we can get the cost per FTE down from where it was in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And so that's our thinking. Yes, let me color that a little bit more, Bill, if I may, please. I think a couple of things when it comes to our same-store 2019 versus our same-store 2021. Our uninsured volumes are down 11% from 2019. So that's a very significant point. The second point I would say is we've had a fairly significant shift of orthopedic total joint surgeries go from inpatient to outpatient from 2019 to 2022. Again, that's put pressure on the admissions. Our surgeries were actually up over 2019. And then again, with our emergency room visits, if you look at the categories that are the paying categories were slightly up, but our uninsured activities were way down. So I think you got to look at the components of the business and understand the different components. And so the mix, slightly better shift inpatient to outpatient, which we've talked about over the last couple of years, and that influences the 2022 to 2019 comparison. I think a couple of things, Gary. Thank you for that question. The seasonality, we talked about this in the fourth quarter call, was really difficult for us to discern because, again, we were weaning ourselves off the Delta variant and then ramping up on the Omicron variant. I think the seasonality again, with our volume, is a bit uncertain to us right now. My sense is this could be a more normal period on seasonality for volume in 2022 than any that we've had over the last 2 years, obviously. But the seasonality on our costs, as we've indicated, I think are going to be different. And they're going to be different because we're at a high watermark on labor cost per FTE in the first quarter. And typically, our costs would go up seasonally. But we think as we work through the initiatives and the alignment of our workforce, we'll have a different pattern to our cost in 2022 than what we've had in previous years. And then hopefully, 2023 gets back to normal. So that's how we're thinking about it. Obviously, there's still months to come here for us to understand, in fact, if that does play out, but that's our thinking at this point. So the first half of last year, our costs were not in what I call an elevated state from the labor. And we mentioned this on our third quarter call, we also mentioned it again on the fourth quarter call and now we're mentioning it on the first quarter call. So we're working ourselves out of some comparisons, number one. But our costs of labor were dramatically disrupted in the Delta variant for a couple of reasons. One, we jumped our census from the second quarter to the third quarter by 8.5%. We had record census levels in the company in the third quarter. Not for the third quarter, but forever. And that forced us to respond to those patients in an appropriate way. The market -- the labor market was being tremendously impacted during the summer of 2021. And we had to use more contract labor at that time than we had in previous periods. Well, that's continued into the fourth quarter and then to the first quarter. Again, we think some of that is influenced significantly by the surges. So that's part of what reoccurred. As Bill alluded to it, the Delta variant was the most intense revenue patient population that we had. So the third quarter covered a lot of that cost because the revenue intensity of the Delta patients was quite high. The fourth quarter had a blend of Delta and Omicron and it still was higher than the first quarter. And so the labor costs really haven't changed per FTE in 3 quarters. I'm considering that to be a good thing. And I'm also considering it to be the opportunity because we're using too much contract labor and it's still at elevated outsized rates. And so our rate trend has continued in the quarter to be reduced. I think our contract labor cost per hour in the first quarter was down 5% from the fourth quarter. And within the quarter -- within the first quarter, it was better each month, month over month. Again, it gives us some confidence that the assumptions we're making for the remainder of the year are reasonable. So that's part of why it doesn't look like we manage through it in historical ways. Our productivity is at a very efficient level when it comes to employees per patient. So we're managing on that front as well as we possibly can. And as, again, we get these other underlying initiatives into a normal period hopefully of no COVID surges, we're going to gain ground on the pressure that we've experienced over the past 3 quarters. Yes. And in forward years, typically, it takes a little bit for the wage index to be adjusted to reflect what's going on in the industry. So I think as '21 and '22 start to get baked into the formula for inflation around the wage indexes of the hospital industry, it will start to influence the reimbursement in slightly different ways. So from a competitive standpoint, I mean, obviously, our wage programs have to be competitive. And that means different things in different circumstances. And we have made adjustments to our compensation programs, really starting back in the third quarter of '21, to respond to some of the market dynamics. We continue to be very fluid in that particular area of our business in responding to the different circumstances from one market to the other. I would say that we think we're in a pretty good spot. We haven't seen any unusual maneuvers broadly. We are fortunate again to have competitors that tend to be only local and in 1 market or 2 markets at the most. So we don't see sort of patterns that permeate all 43 markets for HCA Healthcare. And so that's a positive on that front. But we haven't seen anything unique yet from the competitive landscape with contract labor and so forth. But I've got to believe that they are facing many of the same challenges as we do. And I believe over time we've been able to use our operating discipline, use our systems, use the learnings that we have across the company to create advantage for us. And I believe we will continue to do that. So February and March, which were obviously months post Omicron surge, behaved similarly to the holiday surge that occurred at the end of 2020 and on into the first part of 2021. Again, we had solid non-COVID admission growth in February and March, as Bill alluded to, in the mid-single digits. So we're encouraged by that. There's nothing to suggest that the patterns will be different. But again, we're learning, obviously, as we go through these patterns and we're hopeful that we won't have any more surges and we'll be able to judge some of these patterns more effectively. With respect to our payer contracts, we're about 50% contracted for 2023 and about 30% contracted for 2024. Again, those capacities in each of those years give us opportunities to adjust some of the inflationary expectations to the realities that we have today. I don't know, Bill, if we -- if I have the split right in front of me to be able to answer the first question, but let me speak to the second question. We can get back to you on that first question with a little bit more specificity if we can. It's still early for us with the Galen College of Nursing programs and expansions. But just looking at some of the new schools that we've opened, Austin, Texas, Nashville, Tennessee, parts of South Carolina, the enrollment in a couple of those situations is record level enrollment in nursing program in the Galen College of Nursing. So we've seen a really robust initial enrollment. That gives us confidence. We also believe that we have an opportunity to integrate those students into our organization to support current needs as well as hopefully create synergy as they graduate the program and want to come to work for HCA Healthcare. So we're really encouraged by the prospects. But again, that's more intermediate run, kind of a gain, although there will be some short run with nurse externs and rotations and so forth that we can utilize, hopefully effectively, to support current day needs. But the initial enrollment in a number of these new schools would suggest that there's still a reasonable supply of students who want to go into nursing schools. Maybe circle back to -- I guess -- I think you'll have an answer to your second question. No, no, we're not. Well, I was going to say, we believe we are compliant with the CMS rules, which are tremendously complex and in many ways difficult to implement because of the variations that exist from one commercial contract to another and from one market to another. So we have, through our -- an internal process, established a program that we believe and CMS has validated in certain circumstances, is compliant. And we continue to try to refine those presentations in ways that, again, satisfied CMS' evolving interpretation as well as our ability to adjust some of our postings to meet the evolving requirements."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: All right. Good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining the call. We finished 2023 better than expected across most dimensions of our business. In the quarter, we experienced strong demand for services across our diversified portfolio of markets, facilities and service lines. This growth, coupled with improved cost trends drove solid financial performance in the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales were $5.90, which represented a 27% increase over prior year. We are encouraged by these results and believe the operational momentum we have created should position us well for 2024. As mentioned at our recent Investor Day, the staying power of HCA Healthcare was on display again throughout the year. Diluted earnings per share excluding gains and losses on sales and debt retirement for the year grew almost 13% as compared to 2022. As a management team, we pride ourselves on the following: first, owning our realities, whatever they are; next, making a big company small so we can adjust timely; and third, being disciplined in thought, resource allocation and execution, helping us to accomplish our mission. Once again, I believe our people have impressively demonstrated these traits in the face of new challenges and delivered positive outcomes for our patients, the communities we serve and our other stakeholders. I often refer to them as can do people. And again, this past year, I think they proved it. I want to thank them for their hard work and everything they do for our company. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong in the fourth quarter. Admissions grew 3% year-over-year. Equivalent admissions were up 4%, emergency room visits grew 2%. Inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes increased approximately 1%. Most of our other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and rehab admissions had solid growth metrics in the quarter also. All domestic divisions had equivalent admissions growth in the quarter. Additionally, payer mix and acuity levels in the quarter improved year-over-year. These factors, along with certain enhancements in a couple of states' Medicaid supplemental programs helped produce same facilities revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Bill will provide more detail on revenue in his comments. Operating margins improved in the quarter as we were able to generate solid operating leverage across the company on the increased revenue we produced as compared to the prior year, but even more impressively when compared sequentially to the third quarter. We executed well over the year on our people agenda. In the quarter, we saw further progress on key metrics as evidenced by solid employee engagement results, stable turnover trends and reductions in contract labor utilization. As we have detailed in the past, we have implemented a comprehensive human resources plan. We expect to make further progress on it as we move into 2024. Our plan will remain a top organizational priority with significant investments in workforce development and trainings, which includes expansions in both Galen College of Nursing and our centers for clinical advancement. With respect to hospital-based physician costs in the quarter, we slowed the rate of growth. As it pertains to Valesco, our physician staffing joint venture, we reduced the operating loss in the fourth quarter, more in line with our expectations. As indicated at our Investor Day, we expect to invest significantly this year in our long-term plans, which we designed to take our company from strength to strength and achieve the growth potential we see in our core business. These investments revolve around three distinct opportunities. The first one includes continued network expansion in facilities, services and workforce to meet the demand growth that we expect in our markets while also supporting our efforts to increase market share. In 2024, we have over $2 billion of new capital projects scheduled to come online that will increase capacities. Additionally, we expect to integrate a number of newly acquired hospitals and outpatient facilities that should complement our networks. The second opportunity includes a robust agenda designed to advance digital capabilities across the company and unlock the embedded value we see in our operations. As high performing as we are today, we believe there is more operational potential inside our company with evolving technological tools we are investing to unlock this value. We believe this initiative, together with our care transformation and innovation program will enhance quality, drive further efficiencies through our financial resiliency program and improve overall operational management capabilities, including integrating our revenue cycle and case management functions better. The third area of opportunity pertains to the flexibility we have to use our balance sheet position and strong cash flow production to invest heavily in our business and in our people while also allocating capital to our shareholders. In 2024, we plan to increase capital spending to over $5 billion and enhance our share repurchase program to around $5 billion. We continue to believe this strategic plan will produce more winning play for our organization, allowing us to deliver better services for patients while also creating value for other stakeholders. Let me close with this, the constants in our organization consists of three principles: giving our patients what they deserve whenever they need services, partnering with our physicians to deliver high-quality outcomes and leveraging the distinct elements of HCA Healthcare to improve performance. Our approach to delivering on these core values comes from what we term the HCA way. That is supporting our local provider systems with value-added enterprise-level capabilities coupled with disciplined and detailed oriented management teams that relentlessly focus on execution. This operating philosophy has helped us navigate different economic cycles, adapt to changes in the industry and address challenges such as the COVID pandemic. As we look to the future, we have designed our next-generation growth plan to build upon the strengths we have developed over the years and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. I am proud of HCA Healthcare and I'm even more proud of our people. We will move into 2024 in the years ahead with greater purpose with a renewed agenda to drive sustained growth and with confidence in our ability to deliver value and positive outcomes for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call to Bill, and he will discuss in more detail the quarter's results and 2024 guidance.\nBill Rutherford: Okay, great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter and year and then discuss our 2024 guidance. We highlighted at our recent Investor Day that our formula of combining strong operational performance with a disciplined and balanced allocation of capital has a long track record of generating value over time. Our results for 2023 and our guidance for 2024 reflect a continuation of this formula. Sam provided many of our fourth quarter indicators in his comments. So let me take a moment to review some of our results for the full year 2023. We have strong top line growth. For the year, our same facility admissions grew 3.3% over prior year, equivalent admissions grew 4.8%, emergency room business grew 4.7% and total surgical cases were up 2.3%. We maintained our strong acuity trends with case mix index increasing and payer mix improved with managed care and other admissions growing 6% for the full year on a same-facility basis. Revenue per equivalent admission grew 2.7% on a same facility basis. This contributed to same-facility revenue growing 7.6% and 7.9% on a consolidated basis for the full year 2023. We coupled top line strength with strong management of operating costs. Salaries, wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points on a consolidated basis compared to prior year. Contract labor declined 20% for the year and equated to 5.3% of those SMEB in the fourth quarter. Our teams continue to do a great job managing the supply costs, which improved 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue for the full year. As we have mentioned throughout the year, we are managing through pressures on professional fees and hospital-based physician costs. But we saw an improvement in the sequential rate of growth in both the third and fourth quarter. Sam mentioned, we also saw an improvement in our Valesco joint venture, which was in line with our expectations. We are confident in our plans to continue working through what we believe are industry-wide pressures in this area. The result of this is we produced solid margins of 19.6% in line with our range of expectations on a consolidated basis and adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.5% on an as reported basis for the full year 2023. So as a management team, we are very pleased with the operational performance of the company during the year. Let me briefly discuss our results in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew just under 14% in the quarter as compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to strong revenue growth and solid expense management during the quarter. In addition to our strong core business trends, we recognized a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA increase of approximately $250 million related to our supplemental payment programs. This includes the new North Carolina program and certain favorable adjustments within the Texas program. Additionally, based on our experience with the program to date, we began accruing the Florida program in the quarter, whereas previously, we had recognized this program on an annual lump sum basis. Our recently acquired entities, as well as facilities divested in the prior year, resulted in about $90 million less adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, with roughly half of this decline from the Valesco joint venture. In summary, the quarter was the strongest operational performance of the year. And with the additional benefit from the supplemental programs and impact of new and divested facilities, we are very pleased with the year-over-year growth we were able to produce. So next let me speak to capital allocation. We deployed a balanced allocation of capital in 2023. For the full year, our cash flow from operations was $9.4 billion compared to $8.5 billion in the prior year or just under 11% growth. Capital expenditures were just above $4.7 billion for the year, which was in line with our expectations. We purchased approximately $3.8 billion of our outstanding shares and paid approximately $660 million of dividends during the year. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range of three to four times, so we believe we are well positioned going into 2024. And with that, let me speak to our 2024 guidance for a moment. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year 2024 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $67.75 billion and $70.25 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.85 billion and $13.55 billion. And expect diluted earnings per share to range between $19.70 and $21.20. And finally, we expect capital spending to range between $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion. So let me provide a little additional commentary on our guidance. First, let me note the $145 million payer settlement we reported in the first quarter of 2023. Our guidance assumes a growth in equivalent admissions between 3% and 4% and revenue per equivalent admission between 2% and 3%. Regarding state supplemental programs, I want to highlight that these programs are complex and most have multiple attributes that impact the timing and amounts we receive. So this results in some variability of the timing of recognizing the impact of these programs during the year. For 2024, we are anticipating benefit from a new program in Nevada. But based on current assumptions, we expect some modest headwinds when we aggregate the impact of all of these supplemental programs and we believe this could range between $100 million and $200 million for the year. We expect full year margins to be within our historical trends, and cash flow from operations to range between $9.5 billion and $10 billion. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3.2 billion. And interest expense is projected to be around $2 billion. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be around 264 million for the year. Also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. This will be in addition to the approximately $300 million remaining on our prior authorization. In addition, our Board declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.60 to $0.66 per share. With that, let me turn the call back over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: All right, thank you, Bill. As you saw in our press release, Bill Rutherford has decided to retire after 34 years with the company, 10 years as CFO, and Bill had a tremendous career with HCA. And then in my communication to our colleagues throughout the company I indicated that is impressive as the results were financially with the company during his tenure. Bill's legacy with the company will be remembered by the many people in the company has positively impacted with his leadership, mentorship and the way he embraced our mission and culture. And so Bill, congratulations on your retirement, and thank you very much on behalf of the Board and the senior team for everything you've done for the organization. Now part of Bill\u2019s legacy is creating a really deep financial team inside our organization. We pride ourselves on having the capabilities to build talent and then replace talent and we are fortunate to have Mike Marks as our next CFO. Mike has been with the company for 28 years. He has had various roles most of which were in the National Group as the Group\u2019s CFO for the National Group for 10 years, and then he has been in the Senior Vice President and Financial Operations role for the last few years. He is a proven HCA executive, he understands and appreciates our culture, he knows how to execute and get results and I know he's going to be an exceptional CFO for HCA. And I am eager for many of you to get to meet him. So Mike, congratulations. So with that Frank, we will go into questions.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Sam. And thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so we might give as many as possible in the queue, an opportunity to ask a question. Greg, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.\nOperator: All right, thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] Okay, it looks like our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Caller please go ahead. \nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Best wishes Bill, on the retirement and congratulations to Mike. I just want to ask about volumes because there is obviously some different chatter out there about what's going on. I think coming into the fourth quarter, you guys had said you expected to see a return to normal seasonality. I wonder whether that's what you described, what you saw there? Do you have any updated thoughts on whether we\u2019re seeing a sicker population post-COVID maybe just some pent-up demand for people going back to see the doctors? And then specifically as well on utilization review management, we've talked about that from time to time that health plans are getting more aggressive post-pandemic now about utilization review. There is also a chatter in the last week about maybe there is actually easing around observation status. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit of what you're seeing in that category as well.\nSam Hazen: Well, let's see, A.J., this is Sam, there is about four questions there. Let me see if I can sort of emphasize them. I will tell you from our judgment we had normal seasonality with respect to most categories of our business. And we had indicated last year that we thought seasonality trends have returned in the latter half of 2022 and they continued in our estimation into the latter half of 2023, with the natural seasonality that we see in our outpatient areas as well as some of our other surgical areas for the most part from the third quarter of this year to the fourth quarter. How that was influenced by new policies and pent-up demand, we can't really determine that, and we don't believe it had a material impact. So from our standpoint, we've been optimistic that our strategy around our network development, our execution on our quality and patient safety agenda, and then our partnerships with our physicians was going to allow us to continue to grow. We mentioned that at our Investor Day. And we think that's part and parcel to what's happening with our business as we push through the latter part of the year. I mean there is always utilization of policies and procedures coming from the payers. There is, like I said, some changes in certain policies. It's way too early judge the effect of those and we are really judging our business and thinking about 2024 optimistically around where the demand for health care is at least in our markets.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Caller, please go ahead.\nPito Chickering:\ns :\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Pito, let me put it this way, I can't give you all that detail right now. As we've talked about, we view supplemental payments is really just part of our overall Medicaid revenue portfolio. I think we're up to 17 or 18 states with supplemental payment programs right now. As I mentioned in my comments, each of these programs have a level of complexity and multiple attributes to it that affect the timing of when we recognize those. In the quarter, as I mentioned, we did recognize the benefit of the new North Carolina program that was anticipated. We had settlement in Texas, and we began accruing Florida accounts for it. So we can maybe offline give you a quarter-by-quarter breakdown. But those were the main things that affected us during the fourth quarter. But I will mention even with the supplemental payment programs, the core operations of the business remains strong. When we look at core revenue growth as well as our revenue per unit growth, we believe the supplemental payments were just additive to what was already a strong quarter.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks guys. And I will start off by adding my thanks to Bill, I appreciate all the help over the years, and you will be missed and congrats to Mike. My question was around Medicare specifically and a couple of things. One, you talked about commercial being strong. We've been hearing Medicare Advantage trends have been specifically really strong in the quarter. Can you give us some color on Medicare revenue growth and Medicare volume growth in the quarter? And then specifically, I think in reference to A.J.\u2019s question, I think we\u2019re just try to touch on was the impact of the two-midnight rule. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on there for 2024? And what you think the impact might be? And did you see any early benefits in 2023 as it started ramping up into this? Thanks a lot.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Justin, thanks for that. Let\u2019s start with the Medicare volume, as I know that\u2019s been a topic. We have seen some growth in our Medicare Advantage admissions, which were roughly up 10% in the quarter, which is pretty consistent for what we\u2019ve seen throughout the year. And we think probably a combination of conversion from traditional Medicare fee-for-service as well as some of our volume gains and maybe a bit utilization. It\u2019s hard for us to break that down in its entirety on there in terms of our revenue per unit between Medicare Advantage and Medicare has been very consistent through the year as well. So we didn\u2019t see any really step change in the fourth quarter of that material amount. When I think about the two-midnight rule Sam alluded it\u2019s too early for us to judge the impact of this rule. We know it\u2019s got a period to be implemented. We believe ultimately it\u2019s going to benefit our patients. And we think over time could be some moderate positive results for us, but we\u2019ve seen no impact yet. But we believe over time, as we go through 2024, there could be some modest benefits we\u2019ll go through that.\nOperator: Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Ben, go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Hey, thank you very much, and congratulations to Bill and Mike. Just wanted to follow-up on your comment about the $5 billion of capital spending you expect. Just wanted to get an idea of how you\u2019re thinking about allocating that into your inpatient capabilities and higher acuity. And where you think \u2013 where do you think \u2013 how should we think about that evolving through the year and the impact on case mix as we look into your 2024 guidance? Thank you.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. We have been pretty consistent with our allocation over the years between inpatient, outpatient and technology, and I think 2024 will be somewhat consistent with that. I will tell you we do have a large development pipeline of new outpatient facilities that are connected to our capital project in 2024 and 2025. We\u2019ll have quite a few come online, little bit more than we had in 2023 and 2022. We do have some new hospitals in a few markets that will come online, and we\u2019re starting to invest in, in other markets. So I think when we look at the volume of beds and so forth coming on in 2024, it\u2019s about the same as 2023, if I remember correctly. And then our ER capacity is growing consistently. So we\u2019re pretty consistent in our allocation of capital. It\u2019s not disproportionately oriented to any one category of our business. And we think, again, that approach has yielded really strong returns. It\u2019s allowed us to meet the demand expectations that exist in the market, and it\u2019s also responded to our physicians in a way that created the capacity or allowed for the clinical technology that they need to practice their medicine. So we\u2019re stepping it up because we have a growing occupancy on the inpatient side, and then we have opportunities in the outpatient side to expand our networks further in these fast growing communities. That\u2019s pretty much the snapshot of it, but it\u2019s generally consistent from an allocation standpoint to prior years.\nOperator: Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with TD Cowen. Gary, please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. One clarification and then I\u2019ll ask my real question. I just want to make sure I understood what Bill said, and congrats to Bill, by the way.\nBill Rutherford: Thanks.\nGary Taylor: You were walking through the net Medicaid, DPP, EBITDA, outlook for 2024. And I think you said overall you\u2019re expecting that dollars to come down $100 million to $200 million. I want to make sure I heard that correct. And then my real question was just, you talked about stemming the Valesco operating losses sequentially to more in line with what you originally thought, which I think means maybe brings that down to sort of breakeven in the quarter. And I was just hoping you\u2019d share with us a little bit about how operationally you pulled that off.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Gary, this is Bill. Thanks for those comments. Let\u2019s start with DPP. You are correct in my comments. We are expecting overall, when we aggregate all the programs to potentially be a headwind, anywhere between $100 million and $200 million, largely due to settlements that we received this year, we don\u2019t expect to reoccur. And then the Florida beginning accrual had an impact to that. So that\u2019s what\u2019s mostly driving that across our multiple programs. On Valesco, as we mentioned, it came in line with our expectations, which I think last quarter we sized just under $50 million or so a quarter. As we continue to work on multiple improvement initiatives, including further integrating that joint venture into HCA, we expect to see continued improvement going forward. Next year I think Valesco for the full year will equate with about the same amount we recorded this year, but we had nine months this year versus 12 months, obviously in 2024. So we do believe over time there will be continued improvement, and we\u2019re working diligently towards those efforts.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian, please go ahead.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, and Bill, congrats and very successful career at HCA. I guess my question to follow-up on Gary\u2019s, maybe expanding it further to the broader labor outlook. How are you thinking about the opportunity to further reduce spending on both nursing and obviously at Valesco? Or maybe another way to ask it is how are you viewing inflation at the wage level? Thank you.\nBill Rutherford: Well, I think we\u2019ve proven the teams have managed through that very well during the inflationary period we experienced. I think going forward we expect to move back into kind of the normal trends, which is generally 2.5% to 3% of wage inflation going for us. And then we believe there\u2019s continued improvement in contract labor to be achieved, and we have plans to execute that throughout 2024. On the professional fees in Valesco, we have a number of initiatives with teams working on that to not only further integrate into our operations, but to continue to figure out adjustments to those programs. Our professional fees I\u2019ve talked to, we have seen a decline in the sequential rate of growth. So we\u2019re a bit encouraged with that as we go into 2024. We would expect those sequential declines to continue. And we\u2019re working hard through multiple initiatives, whether it would be revenue enhancements, program adjustments, or looking at opportunities to internalize some of those programs.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Ann, please go ahead.\nAnn Hynes: Good morning. Thank you. And I also want to congratulate Bill on his retirement. I just have a couple of follow-ups just on the managed care pricing yield assumptions for 2024, which is up 2% to 3%, which looks a little conservative given the two-midnight rule. And when you look at Medicaid redeterminations, the growth in the health exchange in your states are very strong. So in your guidance, do you embed any benefit from the two-midnight rule or kind of the shift from Medicaid potentially to commercial? And then secondly, if you can just maybe give us some more detail about how the two-midnight rule could impact you, maybe a percent of emissions or maybe kind of a differential between revenue per emit would be great. Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Ann, this is Bill. Let me first clarify our 2% to 3% emission our aggregated revenue per equivalent emission, and then obviously there\u2019s categories underneath it. I would tell you regarding Medicaid redetermination still early. We believe there\u2019s some modest benefit that we\u2019ve seen as patients have migrated from Medicaid into Hicks [ph] and other employer sponsor. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s material yet. We\u2019ll see how that continues to trend throughout 2024. And I would say we don\u2019t have a material fact \u2013 material amount factored into our guidance on that. On the two-midnight rule, as we said earlier, it is really early in that progression. It should be positive for us if it\u2019s implemented as expected. I think it will be positive for patients over time as well, and we\u2019ll just have to see how that plays out. But we don\u2019t have, I\u2019d say, a material adjustment factored into our 2024 numbers for that as well. Our range of guidance, I think accommodates for various outcomes on both of those programs, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out as we go through the first part of the year.\nOperator: Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners. Whit, please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: Thanks, and congrats to Bill. I think this might be the second time you\u2019ve retired, so I hope it sticks. But my question really, Sam is I\u2019m curious on any new expense initiatives that you guys have elevated internally as a new strategic focus, anything maybe more creative or imaginative that you\u2019re bringing forth this year to challenge the organization? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Well, at our Investor Day, Mike Marks presented our financial resiliency program, and it\u2019s got different components to it. There\u2019s more sophisticated integration of our revenue cycle that includes our case management initiative, which I will highlight here. Our case management initiative is to make sure that our patients get into the right setting in the right timeline and free up capacity where appropriate, and so forth. This past year, we had early stage success with that. Our length of stay was down and our case mix was modestly up. So when you put the two together, it's a good start for us with respect to our case management initiative. That is important on multiple fronts. It allows us to allocate our nurse staffing more effectively to more acute patients and so forth. We will continue to invest in that initiative as we bring on more technology, more structure to our teams, and better process and benchmarking. The second thing I would highlight is with respect to what we're calling our internal benchmarking initiative, we have incredible opportunities to compare more deeply into our organization, whether it's on the variable cost side, with respect to what we allocate and distribute to our facilities or on fixed costs. And both of those categories are getting a lot more benchmarking under Mike's leadership and we're finding opportunities to rethink how we organize our cost structure, how we leverage process improvement, how we use technology and automation in those areas to improve processes and variable costs. So I'm excited about the prospects there. As I mentioned in my commentary, we had a very successful transition from the third quarter to the fourth quarter with respect to what we call clearance, operating leverage. And our operating leverage from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was the best I'd seen in my experiences with the company. And I think part of that, not all of that, is due to some of these initiatives and the transparency we have around our efforts to improve efficiencies, improve clinical outcomes for our patients and so forth. So those are two things I would highlight. Obviously, our technology agenda and our care transformation is a longer run effort with respect to improved outcomes across different dimensions of our business. And we've had some modest success there in the short run, but we're really banking on those programs giving us long-term value. So those are just a couple of highlights.  Whit, I will tell you, our teams, culturally, are disciplined, and as I mentioned, that discipline creates opportunities for us to find better ways to do things for all of our stakeholders. And that mindset is something that we carry forward from one year to the next, and we'll carry that on into 2024, on into 2025 and so forth. And we think it's an essential ingredient for a health system success. And I'm pretty proud of our teams and how they embrace that and how they execute on the initiatives to make that happen.\nOperator: Thanks, Whit. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin, please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. And I'll just add my thanks to Bill for your help over the years. I guess, wanted to know, I get a little more color from you guys about the volume expectation for 2024, because you guys know we talk about two to three. It looks like you're looking for faster growth in 2024. So I just wanted to better understand where that extra growth is coming from. So any color around the service lines or procedures that you think still have room to grow above average. And if there's anything that you expect from a payer mix perspective in 2024, is there one type of payer where you think there's a big opportunity for volumes to snap back? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Kevin, let me start and then Sam can add in. So we're going off our experience, we've seen throughout 2023. And as we said earlier in the comments, we thought there was very strong demand for services in our markets. We think our capital programs and our program initiatives are paying off. Our adjusted emissions this year were 4.8%. You're right. Our guidance next year calls us for three to four expectation on adjusted emissions. That may be a little higher than our two to three historical, but I think we're reading continued strong demand. We saw really strong enrollment in the health insurance exchanges across our states, and that continues to be a favorable development for us. We believe we continue to see strong economic indicators and employments and our access to contract and lives remain well. So I think all of those factors go into play with our expectations for 2024 and is based on kind of our current experience.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Stephen, please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thanks. And congrats to Bill as well. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about surgical growth in the quarter, whether there's any notable puts or takes there by service line or inpatient versus outpatient. And then I guess the overall growth slowed down a little bit as we got to the back half of the year. I guess, how are you thinking about surgical growth in 2024 and especially coming up against maybe some of the tougher comparisons that you'll have in the first half of the year? Thank you.\nBill Rutherford: So overall, the fourth quarter surgery was a little slower than the year-to-date, and we were talking about that earlier this morning, we did have a more difficult December calendar, even though, we had the same surgical days in total. The way they were allocated created some challenges in our outpatient settings. And we saw outpatient activity not as strong as in the previous two months of the quarter, but at a structural level, there's nothing to suggest that our surgical volume trends are going to change. For the year, we had really solid volume growth in surgeries, and we continue to invest heavily in our programs, both on the outpatient side and supporting our inpatient activity with more acute and complex program offerings. And for the year, our inpatient surgeries were up two and our outpatient surgeries were up 2.5. So a slight migration, if you will, into the outpatient setting. And we think that will be generally consistent as we push into 2024, we do have a number of ambulatory surgery centers that have opened or will open in 2024. We've made a few acquisitions in certain markets with ambulatory surgery centers, and we continue to invest in our hospital operating suites as well as improve our processes just as we are improving our emergency room processes with our revitalization program. And we think that will continue to be a value add for our patients and for our physicians and help us with our volume pursuits. So that's how we're judging the surgical space. If you look at cardiac underneath that, our cardiac volumes continue to grow very robust and are actually growing in the mid-single digits. And we think, again, that's reflective of our overall program development, expansion into new service lines underneath cardiac and responding again to our patient needs and physician needs in ways that we believe are productive for our organization.\nOperator: Excellent. Our next caller \u2013 excuse me. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi Group. Jason, please go ahead.\nJason Cassorla: Yes, great. Thanks for taking my question and best of luck in your retirement, Bill. I just wanted to follow-up on the professional fee environment. You noted there was some deceleration in professional fee spent growth, if I heard that correctly. But maybe what is your expectation for physician costs or professional fees growth embedded within 2024 guidance. And then on Valesco, it sounds like from your comments, Bill, that Valesco would generate $150 million of negative EBITDA next year versus the $200 million or so headwind for 2023. Is that a fair way to look at it or any other color that would be great? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Let me add in and thanks for that. I think Valesco is a little lower. We're about $150 million of both years, but obviously in 2023, we add a nine months versus 12 months next year. So we see a kind of run rate improvement as we go through the quarters during the year. On pro fees, we, as we said, have seen a decline in the sequential rate of growth. We have multiple initiatives underway embedded in our guidance next year is holding that professional fee growth perhaps to 8% to 10% versus this year where it's been closer to 15% to 20%. So we are looking for a step change and we're confident in our initiatives and the activities we have to be able to begin to bend that trend line.\nOperator: Great. Thanks, Jason. And our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott, please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. And I'll echo my congrats to Bill. And then my question is, would be curious in terms of how you're thinking about the whole broader debate on just the pent up demand recovery in the seniors population. And based on all your data and analysis, sort of where you think the Medicare utilization trends are now at this point relative to sort of pre-pandemic levels and returning to the baseline, certainly, felt like there was some quite a bit of that recovery played out in 2023, but interested in sort of what inning you think we may be in that process at this point. Thanks.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. It's interesting. I'm just looking at a trend line here, and I don't have it beyond this time period. But in 2019, this is a composite view of Medicare. So it has both Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Our Medicare admissions grew 2.6%. You throw out 2020 and 2021 grew 2.1%, 2022 grew 3.4% and 2023 grew 4%. So is there acceleration on our trend? Yes. Obviously, there's aging baby boomers in the mix there, number one. Number two, we think we're taking out market share, so to judge overall utilization patterns around that is really difficult for us. There's population growth in our markets. When you look at adjusted admissions on the same combination payer class, again: 3.7% in 2019, 5.3% at 2021, 4.7% in 2022 and 5.7% in 2023. So a slight acceleration, but a function we believe of aging baby boomers and a number of beneficiaries moving in the program, population growth for us in market share gains. So it's hard for us to judge underneath that, whether or not there's some structural change in utilization, that's almost impossible for us to discern with the data that we have.\nOperator: Great. Thank you, Scott. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Sarah, please go ahead.\nSarah James: Congratulations on the retirement, Bill.\nBill Rutherford: Thanks.\nSarah James: You guys said that the impact of the two-midnight rule ramps through the year. So it ramp as opposed to flipping a switch, what are the mechanics of that stage implementation? Is it retaining your staff? Or is it assuming some delay in benefit from claims denials and getting the payers on board? And then when would it be fully ramped? Are you talking midyear exiting 2024? And is there anything that HCA can do to pull that forward?\nBill Rutherford: Well, I mean, the rule goes in effect in January. So I think the impact may ramp over time. It's a notable change for the payers. So we're working them very closely on the administration of those plans and making sure it's operating as described on there. And if it does, we should see it equally throughout the year. And so we're working closely on it, but it's a pretty big change for the payers. And so there might be some administrative differences as it gets implemented through the year. But we hope very quickly, we'll be able to work our way through that and begin to see some benefit as we go through 2024.\nOperator: Thanks, Sarah. And our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Lance, please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Great and congratulations to both Bill and Mike. Can you talk a little bit about labor supply that you're seeing? First, in the past a couple of quarters ago, I talked about like demand that have been turned away at the hospitals; if you could just note if there's still any of that? And then how kind of hiring pipelines and are there particular areas that are more plentiful or areas that might be bottlenecks? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam again. Thank you for the question. We finished the year roughly. I don't have the exact average here at 90% acceptance rate. In other words we weren't able to take roughly 10% of the patients who were referred to us through our transfer centers and such. That improved throughout the year as we went from maybe the mid- to high- in the first part of the year, to a little better than that in the second half of the year. We're still below where we were in 2019. But what we have seen is more patients coming through our transfer centers and other patient navigation program that we did in 2019. So we feel good about the inflow if you will. We are still at times in situations where all of our capacity is not open and available, and that's what generates these situations where we can't receive the patients that are coming through these navigation programs and transfer centers. We think that will continue to get better in 2024 as we have capital coming online, as our hiring patterns continue to improve. Our turnover as I mentioned in my commentary has also improved. We've been very intentional in trying to create a great environment for our people with good leadership; resource capabilities and just overall trading to support the efforts so that they can be successful in what they do. And we think that will help us push through 2024 and hopefully have more capacity available and be able to receive the patients that want to get into our system.\nOperator: Great. Thanks, Lance. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Josh, please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'll thank Bill and congratulate him on the retirement, and congrats to Mike as well. Could you speak to the increase in CapEx guidance again, this has been a multiyear trend for guidance? And maybe how returns on CapEx have trended? I'm just curious if there's more mix to outpatient, is that actually improving returns or are you getting to a point where the returns are coming in a little bit lower for the incremental project as you sort of continue to go down the list? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Josh, this is Bill. I'll start on the returns. Our returns remain very solid. I mean, we're in the upper teens returns. We have a very disciplined process where we evaluate these projects and we actually do look backs to validate some of our assumptions. And to me the growth in the capital spending is a reflection of the growth of the opportunities we see to deploy capital to continue that growth. So we're very pleased with the returns on those. I think as Sam mentioned earlier in the Q&A, the mix between inpatient and outpatient, it varies from time to time, but mostly similar. We do have some newer outpatient facilities coming on. They generally have very good returns and quick returns when they do come online. So I think the capital program, we're pleased with; it's an important component to our growth formula, as we've talked about, and we're pleased with the overall returns in the interview.\nSam Hazen: Yes. And the only thing I would say, and Bill alluded to this, our outpatient platform tends to be short cycle returns. We get a real efficient sort of capital allocation with outpatient facilities. And then on the hospital side, we are a hospital-centric health system. And as we invest in our hospitals, those are long-lived assets and they have a longer cycle to them with respect to returns, but they're critically important to the overall value that our outpatient facilities can generate for our system in the sense that we're able to navigate the patient further into the health care system if they need more acute care offerings. So we have to look at it in both manners. I think to Bill's point, we have had strong returns, a pattern of strong returns, we have occupancy on our inpatient hospital side in the low-70% which is a pretty high occupancy level up over where it was pre-pandemic even with the additional beds that we've added. So we think the network model that we highlighted for you all at the Investor Day is working and is complemented by the outpatient facilities integrated with the hospital system in a manner that produces really positive enterprise returns for our company.\nOperator: Great. Thanks, Josh. And our final question comes from the line of Cal Sternick with JPMorgan. Cal, please go ahead.\nCal Sternick: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in, and I'll add my congratulations to Bill as well. So two follow-ups. First, on the redeterminations, it sounds like that's a slight benefit to the 2024 guide but not really material yet. Just wanted to clarify if this does develop better than you're anticipating? Is it something you think could be material to 2024? Or is the upside more annualized in 2025 after the redeterminations are completed? And then my other question was on the quarter itself. So one of the payers called out higher COVID inpatient costs per case. Can you talk about the COVID acuity levels that you saw in the quarter and whether that developed consistently with what you've seen in the past?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. Let me start with the Medicaid redetermination. I think you're characteristic is right, we do see some modest benefit in 2024. We haven't adjusted to be material yet, but our range of guidance allows for some outcomes on there. We started to see some of the effects of those redeterminations late in 2023. We're tracking those very closely. We're seeing roughly 30% to 35% of those individuals that were potentially on Medicaid seem to show up with either HICS or employer-sponsored coverage, so that there's some benefit in that. We're seeing a decently large number being able to be reapplied into Medicaid because some were redetermined off for technical reasons. So we've been able to manage through that. And I think with the conversion into HICS or employer-sponsored, there is some modest benefit as we go through the year. And potentially, that will continue as we go through 2024. But don't judge that to be material at this stage. Regarding COVID, to be honest with you, we haven't \u2013 COVID is really been stable for us over the past year. In total, our COVID admissions are roughly 2% of our total admissions. I don't really have any data on acuity, but I think it's very, very stable and hasn't really been a material factor in our overall operating results of late.\nOperator: Great. Thanks, all. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it over to Frank for closing remarks. Frank, the floor is yours.\nFrank Morgan: Sure. Great. Thank you for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. Hope you have a wonderful week, and we'll be around this afternoon and the balance of the week if we can answer any additional questions you might have. Have a good day.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Okay, great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter and year and then discuss our 2024 guidance. We highlighted at our recent Investor Day that our formula of combining strong operational performance with a disciplined and balanced allocation of capital has a long track record of generating value over time. Our results for 2023 and our guidance for 2024 reflect a continuation of this formula. Sam provided many of our fourth quarter indicators in his comments. So let me take a moment to review some of our results for the full year 2023. We have strong top line growth. For the year, our same facility admissions grew 3.3% over prior year, equivalent admissions grew 4.8%, emergency room business grew 4.7% and total surgical cases were up 2.3%. We maintained our strong acuity trends with case mix index increasing and payer mix improved with managed care and other admissions growing 6% for the full year on a same-facility basis. Revenue per equivalent admission grew 2.7% on a same facility basis. This contributed to same-facility revenue growing 7.6% and 7.9% on a consolidated basis for the full year 2023. We coupled top line strength with strong management of operating costs. Salaries, wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points on a consolidated basis compared to prior year. Contract labor declined 20% for the year and equated to 5.3% of those SMEB in the fourth quarter. Our teams continue to do a great job managing the supply costs, which improved 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue for the full year. As we have mentioned throughout the year, we are managing through pressures on professional fees and hospital-based physician costs. But we saw an improvement in the sequential rate of growth in both the third and fourth quarter. Sam mentioned, we also saw an improvement in our Valesco joint venture, which was in line with our expectations. We are confident in our plans to continue working through what we believe are industry-wide pressures in this area. The result of this is we produced solid margins of 19.6% in line with our range of expectations on a consolidated basis and adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.5% on an as reported basis for the full year 2023. So as a management team, we are very pleased with the operational performance of the company during the year. Let me briefly discuss our results in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew just under 14% in the quarter as compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to strong revenue growth and solid expense management during the quarter. In addition to our strong core business trends, we recognized a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA increase of approximately $250 million related to our supplemental payment programs. This includes the new North Carolina program and certain favorable adjustments within the Texas program. Additionally, based on our experience with the program to date, we began accruing the Florida program in the quarter, whereas previously, we had recognized this program on an annual lump sum basis. Our recently acquired entities, as well as facilities divested in the prior year, resulted in about $90 million less adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, with roughly half of this decline from the Valesco joint venture. In summary, the quarter was the strongest operational performance of the year. And with the additional benefit from the supplemental programs and impact of new and divested facilities, we are very pleased with the year-over-year growth we were able to produce. So next let me speak to capital allocation. We deployed a balanced allocation of capital in 2023. For the full year, our cash flow from operations was $9.4 billion compared to $8.5 billion in the prior year or just under 11% growth. Capital expenditures were just above $4.7 billion for the year, which was in line with our expectations. We purchased approximately $3.8 billion of our outstanding shares and paid approximately $660 million of dividends during the year. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range of three to four times, so we believe we are well positioned going into 2024. And with that, let me speak to our 2024 guidance for a moment. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year 2024 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $67.75 billion and $70.25 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.85 billion and $13.55 billion. And expect diluted earnings per share to range between $19.70 and $21.20. And finally, we expect capital spending to range between $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion. So let me provide a little additional commentary on our guidance. First, let me note the $145 million payer settlement we reported in the first quarter of 2023. Our guidance assumes a growth in equivalent admissions between 3% and 4% and revenue per equivalent admission between 2% and 3%. Regarding state supplemental programs, I want to highlight that these programs are complex and most have multiple attributes that impact the timing and amounts we receive. So this results in some variability of the timing of recognizing the impact of these programs during the year. For 2024, we are anticipating benefit from a new program in Nevada. But based on current assumptions, we expect some modest headwinds when we aggregate the impact of all of these supplemental programs and we believe this could range between $100 million and $200 million for the year. We expect full year margins to be within our historical trends, and cash flow from operations to range between $9.5 billion and $10 billion. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3.2 billion. And interest expense is projected to be around $2 billion. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be around 264 million for the year. Also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. This will be in addition to the approximately $300 million remaining on our prior authorization. In addition, our Board declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.60 to $0.66 per share. With that, let me turn the call back over to Sam. Yes. Justin, thanks for that. Let's start with the Medicare volume, as I know that's been a topic. We have seen some growth in our Medicare Advantage admissions, which were roughly up 10% in the quarter, which is pretty consistent for what we've seen throughout the year. And we think probably a combination of conversion from traditional Medicare fee-for-service as well as some of our volume gains and maybe a bit utilization. It's hard for us to break that down in its entirety on there in terms of our revenue per unit between Medicare Advantage and Medicare has been very consistent through the year as well. So we didn't see any really step change in the fourth quarter of that material amount. When I think about the two-midnight rule Sam alluded it's too early for us to judge the impact of this rule. We know it's got a period to be implemented. We believe ultimately it's going to benefit our patients. And we think over time could be some moderate positive results for us, but we've seen no impact yet. But we believe over time, as we go through 2024, there could be some modest benefits we'll go through that. Thanks. Yes. Gary, this is Bill. Thanks for those comments. Let's start with DPP. You are correct in my comments. We are expecting overall, when we aggregate all the programs to potentially be a headwind, anywhere between $100 million and $200 million, largely due to settlements that we received this year, we don't expect to reoccur. And then the Florida beginning accrual had an impact to that. So that's what's mostly driving that across our multiple programs. On Valesco, as we mentioned, it came in line with our expectations, which I think last quarter we sized just under $50 million or so a quarter. As we continue to work on multiple improvement initiatives, including further integrating that joint venture into HCA, we expect to see continued improvement going forward. Next year I think Valesco for the full year will equate with about the same amount we recorded this year, but we had nine months this year versus 12 months, obviously in 2024. So we do believe over time there will be continued improvement, and we're working diligently towards those efforts. Well, I think we've proven the teams have managed through that very well during the inflationary period we experienced. I think going forward we expect to move back into kind of the normal trends, which is generally 2.5% to 3% of wage inflation going for us. And then we believe there's continued improvement in contract labor to be achieved, and we have plans to execute that throughout 2024. On the professional fees in Valesco, we have a number of initiatives with teams working on that to not only further integrate into our operations, but to continue to figure out adjustments to those programs. Our professional fees I've talked to, we have seen a decline in the sequential rate of growth. So we're a bit encouraged with that as we go into 2024. We would expect those sequential declines to continue. And we're working hard through multiple initiatives, whether it would be revenue enhancements, program adjustments, or looking at opportunities to internalize some of those programs. Yes. Ann, this is Bill. Let me first clarify our 2% to 3% emission our aggregated revenue per equivalent emission, and then obviously there's categories underneath it. I would tell you regarding Medicaid redetermination still early. We believe there's some modest benefit that we've seen as patients have migrated from Medicaid into Hicks [ph] and other employer sponsor. I don't believe that's material yet. We'll see how that continues to trend throughout 2024. And I would say we don't have a material fact \u2013 material amount factored into our guidance on that. On the two-midnight rule, as we said earlier, it is really early in that progression. It should be positive for us if it's implemented as expected. I think it will be positive for patients over time as well, and we'll just have to see how that plays out. But we don't have, I'd say, a material adjustment factored into our 2024 numbers for that as well. Our range of guidance, I think accommodates for various outcomes on both of those programs, and we'll see how that plays out as we go through the first part of the year. Yes. Kevin, let me start and then Sam can add in. So we're going off our experience, we've seen throughout 2023. And as we said earlier in the comments, we thought there was very strong demand for services in our markets. We think our capital programs and our program initiatives are paying off. Our adjusted emissions this year were 4.8%. You're right. Our guidance next year calls us for three to four expectation on adjusted emissions. That may be a little higher than our two to three historical, but I think we're reading continued strong demand. We saw really strong enrollment in the health insurance exchanges across our states, and that continues to be a favorable development for us. We believe we continue to see strong economic indicators and employments and our access to contract and lives remain well. So I think all of those factors go into play with our expectations for 2024 and is based on kind of our current experience. So overall, the fourth quarter surgery was a little slower than the year-to-date, and we were talking about that earlier this morning, we did have a more difficult December calendar, even though, we had the same surgical days in total. The way they were allocated created some challenges in our outpatient settings. And we saw outpatient activity not as strong as in the previous two months of the quarter, but at a structural level, there's nothing to suggest that our surgical volume trends are going to change. For the year, we had really solid volume growth in surgeries, and we continue to invest heavily in our programs, both on the outpatient side and supporting our inpatient activity with more acute and complex program offerings. And for the year, our inpatient surgeries were up two and our outpatient surgeries were up 2.5. So a slight migration, if you will, into the outpatient setting. And we think that will be generally consistent as we push into 2024, we do have a number of ambulatory surgery centers that have opened or will open in 2024. We've made a few acquisitions in certain markets with ambulatory surgery centers, and we continue to invest in our hospital operating suites as well as improve our processes just as we are improving our emergency room processes with our revitalization program. And we think that will continue to be a value add for our patients and for our physicians and help us with our volume pursuits. So that's how we're judging the surgical space. If you look at cardiac underneath that, our cardiac volumes continue to grow very robust and are actually growing in the mid-single digits. And we think, again, that's reflective of our overall program development, expansion into new service lines underneath cardiac and responding again to our patient needs and physician needs in ways that we believe are productive for our organization. Yes. Let me add in and thanks for that. I think Valesco is a little lower. We're about $150 million of both years, but obviously in 2023, we add a nine months versus 12 months next year. So we see a kind of run rate improvement as we go through the quarters during the year. On pro fees, we, as we said, have seen a decline in the sequential rate of growth. We have multiple initiatives underway embedded in our guidance next year is holding that professional fee growth perhaps to 8% to 10% versus this year where it's been closer to 15% to 20%. So we are looking for a step change and we're confident in our initiatives and the activities we have to be able to begin to bend that trend line. Thanks. Well, I mean, the rule goes in effect in January. So I think the impact may ramp over time. It's a notable change for the payers. So we're working them very closely on the administration of those plans and making sure it's operating as described on there. And if it does, we should see it equally throughout the year. And so we're working closely on it, but it's a pretty big change for the payers. And so there might be some administrative differences as it gets implemented through the year. But we hope very quickly, we'll be able to work our way through that and begin to see some benefit as we go through 2024. Josh, this is Bill. I'll start on the returns. Our returns remain very solid. I mean, we're in the upper teens returns. We have a very disciplined process where we evaluate these projects and we actually do look backs to validate some of our assumptions. And to me the growth in the capital spending is a reflection of the growth of the opportunities we see to deploy capital to continue that growth. So we're very pleased with the returns on those. I think as Sam mentioned earlier in the Q&A, the mix between inpatient and outpatient, it varies from time to time, but mostly similar. We do have some newer outpatient facilities coming on. They generally have very good returns and quick returns when they do come online. So I think the capital program, we're pleased with; it's an important component to our growth formula, as we've talked about, and we're pleased with the overall returns in the interview. Yes. This is Bill. Let me start with the Medicaid redetermination. I think you're characteristic is right, we do see some modest benefit in 2024. We haven't adjusted to be material yet, but our range of guidance allows for some outcomes on there. We started to see some of the effects of those redeterminations late in 2023. We're tracking those very closely. We're seeing roughly 30% to 35% of those individuals that were potentially on Medicaid seem to show up with either HICS or employer-sponsored coverage, so that there's some benefit in that. We're seeing a decently large number being able to be reapplied into Medicaid because some were redetermined off for technical reasons. So we've been able to manage through that. And I think with the conversion into HICS or employer-sponsored, there is some modest benefit as we go through the year. And potentially, that will continue as we go through 2024. But don't judge that to be material at this stage. Regarding COVID, to be honest with you, we haven't \u2013 COVID is really been stable for us over the past year. In total, our COVID admissions are roughly 2% of our total admissions. I don't really have any data on acuity, but I think it's very, very stable and hasn't really been a material factor in our overall operating results of late."

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "All right. Good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining the call. We finished 2023 better than expected across most dimensions of our business. In the quarter, we experienced strong demand for services across our diversified portfolio of markets, facilities and service lines. This growth, coupled with improved cost trends drove solid financial performance in the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales were $5.90, which represented a 27% increase over prior year. We are encouraged by these results and believe the operational momentum we have created should position us well for 2024. As mentioned at our recent Investor Day, the staying power of HCA Healthcare was on display again throughout the year. Diluted earnings per share excluding gains and losses on sales and debt retirement for the year grew almost 13% as compared to 2022. As a management team, we pride ourselves on the following: first, owning our realities, whatever they are; next, making a big company small so we can adjust timely; and third, being disciplined in thought, resource allocation and execution, helping us to accomplish our mission. Once again, I believe our people have impressively demonstrated these traits in the face of new challenges and delivered positive outcomes for our patients, the communities we serve and our other stakeholders. I often refer to them as can do people. And again, this past year, I think they proved it. I want to thank them for their hard work and everything they do for our company. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong in the fourth quarter. Admissions grew 3% year-over-year. Equivalent admissions were up 4%, emergency room visits grew 2%. Inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes increased approximately 1%. Most of our other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and rehab admissions had solid growth metrics in the quarter also. All domestic divisions had equivalent admissions growth in the quarter. Additionally, payer mix and acuity levels in the quarter improved year-over-year. These factors, along with certain enhancements in a couple of states' Medicaid supplemental programs helped produce same facilities revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Bill will provide more detail on revenue in his comments. Operating margins improved in the quarter as we were able to generate solid operating leverage across the company on the increased revenue we produced as compared to the prior year, but even more impressively when compared sequentially to the third quarter. We executed well over the year on our people agenda. In the quarter, we saw further progress on key metrics as evidenced by solid employee engagement results, stable turnover trends and reductions in contract labor utilization. As we have detailed in the past, we have implemented a comprehensive human resources plan. We expect to make further progress on it as we move into 2024. Our plan will remain a top organizational priority with significant investments in workforce development and trainings, which includes expansions in both Galen College of Nursing and our centers for clinical advancement. With respect to hospital-based physician costs in the quarter, we slowed the rate of growth. As it pertains to Valesco, our physician staffing joint venture, we reduced the operating loss in the fourth quarter, more in line with our expectations. As indicated at our Investor Day, we expect to invest significantly this year in our long-term plans, which we designed to take our company from strength to strength and achieve the growth potential we see in our core business. These investments revolve around three distinct opportunities. The first one includes continued network expansion in facilities, services and workforce to meet the demand growth that we expect in our markets while also supporting our efforts to increase market share. In 2024, we have over $2 billion of new capital projects scheduled to come online that will increase capacities. Additionally, we expect to integrate a number of newly acquired hospitals and outpatient facilities that should complement our networks. The second opportunity includes a robust agenda designed to advance digital capabilities across the company and unlock the embedded value we see in our operations. As high performing as we are today, we believe there is more operational potential inside our company with evolving technological tools we are investing to unlock this value. We believe this initiative, together with our care transformation and innovation program will enhance quality, drive further efficiencies through our financial resiliency program and improve overall operational management capabilities, including integrating our revenue cycle and case management functions better. The third area of opportunity pertains to the flexibility we have to use our balance sheet position and strong cash flow production to invest heavily in our business and in our people while also allocating capital to our shareholders. In 2024, we plan to increase capital spending to over $5 billion and enhance our share repurchase program to around $5 billion. We continue to believe this strategic plan will produce more winning play for our organization, allowing us to deliver better services for patients while also creating value for other stakeholders. Let me close with this, the constants in our organization consists of three principles: giving our patients what they deserve whenever they need services, partnering with our physicians to deliver high-quality outcomes and leveraging the distinct elements of HCA Healthcare to improve performance. Our approach to delivering on these core values comes from what we term the HCA way. That is supporting our local provider systems with value-added enterprise-level capabilities coupled with disciplined and detailed oriented management teams that relentlessly focus on execution. This operating philosophy has helped us navigate different economic cycles, adapt to changes in the industry and address challenges such as the COVID pandemic. As we look to the future, we have designed our next-generation growth plan to build upon the strengths we have developed over the years and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. I am proud of HCA Healthcare and I'm even more proud of our people. We will move into 2024 in the years ahead with greater purpose with a renewed agenda to drive sustained growth and with confidence in our ability to deliver value and positive outcomes for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call to Bill, and he will discuss in more detail the quarter's results and 2024 guidance. All right, thank you, Bill. As you saw in our press release, Bill Rutherford has decided to retire after 34 years with the company, 10 years as CFO, and Bill had a tremendous career with HCA. And then in my communication to our colleagues throughout the company I indicated that is impressive as the results were financially with the company during his tenure. Bill's legacy with the company will be remembered by the many people in the company has positively impacted with his leadership, mentorship and the way he embraced our mission and culture. And so Bill, congratulations on your retirement, and thank you very much on behalf of the Board and the senior team for everything you've done for the organization. Now part of Bill's legacy is creating a really deep financial team inside our organization. We pride ourselves on having the capabilities to build talent and then replace talent and we are fortunate to have Mike Marks as our next CFO. Mike has been with the company for 28 years. He has had various roles most of which were in the National Group as the Group's CFO for the National Group for 10 years, and then he has been in the Senior Vice President and Financial Operations role for the last few years. He is a proven HCA executive, he understands and appreciates our culture, he knows how to execute and get results and I know he's going to be an exceptional CFO for HCA. And I am eager for many of you to get to meet him. So Mike, congratulations. So with that Frank, we will go into questions. Well, let's see, A.J., this is Sam, there is about four questions there. Let me see if I can sort of emphasize them. I will tell you from our judgment we had normal seasonality with respect to most categories of our business. And we had indicated last year that we thought seasonality trends have returned in the latter half of 2022 and they continued in our estimation into the latter half of 2023, with the natural seasonality that we see in our outpatient areas as well as some of our other surgical areas for the most part from the third quarter of this year to the fourth quarter. How that was influenced by new policies and pent-up demand, we can't really determine that, and we don't believe it had a material impact. So from our standpoint, we've been optimistic that our strategy around our network development, our execution on our quality and patient safety agenda, and then our partnerships with our physicians was going to allow us to continue to grow. We mentioned that at our Investor Day. And we think that's part and parcel to what's happening with our business as we push through the latter part of the year. I mean there is always utilization of policies and procedures coming from the payers. There is, like I said, some changes in certain policies. It's way too early judge the effect of those and we are really judging our business and thinking about 2024 optimistically around where the demand for health care is at least in our markets. This is Sam. We have been pretty consistent with our allocation over the years between inpatient, outpatient and technology, and I think 2024 will be somewhat consistent with that. I will tell you we do have a large development pipeline of new outpatient facilities that are connected to our capital project in 2024 and 2025. We'll have quite a few come online, little bit more than we had in 2023 and 2022. We do have some new hospitals in a few markets that will come online, and we're starting to invest in, in other markets. So I think when we look at the volume of beds and so forth coming on in 2024, it's about the same as 2023, if I remember correctly. And then our ER capacity is growing consistently. So we're pretty consistent in our allocation of capital. It's not disproportionately oriented to any one category of our business. And we think, again, that approach has yielded really strong returns. It's allowed us to meet the demand expectations that exist in the market, and it's also responded to our physicians in a way that created the capacity or allowed for the clinical technology that they need to practice their medicine. So we're stepping it up because we have a growing occupancy on the inpatient side, and then we have opportunities in the outpatient side to expand our networks further in these fast growing communities. That's pretty much the snapshot of it, but it's generally consistent from an allocation standpoint to prior years. Well, at our Investor Day, Mike Marks presented our financial resiliency program, and it's got different components to it. There's more sophisticated integration of our revenue cycle that includes our case management initiative, which I will highlight here. Our case management initiative is to make sure that our patients get into the right setting in the right timeline and free up capacity where appropriate, and so forth. This past year, we had early stage success with that. Our length of stay was down and our case mix was modestly up. So when you put the two together, it's a good start for us with respect to our case management initiative. That is important on multiple fronts. It allows us to allocate our nurse staffing more effectively to more acute patients and so forth. We will continue to invest in that initiative as we bring on more technology, more structure to our teams, and better process and benchmarking. The second thing I would highlight is with respect to what we're calling our internal benchmarking initiative, we have incredible opportunities to compare more deeply into our organization, whether it's on the variable cost side, with respect to what we allocate and distribute to our facilities or on fixed costs. And both of those categories are getting a lot more benchmarking under Mike's leadership and we're finding opportunities to rethink how we organize our cost structure, how we leverage process improvement, how we use technology and automation in those areas to improve processes and variable costs. So I'm excited about the prospects there. As I mentioned in my commentary, we had a very successful transition from the third quarter to the fourth quarter with respect to what we call clearance, operating leverage. And our operating leverage from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was the best I'd seen in my experiences with the company. And I think part of that, not all of that, is due to some of these initiatives and the transparency we have around our efforts to improve efficiencies, improve clinical outcomes for our patients and so forth. So those are two things I would highlight. Obviously, our technology agenda and our care transformation is a longer run effort with respect to improved outcomes across different dimensions of our business. And we've had some modest success there in the short run, but we're really banking on those programs giving us long-term value. So those are just a couple of highlights.  Whit, I will tell you, our teams, culturally, are disciplined, and as I mentioned, that discipline creates opportunities for us to find better ways to do things for all of our stakeholders. And that mindset is something that we carry forward from one year to the next, and we'll carry that on into 2024, on into 2025 and so forth. And we think it's an essential ingredient for a health system success. And I'm pretty proud of our teams and how they embrace that and how they execute on the initiatives to make that happen. This is Sam. It's interesting. I'm just looking at a trend line here, and I don't have it beyond this time period. But in 2019, this is a composite view of Medicare. So it has both Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Our Medicare admissions grew 2.6%. You throw out 2020 and 2021 grew 2.1%, 2022 grew 3.4% and 2023 grew 4%. So is there acceleration on our trend? Yes. Obviously, there's aging baby boomers in the mix there, number one. Number two, we think we're taking out market share, so to judge overall utilization patterns around that is really difficult for us. There's population growth in our markets. When you look at adjusted admissions on the same combination payer class, again: 3.7% in 2019, 5.3% at 2021, 4.7% in 2022 and 5.7% in 2023. So a slight acceleration, but a function we believe of aging baby boomers and a number of beneficiaries moving in the program, population growth for us in market share gains. So it's hard for us to judge underneath that, whether or not there's some structural change in utilization, that's almost impossible for us to discern with the data that we have. This is Sam again. Thank you for the question. We finished the year roughly. I don't have the exact average here at 90% acceptance rate. In other words we weren't able to take roughly 10% of the patients who were referred to us through our transfer centers and such. That improved throughout the year as we went from maybe the mid- to high- in the first part of the year, to a little better than that in the second half of the year. We're still below where we were in 2019. But what we have seen is more patients coming through our transfer centers and other patient navigation program that we did in 2019. So we feel good about the inflow if you will. We are still at times in situations where all of our capacity is not open and available, and that's what generates these situations where we can't receive the patients that are coming through these navigation programs and transfer centers. We think that will continue to get better in 2024 as we have capital coming online, as our hiring patterns continue to improve. Our turnover as I mentioned in my commentary has also improved. We've been very intentional in trying to create a great environment for our people with good leadership; resource capabilities and just overall trading to support the efforts so that they can be successful in what they do. And we think that will help us push through 2024 and hopefully have more capacity available and be able to receive the patients that want to get into our system. Yes. And the only thing I would say, and Bill alluded to this, our outpatient platform tends to be short cycle returns. We get a real efficient sort of capital allocation with outpatient facilities. And then on the hospital side, we are a hospital-centric health system. And as we invest in our hospitals, those are long-lived assets and they have a longer cycle to them with respect to returns, but they're critically important to the overall value that our outpatient facilities can generate for our system in the sense that we're able to navigate the patient further into the health care system if they need more acute care offerings. So we have to look at it in both manners. I think to Bill's point, we have had strong returns, a pattern of strong returns, we have occupancy on our inpatient hospital side in the low-70% which is a pretty high occupancy level up over where it was pre-pandemic even with the additional beds that we've added. So we think the network model that we highlighted for you all at the Investor Day is working and is complemented by the outpatient facilities integrated with the hospital system in a manner that produces really positive enterprise returns for our company."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: All right, good morning. Thank you for joining the call. The business fundamentals for the company were solid in the quarter with broad-based volume growth on a same facility basis across our footprint and various service lines. These results reflected continued strong demand for our services and healthy operating margins on a same facility basis. Across most areas of our business, we maintained the operational momentum that we experienced over the past three quarters, including continued progress with our labor agenda. Unfortunately, our results were unfavorably impacted by our Valesco hospital-based physician venture. Bill will give additional detail on this impact in a moment.  We are continuing our efforts to integrate this venture and anticipate implementing additional actions that should improve its operational results over the next few quarters, including less pressure for the company in the fourth quarter. Because of this issue primarily, we have lowered the top side of our earnings guidance for the year to reflect the effects of these losses.  It is important to understand that we believe the decision to consolidate Valesco was strategically imperative in maintaining the overall competitive positioning and capacity offerings of the company. As has been the case historically with our teams, I am confident that we will find a pathway forward to mitigate the impact it has had on our results. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share were $3.91. Same facility admissions grew 3.4% year-over-year. Inpatient volumes were supported by continued strong acuity and a favorable payer mix with same facility commercial admissions growing an impressive 7%.  Same facility equivalent admissions increased 4.1%. This growth was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 3.5%. We are encouraged by our ER revitalization program and the results it is producing for our patients.  Outpatient surgeries on a same facility basis grew approximately 1% year-over-year. Other outpatient categories also grew, including outpatient cardiology procedures, which increased almost 5%. These factors contributed to an increase in same facility revenue of 7.9% as compared to the prior year.  In the quarter, we continue to invest significantly in our people with additional investments in orientation programs, Galen College of Nursing, and clinical education facilities. Turnover was stable in the quarter and nurse hiring was the strongest it has been all year. These positive results help reduce contract labor costs 12.5% as compared to the third quarter last year and 11% sequentially.  During the quarter we maintained available bed capacity. Instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals represented only 0.9% of total admissions, which is consistent with the rate in the second quarter.  We believe the significant investments we are making in our networks, our people, and our technology agenda will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our service offerings and deliver higher quality care to our patients with greater accessibility.  I'm proud of our people for what they do every day to deliver on our purpose. I want to thank them for their dedication and their overall great work. HCA Healthcare has a disciplined operating culture that we will maintain into the future. This focused approach, which benefits all stakeholders, enhances our ability to execute clinically, strategically and financially.  So let me close with this. We look forward to our upcoming Investor Day on November 9th when we will provide more details about the company's approach to driving sustained long-term growth and shareholder value. We will also provide some early perspectives on the upcoming year as well as longer-term thinking on growth targets.  With that, I will turn the call to Bill for more details on the quarter's results. \nBill Rutherford : Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Consolidated net revenue increased 8.3% to $16.21 billion from $14.97 billion in the prior year period. This was driven by 4.5% growth in equivalent admission and 3.6% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. Same facility revenues grew 7.9%.  As Sam mentioned in his comments, the Valesco joint venture had a negative impact of approximately $100 million on the company's adjusted EBITDA in the quarter as well on a year-to-date basis.  A portion of the third quarter results was due to revising our revenue estimates from the second quarter as we began to see claims being paid. This result was not what we were expecting, as we are experiencing revenue shortfalls compared to what we originally modeled.  The Valesco operating results had a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 80 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Going forward, we anticipate the loss from this venture to approximate $50 million a quarter.  We are working diligently on multiple efforts to address these results, including making programming adjustments where necessary, deploying efforts to reduce the cost structure, and working with payers for more appropriate reimbursement.  As we have discussed previously, we have seen subsidy requests increase from contracted hospital-based providers. Professional fee expense for contracted providers have grown approximately 20% on a year-to-date basis, although we are encouraged the rate of growth of these payments slowed in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter.  In addition to the mitigation strategies discussed above, we continue to assess other operational adjustments within our cost resiliency programs to help offset some of the impact from these issues. Let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics. Our cash flow from operations was $2.48 billion in the quarter. Capital spending was $1.15 billion. We paid about $160 million of dividends and repurchased $1.14 billion of our stock during the quarter. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated range of 3x to 4x.  As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2023 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $63.5 billion and $64.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.94 billion and $5.13 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.3 and $12.6 billion, and diluted earnings per share to range between $17.80 and $18.50. We expect capital spending to approximate $4.7 billion for the year.  Before we open it up for questions, I'd like to provide some commentary on our year-to-date performance. We believe our core business metrics remain solid. Year-to-date, our same facility emissions have grown 3.3%. Equivalent emissions have grown 5.1%. Non-COVID admissions have grown 7.5% over prior year on a year-to-date basis.  Same facility ER visits have grown 5.7%. Inpatient surgeries have grown 2.3%, and outpatient surgeries are up 3.1%, all on a year-to-date basis. These volume metrics have outpaced our original expectations going into the year.  Our payer mix trends remain favorable. Same facility managed care admissions increasing 5.3%, and Medicare admissions increasing 4.3% on a year-to-date basis. Medicaid and uninsured admissions are slightly down from the prior year on a year-to-date basis. Our case mix index has held and increased slightly over prior year, and our same facility revenues have increased 6.4% on a year-to-date basis.  Our same facility labor costs and supply costs are below prior year as a percentage of revenue. Through a focused and diligent effort, our operating teams have done an incredible job of addressing the contract labor pressures we had last year. On a year-to-date basis, our contract labor expense is down 18% or over 300 million from the prior year. We have confidence that a similar focused and diligent effort will help address the current physician cost pressures over time.  Lastly, when we look at our current adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2023, we think there are several notable items to consider. We discussed in our year-end call in January, COVID support payments, the out-of-period Texas waiver payment, and the 340B impact from 2022, which all totaled approximately $500 million. And when you consider the $145 million payer settlement we recorded in the first quarter of this year, as we take all of that into account, we are pleased with the growth rate we've been able to achieve.  In addition, our diluted earnings per share, excluding losses on sale of facilities and losses on retirement of debt has grown 7.2% year-to-date. So I wanted to take a moment to put this quarter in some perspective. So with that, we look forward to your questions and I'll turn the call over to Frank to open it up. \nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question, so that we might get as many as possible in the queue, an opportunity to ask a question.  Brianna, you may now give instructions to those who'd like to ask a question. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. \nKevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Maybe just want to build on that last point there. You know, the commentary about the year-to-date performance being strong is well taken, but I guess I get a lot of questions about whether there's anything unusual, I guess, in the performance this year. I think people are trying to figure out whether this is a good base to think about future growth or whether there's anything \u2013 whether it's in the volumes or the rate or the payer mix that we really shouldn't be expecting to continue. So I guess, is this a good base and should we think about normal growth off of this? Thanks.\nSam Hazen : Kevin, this is Sam. It\u2019s our belief that demand for healthcare remains strong and will remain strong into the future. Just given the population trends that we see in our market, the aging of the baby boomers, as well as chronic conditions.  I know though there's been a lot of concern about GLP-1 and so forth. We think it's way too early for any of that to have an impact on demand in the near term or even the intermediate term. And so from that standpoint, we're really encouraged by what we see from a demand standpoint.  Our overall competitive positioning, we believe continues to be strong. It's indicated within our market share trends vis-a-vis where we were pre-pandemic, and so we're encouraged by that. We continue to have resources we believe, to continue investing in our company appropriately, and positioning our agenda with the necessary resources to accomplish our objectives.  And so from our standpoint, economies remain strong across our portfolio, and we believe that supports some of the payer mix trends that we've seen. So we're reasonably optimistic here that the overall top line metrics that you are seeing have durability. \nOperator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. You're line is open. \nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Obviously, as you went through, strong results, obviously the focus on this professional fee challenge. I know coming out of the second quarter, you were I think, thinking it would step down in Q3 and Q4. Now it sounds like if anything, it probably stepped up a little bit.  I'm trying to understand, what was the variance in the quarter relative to previous expectations? Was it $50 million? It sounds like even in the quarter there's some catch up from Q2. So maybe it's a significantly bigger number as a negative. And then is the right way to think about Q4 and into next year, a $50 million quarterly run rate that you're assuming discontinues, and therefore you've got to pick up in \u201824, one more $50 million adverse comparison. Hopefully that makes sense.  And if I could squeeze in, just thinking about this quarter, the DPP payment from Florida, was that in line with what you thought or was that the net benefit a little better? \nBill Rutherford : Yes, A.J., this is Bill. Let me try to take those. So let's talk about Valesco first and isolate that from our pro fees. I would tell you our professional fee expense on Valesco is coming in kind of what we expected. I mean as I said, our rate of growth in the third quarter slowed from the rate of growth from the second quarter, although we continue to see subsidy request and we've got efforts to mitigate those.  There's no doubt the issue for us in the quarter was the Valesco operations as I mentioned. We\u2019re not clearing as much revenue than we anticipated. And I think it\u2019s best you have to look at that on a year-to-date basis, because we did make some revisions as we started to see claims being paid in the third quarter.  And we believe, as I mentioned, it's probably about a $50 million a quarter run rate for Valesco. We have a number of efforts underway to mitigate this that I spoke of as well. But in the short run, that's what we're sizing it at.  You're right, when you look at next year, we'll have three quarters of it this year versus four next year. But we'll give you more of our thinking when we talk about \u201824 later on, but you've sized it about right. \nA.J. Rice: Anything on the Florida? \nBill Rutherford: The Florida DPP was slightly above what we expected, but we had other programs A.J. that were less than we expected. So you got to look at it in the overall context of the revenue mix of the company and I don't think it's that discreet, necessarily to just focus on one element of it, so. But it was slightly above. \nA.J. Rice: Okay. All right. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. \nBen Hendrix : Thank you very much. Excluding Florida DPP from both quarters, EBITDA margin appears to have declined by about 180 basis points year-over-year, suggesting close to $300 million total headwind. If Valesco is $100 million of that, how would you characterize the remaining $200 million or so that brings us short of the 3Q 2022 margin?  You mentioned the higher subsidy requests and maybe DPP in other quarters or in other regions other than Florida. But is there anything else to call out there that would weigh on margin? Thanks. \nBill Rutherford: Yes Ben, this is Bill. Isolate the margin, really that other operating line is where you see we've lost some margin for over the years [ph] reported quarter. Valesco was about 50 basis points of that when you adjust for Valesco. Kind of the pro-fee growth was about 40 basis points and the balance was really due to the increase of the supplemental expenses that we recorded in the quarter relative to Florida DPP and other programs.  So the way I think about it, if you exclude Valesco, other operating was off about 120 basis points. 40 to 50 was the pro-fee effect and the balance was just the increase of the supplemental expenses that we recognized in the quarter. Labor was strong when I talked about a supply cost of strength. So it's really isolated to those two issues, the Valesco and supplemental payments as much as anything. \nSam Hazen: I think, Bill, just to add a point to that, our same facility operating margins, which did include those elements Bill spoke to, were actually in line with our internal expectations. So I think from the standpoint of a little bit of pressure, we anticipated some pressure, but it was reflected again in the overall performance of our same facility. So most of this lands on the Valesco challenge with respect to the revenue and the earnings associated with that venture. \nBen Hendrix : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Gary Taylor with T.D. Cowan. Your line is open. \nGary Taylor: Hey, good morning. One question and one clarification. Just on a clarification, I think we'll see this in the queue, but I think professional fees were 22% of other OpEx in 1Q, 24% in the 2Q. Just wondering what that number was for the third quarter. It sounds like it may be slowed a little bit or didn't change a lot.  And then my real question really was about hitting into \u201824. I mean, we see a lot of volume strength. I mean, if we look at the stat comps, year-to-year admissions, adjusted admissions, ER, all accelerated pretty nicely. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about carrying that volume strength into \u201824, and presumably the guidance you'll give us in a few weeks at Investor Day. \nSam Hazen: Well Gary, this is Sam, and Bill can jump in here. We believe again that our core business, our hospital-centric core business is performing well. I mean, our volumes were broad-based. Every division in our company had admission growth, had adjusted admission growth. Every service category in our business offerings had growth except for OB.  Our obstetrics volumes, mainly births were down slightly, pediatric was down slightly, and our behavioral was down because we made some capacity adjustments, and not because demand is shrinking in behavioral. Just because we needed capacity that we felt might be more productive. So across geography and across service lines, really solid performance.  On the labor front, we were investing in the quarter in our labor agenda at the same time as making improvements. And what I mean by that, we have invested heavily in new graduate training programs. We've done that throughout the year. That actually created a little bit of a headwind in the quarter and throughout the year for us. We think that will help us as we push into the fourth quarter and on into \u201824, with making adjustments to our labor agenda. We've invested in our Galen College of Nursing facilities, as well as our other clinical education. So we're investing in our agenda for the long-term prospects that all of these initiatives represent.  Bill spoke to the revenue yield. I think the revenue yield from acuity, payer mix, and pricing is positive. So I mentioned that our same-stores results were in line with our expectation.  I think the second thing that's important here Gary, is that we pride ourselves on making adjustments if we have a variance and I am confident in our teams. I'm confident in who we are as an organization. And we've proven it over time that we can make adjustments and find solutions to really complex problems.  And so we've got one. It's not what we anticipated. But again, we had the necessary requirements to consolidate a business that was struggling and somewhat distressed, but very important to our offerings in the community. So I think as we work through it, as we gain a better understanding of it, we will be able to make adjustments and get the proper reimbursement we need from the payers for the services that we're now providing.  And so, fortunately, our balance sheet remains strong as Bill alluded to, and our ability to invest in our agenda to maintain our positioning and execute on our agenda remains strong. So when I pull up and provide some context here, I'm encouraged by what I see in the quarter and for the year and what that portends for the company as we push into the future. \nBill Rutherford: And, Gary, this is Bill. On your clarification, pro-fees as a percent of other operating, it was just under 24% in Q3, similar to what it was in Q2. \nGary Taylor: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes : Hi, good morning. I know you don't want to provide 2024 guidance now, but is there any major headwinds and tailwinds that you want to call out before heading into the event? And to that degree, I know Nevada is introducing a UPL program. Do you have any sense what that incremental benefit will be next year? Thanks. \nBill Rutherford: Ann, this is Bill. Yeah there is. Only one we'll pull out, as I mentioned in my comments, is the payer settlement we recorded in the first quarter. Other than that, we'll give you our full commentary later on 2024. And on Nevada, it's still too early. We're waiting for the approval level and when we discuss \u201824, we'll update you on what our thinking is and the estimate of that is. \nAnn Hynes : All right, thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Sam, can you maybe just go back and elaborate on the ER revitalization program. How Valesco plays into that and exactly where you are in the evolution of that program and any tangible progress that you expect to see in 2024? Thanks. \nSam Hazen: So our ER revitalization program was initiated maybe a year ago, nine months ago, without remembering the exact point. We determined that a couple of things. One, demand for emergency room services continues to be robust. It was actually more resilient coming out of the pandemic than we had anticipated.  So we felt we needed to reenergize our operations, because we had had some turnover in our leadership and we had business opportunity associated with demand. So our teams came together and went about sort of revitalizing, for lack of a better term, our basic operations with respect to our emergency rooms.  We have proven standards and processes over time that we think create a really good experience and a positive outcome for our patients. And so we wanted to retrain a number of our new leaders, including some of our physician leaders through Valesco and others into these standards and these processes.  And the early results of our program are really positive. Our patient satisfaction is up four or five points from when we began the program. Our throughput continues to improve. I think we're seeing an ER patient within nine or 10 minutes with a clinician, as soon as they present to our door. Our throughput times with respect to discharging our patients has improved, as well as those who get admitted, we\u2019re able to get them onto the floors more efficiently than we were before.  We continue to believe we have opportunities to strengthen that program, and so we're expanding the reach of our training. Again, that will include our physician leaderships, both in Valesco, as well as other hospital provider contractors that we have. And we think this will play in well with into our investments that we're making, into our emergency room platform, both hospital-based as well as our freestanding emergency rooms, which continue to perform at an even higher level.  So all of that to say is its yielded volume growth, it's yielded patient throughput improvement, and most importantly, it's yielded patient satisfaction increases that we are encouraged by and we will continue to hopefully achieve. \nWhit Mayo: Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. \nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys. Sam, it seems like you have an idea of what needs to be done at Valesco. But maybe going down to the nuts and bolts of it, as we think about the fact that you employ these docs now, it sounds like this is more of a revenue issue. So is that just a matter of tacking them onto the HCA contract or what needs to be done there? Maybe just for Bill, and kind of related to this, if you can give us the contribution of Valesco to revenue per same-store admin. Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Let me speak to how we're approaching it. Again, we're learning as we go. I forgot the \u2013 I think it was like 5,000 physicians across, how many programs? \nBill Rutherford: 200 programs.\nSam Hazen: 200 different programs. A really large-scale business that again, we felt we were at a point where we had to make a decision and I am comfortable that we made the right decision for the company long-term.  So as we learn more and more about this business, we think there are going to be opportunities on how we allocate the staffing underneath this business. Obviously, our emergency rooms are 24/7/365. We won't necessarily change the staffing per se, but there could be complimentary approaches to that.  There are overhead opportunities we think over time we will be able to get to. But you're right, ultimately we will need to get paid for these services appropriately. We do have some contracts today. We feel like those will have to be adjusted in the future. And we are confident that we can achieve appropriate reimbursement underneath these programs and get us to where it's an appropriate service that's reimbursed reasonably as we get through it.  But that\u2019s just not happening immediately and that\u2019s part of the challenge. And again, we need anesthesiologists, we need emergency room physicians, we need hospitals in order to deliver the volume and maintain provisioning. And so that rationale went into our decision-making, and so now we have to rationalize the operations, and I think those are the areas that we're going to focus on. And we believe in a reasonable period of time we'll make progress on that. \nBill Rutherford: Brian, to your revenue numbers, Valesco revenue is just under $400 million year-to-date, about $380 million on a year-to-date basis. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. \nStephen Baxter : Yes, hi thanks. I appreciate all the commentary on the professional fees and the growth slowing in the third quarter. So it does still seem like a pretty challenging environment out there for those firms. And as we do some checks, hearing and anesthesia in particular remains a pressure point. Is this something that you think you can manage closer to flat going forward or is this just becoming part of the new norm around something that you'll need to offset as you think about the puts and takes for 2024? Thank you. \nBill Rutherford: Well, it's hard to call. We do believe the rate of growth is too slow going forward compared to what we've seen this year. As I said, we're working diligently on multiple work efforts, not only in Valesco, but working with our contracted providers as well. So again, I think we'll see slowing growth. We think we've dealt with some of the more acute issues out there. But the subsidy requests are still there, but we're managing through it and we'll continue to do that as we continue to go on. We'll update you on our progress. But we're working diligently to affect and slow that rate of growth and its impact on us. \nSam Hazen: I think Bill alluded to this in his commentary earlier about the pressures we saw with contract labor, nurse shortages, capacity management and so forth. And I would submit that we've worked our way through that reasonably well, and we still believe there are opportunities for us to make strides forward on that agenda.  We're going to learn from that how we managed that timely, aggressively, and responsibly, and I think apply those same learnings to the situation we have here, and get to an answer that makes sense for the company. And so I'm confident, as I've said, that we have the mindset and the wherewithal to work through these and get us to a reasonable solution. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nPito Chickering : Hey, good morning, guys. There are a lot of moving parts in the margin this quarter, but if you normalize for Florida DPP and the $50 million from prior period in Valesco, and look at the implied fourth quarter margin ramp, it looks higher than normal sequential margin improvement for the fourth quarter. So can you help bridge us or what are the key drivers to get to that implied guidance for margin for 4Q? \nSam Hazen: Yes, Pito, historically our fourth quarter is our best margin performance quarter. I mean, obviously this quarter was impacted a little higher than normal because of the Valesco 80 basis points I talked about, and the Florida DPP. Our state facility margins were over 20%, so we think our guidance is reasonable based on our outlook right now. But I think it's a combination of maybe not having some of the immediate pressures we had this quarter, and the expectation that the fourth quarter tends to trend stronger than our average. \nPito Chickering : All right, thanks so much. \nSam Hazen: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cal Sternick with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. \nCal Sternick: Thanks for the question. Just wanted to go back to Valesco for a second. So is the expectation that the $50 million loss per quarter persists this level throughout next year or would you expect to end the year at a slightly lower run rate?  And then just on the mitigation levers, I mean obviously it sounds like reimbursement is probably the bigger component here, but is there any way to give a sense for magnitude of the cost side? I'm just wondering if you could give some color on what those levers are, and just how much of that $50 million do you think could offset purely just with cost reductions? \nBill Rutherford: Yes, I mean, so right now as I said, probably $50 million a quarter, but we're working diligently to mitigate that. And as we go through the next couple of quarters and into \u201824, we'll continue to update our progress on that.  We view the primary issue as revenue shortfalls, and that's what we're working through. There are maybe some cost adjustments we can make, but I think it's primarily a revenue approach that we're going to take to try to turn the results around. And I just have to put -- it's $50 million a quarter, and we have confidence that we've dealt with similar issues in the past, and we'll work through that, but it's primarily a revenue challenge that we'll get through.  I did mention it earlier, but with our increased position, we now manage the revenue cycle all the way through. So I think that puts us in a much better position to assess and address some of these revenue trends. So we have the revenue cycle functions from contracting to coding to billing and collections. And so we think we're in a reasonably good position to be able to at least assess those trends and then come up with appropriate actions to respond to it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citi Group. Your line is open. \nJason Cassorla: Great, thanks. I guess with surgeries up about 1% in the quarter, a little bit better on the inpatient side. I wanted to ask about trends within service lines, and the comp was a little bit difficult this quarter, but anything to call out there?  And then Sam, it sounds like from your comments, you're not seeing any impact in GLP-1\u2019s and you don't expect much there, but just making sure we caught that right. And if you have any other thoughts on potential impacts to underlying demand or trends on the line, it'll be helpful. Thanks. \nSam Hazen: Yes, let me start with the GLP issue. We think it's way too early to make any judgment about the effects on our business generally. I think the second point that I would make related to GLP-1 is the fact that we have a very diversified mix of revenue as a company. I mean, obviously we've gone through orthopedic total joints going from inpatient to outpatient. We've seen other drugs come into the mix, statins as an example with cardiology. We're actually doing more cardiology procedures in the company now than we've ever done in the history of the company.  So, I don't really know how to judge the implications. Bariatric surgeries in our company is a really small program, less than 0.5% of overall revenue. Obviously we have patients who do have diabetes, but some of those patients aren't going to lose it necessarily immediately either. So, it's way too early to make judgments, we believe, around that.  When you look at the mix of business, again, as I said earlier, we had very broad-based service line performance that was solid. Very few service categories were down. We actually had a calendar headwind in the quarter with respect to surgical days and cardiology procedure days, where we had one less surgical day in the quarter than we did last year.  So our performance in the face of that headwind was strong as well. So that's what I would say. It was similar on inpatient and outpatient as far as the mix of service volume growth and so forth. So very consistent, very broad-based, again, across our geography, and so we're pretty pleased with the output. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open. \nScott Fidel : Thanks. I was hoping you could maybe talk about some of these recent developments in the environment as it relates to the potential indicators around future wage trends, and in particular thinking about some of the union actions that we've been seeing and some of these minimum wage laws that are getting passed at the state level, such as in California.  Just curious on sort of whether you see these in aggregate potentially creating some more pro-inflationary pressure on wages, or do you think that there may be a bit over, sort of focused on and won't affect the overall trajectory of the wage environment? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: The market for labor has normalized in very material ways compared to where it was a year to year and a half ago. And we're seeing it in our cost per hour as a company, which is really lined up with the expectations we've had for the year. And we've seen stabilization across the elements of our compensation programs and so forth.  There are some minimum wage laws out in California that has a very de-minimis impact on our company. Most of our compensation was already in line with that. We have very few issues with that.  Unionization across the country beyond the healthcare industry is an issue as everybody understands. But we have been successful in pushing through those issues organizationally and have landed in a spot that we think is not going to put too much pressure on our business in the near term.  And so that's where we are. Obviously the markets changed. They are dynamic, and we have to adjust to those. But we're seeing positive signs with respect to turnover, with respect to hiring, and even the number of new students who are populating our Galen College of Nursing programs is very encouraging, suggesting that there's a sufficient pipeline of new nurses who want to be educated and go into the workforce.  So we're pretty encouraged by the macros that we're seeing. There are obviously issues that we have to pay attention to, and we are, but we're reasonably encouraged with our overall agenda as it relates to our people and the efforts that we have in place. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. \nJamie Perse : Hey, thank you. Good morning. Just a bigger picture question for you guys. You've talked about longer term margins, 19% to 20% being a fairly sustainable range for you. A lot of moving parts right now. So just at a high level, is there anything you see in the business right now that can take you off of that trajectory more permanently and just your level of confidence in getting back to that margin rate and sustaining it going forward? Thank you. \nBill Rutherford: Yes, I mean \u2013 this is Bill. I think we have a reasonably long track record of producing margins that are in a pretty tight range. Even as we've dealt with periodic cost pressures, whether it be contract labor before or maybe bad debts in the previous cycle or physician costs now.  So I think as a team, we have confidence we can continue to operate the company at reasonably strong efficiency levels. We've spoken in the past, we have a number of initiatives around technology and innovation on resiliency programs that continue to target the opportunities to operate even more efficiently in the future. So I think our historical performance is a reasonable expectation for us and we've got opportunity to continue to drive efficiency through the organization.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is open. \nJohn Ransom: Hey, good morning. If I take your $380 million of Valesco, I think you did a little over $220 million in 2Q. So that means the revenue dropped sequentially by like $60 million. I know you're talking about this revenue problem, but in your guidance going forward, maybe you could clarify kind of your revenue and cost outlook to get you to that minus $50 million.  And again, why was it such a \u2013 I know seasonality, but why was it such a steep ramp in 3Q or decline in 3Q in revenue? Unless I'm doing my numbers wrong, thanks. \nBill Rutherford: Yes John, I alluded to this in my comments. We did make some revisions to our revenue estimates in the third quarter. In the second quarter, it's still new. We were putting providers on new contracts billing. We had not received a lot of claims being paid as claims started to be adjudicated and paid. So I think it's better to look at that on a year-to-date basis on there.  It's roughly $200 million a quarter, somewhere around that neighborhood. It\u2019s kind of what we think the model will be going forward. Again, it may fall on either side of that, but I think it's best to look at the year-to-date. We understand the third quarter drop, but it was really just because we had no history on there and as claims started to be paid, we were able to revise that.  So that's why it's $100 million EBITDA for the quarter. It was about the same year-to-date. It's kind of tied into our $50 million going forward. \nJohn Ransom: So its $200 million revenue, $250 million cost business is what's embedded in your guide going forward, just to be clear. \nBill Rutherford: Yes, if you want to think very broadly, that would be pretty consistent. \nJohn Ransom: All right, thank you. \nBill Rutherford: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. \nJustin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I'm going to pile on with this physician stuff. So just, I've never seen a business kind of be off this far from like you guys are obviously very, very good at what you do. I know this is a new business, but to be $50 million of revenue on a $250 million baseline, 20%. So I just the like, can you triple click on that for me and just say like, what did you think was going on versus what is?  And then the, for \u2013 when you gave your headwinds, tailwinds for next year, the only headwind you talked about was that payment, which makes sense. But you've given some numbers around the subsidy costs right, the physician costs that run through other operating. And they do seem like they've been a pretty big drag on margins. My estimate is somewhere around $300 million bucks, give or take year-over-year, versus kind of revenue growth.  Are you assuming that that's not going to grow at anywhere close to that pace next year or do you think you could like \u2013 and therefore it's not another $300 million headwind next year? Or are you just assuming that we can offset it? And so, we kind of grow normally ex-$145 million. Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: All right, Justin, well a couple of things. One, literally we talk about \u201924. We'll give you our \u201824 guidance assumptions, some of that on the Investor Day in more details as we go through the planning on there. But as I said, we are expecting the pro-fee growth rate trends to lower going forward and we're working diligently to make that happen.  On your opening question around Valesco, just to emphasize what Sam said, this was a very complex and large integration of 200 programs, 5,000 providers that happened very quickly. And we were operating maybe on some incomplete historical data. And as we started to see claims being paid, the revenue was just clearing at lower rates than we anticipated. And again, I think we've got a number of initiatives to try to offset that and so we're working on both of those.  But so, that's how I would address the Valesco shortfall right now. And then, we're continuing to work on the pro-fee and do expect that growth rate to decline going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. \nSarah James : Thank you. So, when I look at the moving pieces in the guidance revision and the change in the Valesco revenue, it looks like you guys are implying core is doing a little bit better, especially if I use midpoint. So can you give us an update on what you're seeing so far, the first couple months into 4Q volumes and how we should think about what 2023 guidance implies for the volume transition from 3Q to 4Q? \nBill Rutherford: Yeah. So, as you know, we don't comment on the current quarter. We've made, I think, several comments on the core business trends we're seeing with really strong volume, reasonable pricing, the core operating expenses of the company are doing well in labor market supplies. I think as a broad brush, it would be our expectation those trends generally continue going forward. We don't see anything from a macro perspective changing that. But again, too early and we're not commenting on kind of inter-quarter, early quarter activities.  But as I said, and Sam mentioned in his comments, we're pleased with the core fundamentals that we're seeing. Good demand in the market. We're positioned very well, and our same facility operations is going pretty well.  Unfortunately, we are dealing with the Valesco integrations and we'll overcome that. But I think you could reasonably expect that our core trends that we've seen year-to-date should for the most part continue at a reasonable pace. \nSarah James : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. \nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. I hate to beat this dead horse, but just on the reduction in revenues on Valesco as the claims were getting processed, I'm just curious, what was causing that reduction in revenue? Was that, a lower rate issue, was that payer mix, was that reduction in code submitted versus paid or was that just less services?  And then I know there's been some challenges to the No Surprises Act underway. I know the arbitration process just started back up again. Is any of that going to mitigate any of the impact there? \nSam Hazen: Yes. Yes, so it's hard to attribute the shortfall in any one area. As I said, we were operating on maybe some incomplete historical data as our model is, and probably an array of other issues that potential other hospital providers are experiencing.  And so, yes, we've got a number of initiatives that we're going to try to address that we've talked about. We can continue to see \u2013 we prefer to be an in-network providers to avoid the out of \u2013 the surprise billing and that IVR process. And so we're working with our payers diligently to be in-network and to get reasonable rates going forward, and that's going to be part of our action plan. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSam Hazen : Brianna, I think we're done, if you want to close the queue. \nOperator: Thank you. Seeing no further questions, I will now turn the call back over to Frank Morgan for closing remarks. \nFrank Morgan: Brianna, thank you so much for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining on the call. I'm around this afternoon if I can answer any additional questions you might have. Have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Consolidated net revenue increased 8.3% to $16.21 billion from $14.97 billion in the prior year period. This was driven by 4.5% growth in equivalent admission and 3.6% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. Same facility revenues grew 7.9%.  As Sam mentioned in his comments, the Valesco joint venture had a negative impact of approximately $100 million on the company's adjusted EBITDA in the quarter as well on a year-to-date basis.  A portion of the third quarter results was due to revising our revenue estimates from the second quarter as we began to see claims being paid. This result was not what we were expecting, as we are experiencing revenue shortfalls compared to what we originally modeled.  The Valesco operating results had a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 80 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Going forward, we anticipate the loss from this venture to approximate $50 million a quarter.  We are working diligently on multiple efforts to address these results, including making programming adjustments where necessary, deploying efforts to reduce the cost structure, and working with payers for more appropriate reimbursement.  As we have discussed previously, we have seen subsidy requests increase from contracted hospital-based providers. Professional fee expense for contracted providers have grown approximately 20% on a year-to-date basis, although we are encouraged the rate of growth of these payments slowed in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter.  In addition to the mitigation strategies discussed above, we continue to assess other operational adjustments within our cost resiliency programs to help offset some of the impact from these issues. Let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics. Our cash flow from operations was $2.48 billion in the quarter. Capital spending was $1.15 billion. We paid about $160 million of dividends and repurchased $1.14 billion of our stock during the quarter. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated range of 3x to 4x.  As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2023 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $63.5 billion and $64.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.94 billion and $5.13 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.3 and $12.6 billion, and diluted earnings per share to range between $17.80 and $18.50. We expect capital spending to approximate $4.7 billion for the year.  Before we open it up for questions, I'd like to provide some commentary on our year-to-date performance. We believe our core business metrics remain solid. Year-to-date, our same facility emissions have grown 3.3%. Equivalent emissions have grown 5.1%. Non-COVID admissions have grown 7.5% over prior year on a year-to-date basis.  Same facility ER visits have grown 5.7%. Inpatient surgeries have grown 2.3%, and outpatient surgeries are up 3.1%, all on a year-to-date basis. These volume metrics have outpaced our original expectations going into the year.  Our payer mix trends remain favorable. Same facility managed care admissions increasing 5.3%, and Medicare admissions increasing 4.3% on a year-to-date basis. Medicaid and uninsured admissions are slightly down from the prior year on a year-to-date basis. Our case mix index has held and increased slightly over prior year, and our same facility revenues have increased 6.4% on a year-to-date basis.  Our same facility labor costs and supply costs are below prior year as a percentage of revenue. Through a focused and diligent effort, our operating teams have done an incredible job of addressing the contract labor pressures we had last year. On a year-to-date basis, our contract labor expense is down 18% or over 300 million from the prior year. We have confidence that a similar focused and diligent effort will help address the current physician cost pressures over time.  Lastly, when we look at our current adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2023, we think there are several notable items to consider. We discussed in our year-end call in January, COVID support payments, the out-of-period Texas waiver payment, and the 340B impact from 2022, which all totaled approximately $500 million. And when you consider the $145 million payer settlement we recorded in the first quarter of this year, as we take all of that into account, we are pleased with the growth rate we've been able to achieve.  In addition, our diluted earnings per share, excluding losses on sale of facilities and losses on retirement of debt has grown 7.2% year-to-date. So I wanted to take a moment to put this quarter in some perspective. So with that, we look forward to your questions and I'll turn the call over to Frank to open it up. Yes, A.J., this is Bill. Let me try to take those. So let's talk about Valesco first and isolate that from our pro fees. I would tell you our professional fee expense on Valesco is coming in kind of what we expected. I mean as I said, our rate of growth in the third quarter slowed from the rate of growth from the second quarter, although we continue to see subsidy request and we've got efforts to mitigate those.  There's no doubt the issue for us in the quarter was the Valesco operations as I mentioned. We're not clearing as much revenue than we anticipated. And I think it's best you have to look at that on a year-to-date basis, because we did make some revisions as we started to see claims being paid in the third quarter.  And we believe, as I mentioned, it's probably about a $50 million a quarter run rate for Valesco. We have a number of efforts underway to mitigate this that I spoke of as well. But in the short run, that's what we're sizing it at.  You're right, when you look at next year, we'll have three quarters of it this year versus four next year. But we'll give you more of our thinking when we talk about \u201824 later on, but you've sized it about right. The Florida DPP was slightly above what we expected, but we had other programs A.J. that were less than we expected. So you got to look at it in the overall context of the revenue mix of the company and I don't think it's that discreet, necessarily to just focus on one element of it, so. But it was slightly above. Yes Ben, this is Bill. Isolate the margin, really that other operating line is where you see we've lost some margin for over the years [ph] reported quarter. Valesco was about 50 basis points of that when you adjust for Valesco. Kind of the pro-fee growth was about 40 basis points and the balance was really due to the increase of the supplemental expenses that we recorded in the quarter relative to Florida DPP and other programs.  So the way I think about it, if you exclude Valesco, other operating was off about 120 basis points. 40 to 50 was the pro-fee effect and the balance was just the increase of the supplemental expenses that we recognized in the quarter. Labor was strong when I talked about a supply cost of strength. So it's really isolated to those two issues, the Valesco and supplemental payments as much as anything. And, Gary, this is Bill. On your clarification, pro-fees as a percent of other operating, it was just under 24% in Q3, similar to what it was in Q2. Ann, this is Bill. Yeah there is. Only one we'll pull out, as I mentioned in my comments, is the payer settlement we recorded in the first quarter. Other than that, we'll give you our full commentary later on 2024. And on Nevada, it's still too early. We're waiting for the approval level and when we discuss \u201824, we'll update you on what our thinking is and the estimate of that is. 200 programs. Brian, to your revenue numbers, Valesco revenue is just under $400 million year-to-date, about $380 million on a year-to-date basis. Well, it's hard to call. We do believe the rate of growth is too slow going forward compared to what we've seen this year. As I said, we're working diligently on multiple work efforts, not only in Valesco, but working with our contracted providers as well. So again, I think we'll see slowing growth. We think we've dealt with some of the more acute issues out there. But the subsidy requests are still there, but we're managing through it and we'll continue to do that as we continue to go on. We'll update you on our progress. But we're working diligently to affect and slow that rate of growth and its impact on us. Yes, I mean, so right now as I said, probably $50 million a quarter, but we're working diligently to mitigate that. And as we go through the next couple of quarters and into \u201824, we'll continue to update our progress on that.  We view the primary issue as revenue shortfalls, and that's what we're working through. There are maybe some cost adjustments we can make, but I think it's primarily a revenue approach that we're going to take to try to turn the results around. And I just have to put -- it's $50 million a quarter, and we have confidence that we've dealt with similar issues in the past, and we'll work through that, but it's primarily a revenue challenge that we'll get through.  I did mention it earlier, but with our increased position, we now manage the revenue cycle all the way through. So I think that puts us in a much better position to assess and address some of these revenue trends. So we have the revenue cycle functions from contracting to coding to billing and collections. And so we think we're in a reasonably good position to be able to at least assess those trends and then come up with appropriate actions to respond to it. Yes, I mean \u2013 this is Bill. I think we have a reasonably long track record of producing margins that are in a pretty tight range. Even as we've dealt with periodic cost pressures, whether it be contract labor before or maybe bad debts in the previous cycle or physician costs now.  So I think as a team, we have confidence we can continue to operate the company at reasonably strong efficiency levels. We've spoken in the past, we have a number of initiatives around technology and innovation on resiliency programs that continue to target the opportunities to operate even more efficiently in the future. So I think our historical performance is a reasonable expectation for us and we've got opportunity to continue to drive efficiency through the organization. Yes John, I alluded to this in my comments. We did make some revisions to our revenue estimates in the third quarter. In the second quarter, it's still new. We were putting providers on new contracts billing. We had not received a lot of claims being paid as claims started to be adjudicated and paid. So I think it's better to look at that on a year-to-date basis on there.  It's roughly $200 million a quarter, somewhere around that neighborhood. It's kind of what we think the model will be going forward. Again, it may fall on either side of that, but I think it's best to look at the year-to-date. We understand the third quarter drop, but it was really just because we had no history on there and as claims started to be paid, we were able to revise that.  So that's why it's $100 million EBITDA for the quarter. It was about the same year-to-date. It's kind of tied into our $50 million going forward. Yes, if you want to think very broadly, that would be pretty consistent. Yeah. All right, Justin, well a couple of things. One, literally we talk about '24. We'll give you our \u201824 guidance assumptions, some of that on the Investor Day in more details as we go through the planning on there. But as I said, we are expecting the pro-fee growth rate trends to lower going forward and we're working diligently to make that happen.

And then, we're continuing to work on the pro-fee and do expect that growth rate to decline going forward. Yeah. So, as you know, we don't comment on the current quarter. We've made, I think, several comments on the core business trends we're seeing with really strong volume, reasonable pricing, the core operating expenses of the company are doing well in labor market supplies. I think as a broad brush, it would be our expectation those trends generally continue going forward. We don't see anything from a macro perspective changing that. But again, too early and we're not commenting on kind of inter-quarter, early quarter activities.

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "All right, good morning. Thank you for joining the call. The business fundamentals for the company were solid in the quarter with broad-based volume growth on a same facility basis across our footprint and various service lines. These results reflected continued strong demand for our services and healthy operating margins on a same facility basis. Across most areas of our business, we maintained the operational momentum that we experienced over the past three quarters, including continued progress with our labor agenda. Unfortunately, our results were unfavorably impacted by our Valesco hospital-based physician venture. Bill will give additional detail on this impact in a moment.  We are continuing our efforts to integrate this venture and anticipate implementing additional actions that should improve its operational results over the next few quarters, including less pressure for the company in the fourth quarter. Because of this issue primarily, we have lowered the top side of our earnings guidance for the year to reflect the effects of these losses.  It is important to understand that we believe the decision to consolidate Valesco was strategically imperative in maintaining the overall competitive positioning and capacity offerings of the company. As has been the case historically with our teams, I am confident that we will find a pathway forward to mitigate the impact it has had on our results. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share were $3.91. Same facility admissions grew 3.4% year-over-year. Inpatient volumes were supported by continued strong acuity and a favorable payer mix with same facility commercial admissions growing an impressive 7%.  Same facility equivalent admissions increased 4.1%. This growth was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 3.5%. We are encouraged by our ER revitalization program and the results it is producing for our patients.  Outpatient surgeries on a same facility basis grew approximately 1% year-over-year. Other outpatient categories also grew, including outpatient cardiology procedures, which increased almost 5%. These factors contributed to an increase in same facility revenue of 7.9% as compared to the prior year.  In the quarter, we continue to invest significantly in our people with additional investments in orientation programs, Galen College of Nursing, and clinical education facilities. Turnover was stable in the quarter and nurse hiring was the strongest it has been all year. These positive results help reduce contract labor costs 12.5% as compared to the third quarter last year and 11% sequentially.  During the quarter we maintained available bed capacity. Instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals represented only 0.9% of total admissions, which is consistent with the rate in the second quarter.  We believe the significant investments we are making in our networks, our people, and our technology agenda will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our service offerings and deliver higher quality care to our patients with greater accessibility.  I'm proud of our people for what they do every day to deliver on our purpose. I want to thank them for their dedication and their overall great work. HCA Healthcare has a disciplined operating culture that we will maintain into the future. This focused approach, which benefits all stakeholders, enhances our ability to execute clinically, strategically and financially.  So let me close with this. We look forward to our upcoming Investor Day on November 9th when we will provide more details about the company's approach to driving sustained long-term growth and shareholder value. We will also provide some early perspectives on the upcoming year as well as longer-term thinking on growth targets.  With that, I will turn the call to Bill for more details on the quarter's results. Kevin, this is Sam. It's our belief that demand for healthcare remains strong and will remain strong into the future. Just given the population trends that we see in our market, the aging of the baby boomers, as well as chronic conditions.  I know though there's been a lot of concern about GLP-1 and so forth. We think it's way too early for any of that to have an impact on demand in the near term or even the intermediate term. And so from that standpoint, we're really encouraged by what we see from a demand standpoint.  Our overall competitive positioning, we believe continues to be strong. It's indicated within our market share trends vis-a-vis where we were pre-pandemic, and so we're encouraged by that. We continue to have resources we believe, to continue investing in our company appropriately, and positioning our agenda with the necessary resources to accomplish our objectives.  And so from our standpoint, economies remain strong across our portfolio, and we believe that supports some of the payer mix trends that we've seen. So we're reasonably optimistic here that the overall top line metrics that you are seeing have durability. I think, Bill, just to add a point to that, our same facility operating margins, which did include those elements Bill spoke to, were actually in line with our internal expectations. So I think from the standpoint of a little bit of pressure, we anticipated some pressure, but it was reflected again in the overall performance of our same facility. So most of this lands on the Valesco challenge with respect to the revenue and the earnings associated with that venture. Well Gary, this is Sam, and Bill can jump in here. We believe again that our core business, our hospital-centric core business is performing well. I mean, our volumes were broad-based. Every division in our company had admission growth, had adjusted admission growth. Every service category in our business offerings had growth except for OB.  Our obstetrics volumes, mainly births were down slightly, pediatric was down slightly, and our behavioral was down because we made some capacity adjustments, and not because demand is shrinking in behavioral. Just because we needed capacity that we felt might be more productive. So across geography and across service lines, really solid performance.  On the labor front, we were investing in the quarter in our labor agenda at the same time as making improvements. And what I mean by that, we have invested heavily in new graduate training programs. We've done that throughout the year. That actually created a little bit of a headwind in the quarter and throughout the year for us. We think that will help us as we push into the fourth quarter and on into \u201824, with making adjustments to our labor agenda. We've invested in our Galen College of Nursing facilities, as well as our other clinical education. So we're investing in our agenda for the long-term prospects that all of these initiatives represent.  Bill spoke to the revenue yield. I think the revenue yield from acuity, payer mix, and pricing is positive. So I mentioned that our same-stores results were in line with our expectation.  I think the second thing that's important here Gary, is that we pride ourselves on making adjustments if we have a variance and I am confident in our teams. I'm confident in who we are as an organization. And we've proven it over time that we can make adjustments and find solutions to really complex problems.  And so we've got one. It's not what we anticipated. But again, we had the necessary requirements to consolidate a business that was struggling and somewhat distressed, but very important to our offerings in the community. So I think as we work through it, as we gain a better understanding of it, we will be able to make adjustments and get the proper reimbursement we need from the payers for the services that we're now providing.  And so, fortunately, our balance sheet remains strong as Bill alluded to, and our ability to invest in our agenda to maintain our positioning and execute on our agenda remains strong. So when I pull up and provide some context here, I'm encouraged by what I see in the quarter and for the year and what that portends for the company as we push into the future. So our ER revitalization program was initiated maybe a year ago, nine months ago, without remembering the exact point. We determined that a couple of things. One, demand for emergency room services continues to be robust. It was actually more resilient coming out of the pandemic than we had anticipated.  So we felt we needed to reenergize our operations, because we had had some turnover in our leadership and we had business opportunity associated with demand. So our teams came together and went about sort of revitalizing, for lack of a better term, our basic operations with respect to our emergency rooms.  We have proven standards and processes over time that we think create a really good experience and a positive outcome for our patients. And so we wanted to retrain a number of our new leaders, including some of our physician leaders through Valesco and others into these standards and these processes.  And the early results of our program are really positive. Our patient satisfaction is up four or five points from when we began the program. Our throughput continues to improve. I think we're seeing an ER patient within nine or 10 minutes with a clinician, as soon as they present to our door. Our throughput times with respect to discharging our patients has improved, as well as those who get admitted, we're able to get them onto the floors more efficiently than we were before.  We continue to believe we have opportunities to strengthen that program, and so we're expanding the reach of our training. Again, that will include our physician leaderships, both in Valesco, as well as other hospital provider contractors that we have. And we think this will play in well with into our investments that we're making, into our emergency room platform, both hospital-based as well as our freestanding emergency rooms, which continue to perform at an even higher level.  So all of that to say is its yielded volume growth, it's yielded patient throughput improvement, and most importantly, it's yielded patient satisfaction increases that we are encouraged by and we will continue to hopefully achieve. Let me speak to how we're approaching it. Again, we're learning as we go. I forgot the \u2013 I think it was like 5,000 physicians across, how many programs? 200 different programs. A really large-scale business that again, we felt we were at a point where we had to make a decision and I am comfortable that we made the right decision for the company long-term.  So as we learn more and more about this business, we think there are going to be opportunities on how we allocate the staffing underneath this business. Obviously, our emergency rooms are 24/7/365. We won't necessarily change the staffing per se, but there could be complimentary approaches to that.  There are overhead opportunities we think over time we will be able to get to. But you're right, ultimately we will need to get paid for these services appropriately. We do have some contracts today. We feel like those will have to be adjusted in the future. And we are confident that we can achieve appropriate reimbursement underneath these programs and get us to where it's an appropriate service that's reimbursed reasonably as we get through it.  But that's just not happening immediately and that's part of the challenge. And again, we need anesthesiologists, we need emergency room physicians, we need hospitals in order to deliver the volume and maintain provisioning. And so that rationale went into our decision-making, and so now we have to rationalize the operations, and I think those are the areas that we're going to focus on. And we believe in a reasonable period of time we'll make progress on that. I think Bill alluded to this in his commentary earlier about the pressures we saw with contract labor, nurse shortages, capacity management and so forth. And I would submit that we've worked our way through that reasonably well, and we still believe there are opportunities for us to make strides forward on that agenda.  We're going to learn from that how we managed that timely, aggressively, and responsibly, and I think apply those same learnings to the situation we have here, and get to an answer that makes sense for the company. And so I'm confident, as I've said, that we have the mindset and the wherewithal to work through these and get us to a reasonable solution. Yes, Pito, historically our fourth quarter is our best margin performance quarter. I mean, obviously this quarter was impacted a little higher than normal because of the Valesco 80 basis points I talked about, and the Florida DPP. Our state facility margins were over 20%, so we think our guidance is reasonable based on our outlook right now. But I think it's a combination of maybe not having some of the immediate pressures we had this quarter, and the expectation that the fourth quarter tends to trend stronger than our average. Yeah. Yes, let me start with the GLP issue. We think it's way too early to make any judgment about the effects on our business generally. I think the second point that I would make related to GLP-1 is the fact that we have a very diversified mix of revenue as a company. I mean, obviously we've gone through orthopedic total joints going from inpatient to outpatient. We've seen other drugs come into the mix, statins as an example with cardiology. We're actually doing more cardiology procedures in the company now than we've ever done in the history of the company.  So, I don't really know how to judge the implications. Bariatric surgeries in our company is a really small program, less than 0.5% of overall revenue. Obviously we have patients who do have diabetes, but some of those patients aren't going to lose it necessarily immediately either. So, it's way too early to make judgments, we believe, around that.  When you look at the mix of business, again, as I said earlier, we had very broad-based service line performance that was solid. Very few service categories were down. We actually had a calendar headwind in the quarter with respect to surgical days and cardiology procedure days, where we had one less surgical day in the quarter than we did last year.  So our performance in the face of that headwind was strong as well. So that's what I would say. It was similar on inpatient and outpatient as far as the mix of service volume growth and so forth. So very consistent, very broad-based, again, across our geography, and so we're pretty pleased with the output. The market for labor has normalized in very material ways compared to where it was a year to year and a half ago. And we're seeing it in our cost per hour as a company, which is really lined up with the expectations we've had for the year. And we've seen stabilization across the elements of our compensation programs and so forth.  There are some minimum wage laws out in California that has a very de-minimis impact on our company. Most of our compensation was already in line with that. We have very few issues with that.  Unionization across the country beyond the healthcare industry is an issue as everybody understands. But we have been successful in pushing through those issues organizationally and have landed in a spot that we think is not going to put too much pressure on our business in the near term.  And so that's where we are. Obviously the markets changed. They are dynamic, and we have to adjust to those. But we're seeing positive signs with respect to turnover, with respect to hiring, and even the number of new students who are populating our Galen College of Nursing programs is very encouraging, suggesting that there's a sufficient pipeline of new nurses who want to be educated and go into the workforce.  So we're pretty encouraged by the macros that we're seeing. There are obviously issues that we have to pay attention to, and we are, but we're reasonably encouraged with our overall agenda as it relates to our people and the efforts that we have in place. Yes. Yes, so it's hard to attribute the shortfall in any one area. As I said, we were operating on maybe some incomplete historical data as our model is, and probably an array of other issues that potential other hospital providers are experiencing.  And so, yes, we've got a number of initiatives that we're going to try to address that we've talked about. We can continue to see \u2013 we prefer to be an in-network providers to avoid the out of \u2013 the surprise billing and that IVR process. And so we're working with our payers diligently to be in-network and to get reasonable rates going forward, and that's going to be part of our action plan. Brianna, I think we're done, if you want to close the queue."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn it over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA is included in today's press release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Good morning. Thank you for joining the call. The company produced solid earnings in the second quarter. These results reflected continued strong demand for our services and healthy operating margins. Across most areas of our business, we maintain the operational momentum that we experienced over the past 3 quarters. We believe this strength should continue into the second half of the year. Accordingly, we updated our earnings guidance for 2023 to reflect this outlook. Against the difficult comparison to the second quarter of 2022, diluted earnings per share increased to $4.29. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong. Admissions grew 2.2% year-over-year, inpatient surgeries increased 1.8%, same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.7%. This growth was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 3.7% and outpatient surgeries which grew 3.3%. Other outpatient categories also grew, including outpatient cardiology procedures, with increased 5%. The growth in volumes was broad-based across the company's divisions and diversified within most service lines. Additionally, volumes were supported by strong acuity growth of 1.6% and a favorable payer mix from commercial adjusted admissions growth of 5%. These factors drove an increase in same facility revenue of 6.3% as compared to the prior year. In the quarter, we continued to invest in our people, and as a result, we saw improvements across virtually all key labor metrics. Turnover continued to decline for nurses and trended at an annualized rate of 17%. Nurse hiring remained strong in the quarter and for the year has increased by 9% as compared to last year. These positive results helped reduce contract labor costs 20% compared to the second quarter last year. During the quarter, we improved available bed capacity. Instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined and represented 0.8% of total admissions, down from 1.5% in the first quarter. We believe the significant investments we are making in our networks, our people and our technology agenda will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our services and provide even higher quality care to our patients. As we look to the future, we remain encouraged by both the backdrop of strong demand that we expect in our markets and our overall competitive positioning within them. HCA Healthcare will continue to use its disciplined operating culture to execute our strategic and capital allocation plans. I want to thank our colleagues for their dedication and their overall effectiveness. So let me close with this. I want to speak to a recent event that we take very seriously. On July 10, we announced that we had recently discovered a list of certain information with respect to some of our patients was made available by an unknown and unauthorized party on an online forum. We have confirmed that the list does not include clinical information, payment information or other sensitive information like passwords, driver's license or social security numbers. Our forensic investigation is ongoing, but this event appears to be a theft from an external storage location that was exclusively used to format e-mail messages. We are in the process of notifying all affected patients in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations. And not unexpectedly, we have been named as a defendant in multiple class action lawsuits. This incident has not caused any disruption to our day-to-day operations nor do we believe it will materially impact our business or financial results. HCA Healthcare believes the privacy of its patients is a vital part of its mission and remains committed to maintaining the security of their personal information. With that, I will turn the call to Bill for more details on the quarter's results.\nBill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Consolidated net revenue increased 7% to $15.86 billion from $14.82 billion in the prior year period. This was driven by 4% growth in equivalent admissions and 2.9% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating costs even with the backdrop of inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3% in the quarter. During the quarter, we completed our transaction to acquire a majority stake in the Valesco joint venture and we are now consolidating the operations of this venture. This reduced our consolidated margins approximately 30 basis points in the quarter. We believe this transaction not only mitigates business risk with the Envision bankruptcy proceedings but will also further support alignment between our hospital-based physicians and our hospital care teams on improving quality, patient satisfaction and efficiencies. When you consider this transaction and the $145 million payer settlement we recognized last quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margins have remained consistent between the first and second quarters. So let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics as they remain a key part of our long-term growth and value creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations increased $845 million in the quarter from $1.63 billion in the prior year to $2.475 billion this year. Capital spending was just over $1.2 billion. We paid $164 million in dividends and repurchased $915 million of our stock during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3 times to 4 times. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2023 guidance as follows: We expect revenues to range between $63.25 billion and $64.75 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.9 billion and $5.255 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.3 billion and $12.8 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.70 and $18.90, and we expect capital spending to approximate $4.7 billion during the year. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank and open it up for Q&A.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. [Operator Instructions] Bailey, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Maybe just -- I know Sam in his prepared remarks said that performance was solid across divisions. I wondered, there's been some discussion this quarter about Florida and Texas had come back early and had enjoyed strong volume. Now the rest of the country is rebounding. I wonder if you could comment on that. There was also a discussion from some of the managed care guys about particularly seeing strength in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and some pent-up demand being unleashed there. I wondered if you would comment on whether you're seeing any of that as well.\nSam Hazen: As I mentioned in my comments, our volume growth was broad-based across our divisions. I think we had 13 out of 16 divisions in the company that had admission growth and adjusted admission growth. We clearly have some divisions that don't perform the same pretty much every quarter, but it was fairly broad-based across top line metrics, admissions, adjusted admissions, payer mix improvements and so forth. So a fairly consistent performance. We did have a couple of divisions that struggled, but one was isolated in Florida. The other one was isolated more out west in the Midwest. And so for the most part, we were really pleased with the overall performance that we had across the geographies of the company. And it's interesting, I was looking at something yesterday. We have, from an admission standpoint, almost 72% of our hospitals have greater than 2% admission growth for the year. And this includes a little bit of pressure from COVID in the first part of the year from a comparison standpoint. We have very significant performance from the surgery standpoint as well, where almost 50% of our hospitals have inpatient surgery growth above 2%. So really consistent portfolio performance that speaks to the strength of our markets, I think the competitive positioning of our facilities and then the ongoing network development and physician development that we have as part of our core strategy.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.\nBen Hendrix: With regard to your updated guidance, can you provide some more color on what you're assuming for SWB, supplies and other operating expense, particularly professional fees through the second half versus what you've seen thus far this year? And then anything to call out that would alter typical cadence through the second half?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Ben, this is Bill. Let me start. I think our updated guidance reflects what we're observing in the market on our year-to-date performance, which continue [Audio Gap] in the growth opportunities. I think net-net, when I think about the margin profile of the company between the first half and the second half of the year, we'd expect the margin profile to be slightly better in the second half of the year. I think our salary, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue were running mostly where they're running year-to-date. Same with supplies. We have seen a little pressure on the professional fees. And we don't think that same pressure will exist in the balance of the year but will be able to meet us through that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners.\nWhit Mayo: Maybe just a question around labor. I think I heard you say, Bill, that contract labor improved maybe 20% year-over-year. Did it change much throughout the quarter? Just trying to get a sense of maybe the exit rate and expectations for the second half of the year?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. I mean, we're pleased with the labor environment. We did mention our contract labor is down 20% versus the prior year. It's improved as well sequentially between Q2 and Q1. Our hiring metrics are up, turnover is down. And I think that portends good things for us going through the balance of the year. We mentioned before, our contract labor cost as a percentage of our SWB was under 7%. I think it was 6.8% in the quarter. So again, I think we're pleased with that. Especially as we go through the summer months, some of our hires get through kind of their orientation process. And then we get into the balance of the year, we would expect some continued improvement.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Just two quick ones for me. Bill, I might have missed it, but I know often you kind of run through some of the managed care metrics on admissions -- adjusted admission and surgeries, I wondering if you could rattle off a few of those for us? And then secondly, I just want to make sure I understood on the Envision joint venture, I think we were thinking that was maybe roughly $250 million of revenue. But do all the expenses lie in the SWB line? Is that where those reside down to kind of a roughly EBITDA breakeven?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Gary, let me start with that. Some of our managed care, I think as we mentioned in the same mentioned her comments, really favorable payer mix. Our managed care admissions were up over 4% in the quarter. Adjusted admissions were 5%. I think we mentioned that in our prepared comments. Emergency visits managed care were up 9.8% in the quarter, and again, good acuity of case mix growth. So we're really pleased with the payer mix that we're seeing, and that showed itself in the commercial trends. Relative to the Valesco joint venture, your numbers are really close. About 70% to 75% of the revenue is in SWB and the rest is in other operating. And you're right, it's basically a breakeven proposition a little north of $220 million of revenue that we had in the quarter as we consolidated that.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Question on the pricing in the quarter. So with strong acuity and strong and strong payer mix, maybe can you remind us, is there anything in the second quarter that I might have slipped that, drove the pricing? I would have expected it to be a little bit better given those mix items and strong commercial pricing. And then, Bill, can you just give us what you expect in the back half of the year for volumes? Would that be the guidance?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Justin, nothing specific I will call out. I mean, obviously when we do year-over-year comparisons, COVID was still an impact for us. We had roughly $40 million of COVID support payments last year that we don't have this year. Our COVID admissions were 3% of total last year, roughly 1%. So that's still influencing a little bit on the revenue line. On our volume projections for the balance of the year, I think we'll be largely consistent. We've seen thus far, our year-to-date admissions same facility are about 3.3%. I would think for the full year, we hover around 3% as well for the balance of the year. Our adjusted admissions year-to-date are 5.6%. I would think by the time we finish full year, it's still 5% to 6% adjusted admissions. So I think the volume trends we would expect in the second half of the year will be pretty consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Phil Chickering with Detroit Bank.\nPhil Chickering: As I look at the implied revenue raise and EBITDA raise at the back half of the year, I'm trying to understand the flow-through of how much revenue raises should flow through into EBITDA upside. So how is it tracking in sort of 2023 versus sort of pre-COVID years?\nBill Rutherford: Well, when I think about that, when I look at the rate, it's based on where we perform them in our view of the position going forward. We do expect continued improvement in the labor market. But as I said, I think as a percent of revenue, we hold, I think the margin profile overall for the second half of the year will be slightly better than the margin profile we saw in the first half of the year. And that, all in all, has contributed to the guidance raise. I remind you, we've raised our guidance almost the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance, roughly $450 million from where we turn the calendar. So I think all that's reflective in our considerations right now.\nSam Hazen: Yes. And Bill, let me add a point here. I think it's a relevant point. Obviously, we've dealt with a fairly unprecedented labor market over the last 3 years or so. And we do believe, as Bill indicated earlier, it's moderating. We've also dealt with sort of an unprecedented hospital-based physician dynamic at a macro level. And if you just take a snapshot of where we are 6 months into this year versus where we were pre-pandemic when neither of these macro forces were in place, we've actually increased our margins by comparison to 2019. So I think it's sort of a testament to the ability of the company to adjust operationally to dynamics and continue to move forward with our strategy. As we've mentioned before, we think our competitive positioning has improved compared to where we were pre-pandemic.  Our market share has also improved during that time period. So we continue to believe that the company has the wherewithal to adjust to these factors, continue to move ahead in a very positive way and generate the results that we all want.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Group.\nAnn Hynes: I know it's early, but do you have any observations on how Medicaid determinations is impacting your business? I know one of your bigger states, Texas, started early. It sounds like it's been a little bit messy. So any early observations? And can you remind us if you have anything from the KB determinations in your guidance? And do you think this process is going to be an overall positive or negative for HCA?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Thanks for that. It's a good question. And you're right, it is still early, and we've got a pretty organized approach to not only continue to watch the market but respond on there. So we haven't seen any negative or any material impact on this today. We think what we're seeing many of the patients who are receiving determination, that there's some opportunity to continue to get them reenrolled in Medicaid, some of them are more technical. They either didn't complete an application or some other aspect of that. So our teams are trying to identify those individuals as best they can, assist them in gaining coverage, which remain encouraged by many of the studies that the people are being redetermined off, who will qualify either for coverage in an employer sponsor plan or qualify for coverage in the health insurance marketplace. And so we'll continue to watch that as that unfolds. But no impact right now. Nothing in our guidance is assumed for Medicaid redetermination. We believe over the long run, there could be some positive trends from this but we'll just have to wait to see how that plays out.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: I wanted to just maybe dig in a little bit more to kind of how you're thinking about the volume growth in the back half of the year. I guess when you think about [Indiscernible] trending relatively similar in the back half versus the first half, I guess the way we had been thinking about it any way was that last year, it felt like as COVID spiked at the beginning of the year and then became less and less of an issue that volume to started to kind of normalize in the back half of the year. And so that maybe the comp would be a little more difficult as you got into Q4 and if the growth rate might slow. So I just want to think about how you're thinking about volume growth and where you are versus maybe long-term trend lines and things like that. How do you put that into context about thinking this rate of growth will continue in the back half of the year?\nSam Hazen: Kevin, this is Sam. Let me give you sort of the backdrop, we think, of what exists for us with respect to volume. And this is more of a general commentary. I'll let Bill sort of reconcile the back half of the year to the first half of the year with numbers, I'm not sure I can do that at this particular point in time. As we said before, and we continue to believe this we feel that within our markets, there's unique attributes that are driving solid demand for health care services. Population growth continues to be strong in Texas and Florida, in Utah, Nevada, South Carolina, pretty much Tennessee. Across the board, we're experiencing population growth within our markets. The second point is we're investing very significantly in our strategy and our positioning within these communities so that we can respond to our patient needs, put our facilities in the best position to grow. And we think that's going to help us sustain market share growth as we move forward. What we're seeing is that our overall volume assumptions are supported by acuity. Acuity has maintained, some of that strategic, some of that, I think, is the dynamics that exist within the markets. And then the second support mechanism that's in place, and we view this positively, is the payer mix dynamic. We have seen throughout the first half of the year, commercial admissions outpaced our total admissions. Again, we think that's reflective of a strong economy and job positioning that a lot of people have in our communities as well as the exchanges. And so we think those will continue on into the last half of this year. And we're optimistic that those will continue on into the future, at least in the near term. So Bill, you can maybe try to reconcile\u2026\nBill Rutherford: I'll just say, I mean, when we think about projecting going forward, we try to take all of those factors into consideration, as Sam mentioned and where we're seeing year-to-date. Mind you, when we originally said our guidance, we anticipated 1% to 2% admission growth, mid-single-digit outpatient growth. So that's still hovering around 2% to 3% equivalent admission growth was our expectation. And given the fact that we're seeing north of 3% admission growth and 5.5% adjusted admission, that's informing our position for the balance of the year. So I still think around 3 is a good number for the full year now based on the first 6 months of the year. We're continuing to see good outpatient revenue growth. And so that should support this 5% to 6% equivalent admission expectation for the full year.\nSam Hazen: Yes. And Bill, if I can add one thing. With respect to our investments in our networks. We have, at this particular juncture, the largest pipeline of projects that are in motion, including our outpatient development components which are very robust as well as other inpatient and facility needs there. So our pipeline from an organic standpoint as far as capital that we will see hit the market in latter '23, '24, early '25 is more robust than we've seen in pretty much recent years.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Bill, you touched on the impact of Envision being a 30 basis point drag. I know there's some -- a lot of noise happening with American Physician Partners and just stuff moving around the physician staffing. So as we think about that drag, is there opportunity to bring that up? Or is that like a more structural thing where you've had to bring in in-house capabilities for physician staffing?\nSam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam. Let me start with that and Bill can color in here. As I mentioned, the backdrop in the hospital-based physician space has been very difficult over the past few years because of multiple factors. And for us, in the short run, we have had to respond to these difficulties to maintain capacity and service availability and so forth. And so we did what we had to do to make sure that our business continue to move forward appropriately. And for the most part, we've overcome these pressures and been able to grow, and we've increased our earnings expectations for the year in the face of some of these challenges. As Bill mentioned, we don't anticipate the same level of increases and pressures in the last half of the year, although we'll have some. But it's not going to nearly be what we've experienced in the first part, we don't think. And we do believe with the Valesco operations, we now have a platform that gives us the potential to respond better to these type of challenges and possibly integrate hospital-based physicians into our hospital operations even more effectively, producing better clinical performance efficiency and even growth, we think. And so -- and I'll say this again, I said it earlier, we have a pattern of responding to different kind of operational challenges, whatever they happen to be. We've had labor, as I mentioned. We've had physician costs. Currently, we've had uninsured in the past. And we've tended to overcome them. In the short run, sometimes they can create an individual pressure. But I think the scale of HCA, the resources that we have and the ability to execute allows us to move through some of these pressures over time and get where we want to be.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: I've got a strategic question for you on digital health and AI. I was just interested in the initiatives that you're kind of putting in place through the organization at this point, where you're maybe investing on the venture capital side here. And long term, what do you see is the opportunity for this, whether it's potentially reduced compensation or an ability to expand volume across the footprint?\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. We have a growing digital agenda in our company, and I'm very excited about what the prospects are for us around that. We are investing in a new clinical system, which we think is going to allow us to move information to the cloud more efficiently, and a matter of fact, move standard data sets into the cloud so that we can then use big data even more effectively and infuse that back into the care process. We will couple our digital agenda with something we're calling care transformation innovation. And inside of that, we believe we have opportunities to improve care processes, eliminate a lot of the variation that exists today in our company, create better quality and, at the same time, more efficiencies. Artificial Intelligence, we believe, will play a huge part in that. It's way early for us to know exactly what that will be and how that will influence our agenda, but we're encouraged about the prospects for it. We are partnering with some very sophisticated companies to help us push through this in ways that I think will accelerate our agenda and inform it with more expertise than what we have internally. So we're excited about what this can yield for us as we push into our next life cycle, if you will. And we'll wait to see what Artificial Intelligence, in fact, can do. But we view it as a positive potential for us in a very significant way.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Mok with UBS.\nAndrew Mok: I just wanted to follow up on the pricing discussion maybe from a different angle. Revenue per outpatient equivalent looks, like it was down about 1% in the quarter, which seems to be weighing on strong inpatient pricing up 6%. Can you help us understand the pricing and mix trends across your outpatient platform that are causing that unit revenue metric to blend down this year?\nBill Rutherford: Well, I'd say we're pleased with the outpatient growth that we're seeing. If you look at the overall outpatient growth that we have, it's -- our expectation was mid-single digits. We're well north of that in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. There's always a little bit of a mix issue that occurs. Our emergency room volume was up, what, 3.7%, which were a lot of are outpatient. Our outpatient surgical growth was up 3.3% in the quarter. So I think those are really good stats. On the outpatient revenue, per unit. There's always a blend between surgical, emergency room and diagnostic. But I would say, overall, we're very pleased with the outpatient overall growth that we are seeing.\nSam Hazen: Yes. And Bill, just the second quarter overall outpatient revenue growth was actually up over the first quarter. So we are seeing some acceleration. There's a lot of moving parts, as Bill just alluded to, to outpatient revenues between physician, clinics, urgent care, all the way up to outpatient cardiology procedures, which tend to be our highest reimbursed type of procedures. And so the mix of that can influence the outpatient. We tend to look at it in the aggregate. And for the most part, our aggregate revenue growth has been stronger in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. And then within sort of the pricing elements, we continue to get the targeted price increases that we want in both our inpatient and our outpatient businesses. So it's more, to Bill's point, sort of the mix and the mixture of all of the different components in a way that has produced solid growth for us.\nOperator: Next question comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan.\nCalvin Sternick: I wanted to ask about the commercial rate cycle. I think last quarter, you said you guys are about 2/3 of the way through 2024 and about 1/4 of the way through 2025. Can you give us an update on the progress and how those rate discussions are evolving?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. They're evolving pretty consistent. As we just mentioned, we're continuing to see rates in kind of the mid-single digit level. As far as contracted for '24, I think we're a little north of 70% for '24 now. And I think our efforts continue. I think our relationships with our major payers continue to be strong and we're pleased with the progress we're making in that area.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Interested just as against the backdrop where the managed care payers are seeing the higher medical cost trends this year, whether you're seeing any changes in behaviors when interfacing with them from a prior authorization or utilization management-type perspective? Or are things pretty consistent there? And then just a quick follow-up, just on the slight raise in the CapEx. Is that just related to the general broad-based investments that Sam just talked about? Or are there any specific projects that you would cite around the update to the CapEx guide?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, let me try to take both of those. I think as we maybe mentioned in the past, as you think about authorization and medical necessity reviews, those activities have picked up again as -- during the COVID period of time, those have eased a little bit. But we still see a lot of friction, if you will, as you go through that effort. We work with our payers to try to resolve those appropriately, make sure that we defend our positions where necessary. But there is a level of activity that both us and the payers have to devote to try to smooth through that process. But we tend to be able to work our way through it. On the CapEx, I think it's simply reflective of the opportunities we see in the market to continue to deploy capital for growth. Fortunately, we continue to see really strong cash flow to be able to support that CapEx. And again, I think it's reflective of the growth opportunities we see in the market.\nSam Hazen: And Bill, as we mentioned on the last call, we have acquired some land for future expansion in some of these fast-growing markets that we serve, and that's put some upward pressure on our capital spending. But we believe those are long-term good decisions for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citi Group.\nJason Cassorla: Yes. Great. Just wanted to ask a little bit more on the labor front. Thinking about all the efforts and programs you put in place contributing to the better turnover and hiring trends, I guess, is there a way to help frame what inning you're in as it relates to these efforts? Where do you like to see some of the outputs on turnover retention kind of move to? Or any other thoughts on the labor front and the trajectories there?\nSam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam. Thank you for that question. As I mentioned, we have invested very heavily in our people agenda over the past few years. We've increased our capacity within our recruiting function. Our recruiting efforts are yielding strong hiring, and we believe that will continue on into the latter half of the year. Our retention efforts with respect to responding to our employees' needs so that they have the necessary resources and tools to be effective in their day-to-day jobs, we're getting better at that. That's helping turnover.  Turnover is approaching pre-pandemic levels, especially in the nursing area. We are a few points above pre-pandemic. But if you annualize the second quarter turnover, it would suggest less than that. So we're encouraged by that, and we do believe we have opportunities to continue improvement in that area. With contract labor, as Bill mentioned, we expect to see improvements as we move through the last half of the year. And then I'm very excited about our workforce development initiatives. We continue to invest heavily in Galen College of Nursing. They're expanding each quarter, it seems, into new markets and establishing new relationships and new opportunities for people and for our company. And then we're also investing in our -- what we're calling our Centers for Clinical Advancement, which is our ongoing clinical education for our people so that they can upskill their capabilities and competencies and put them in a position to either deliver better care or grow in their own individual career. So what inning are we in? We're in the middle innings in some of the areas. And so we will wait to see how the latter half of the year plays out. But all in all, I think tremendous results. We're very competitive, we believe, across the organization with our compensation and benefit programs. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been able to navigate through these difficult periods and maintain margins. I think our labor costs -- again, if you just look at 2019 as a proxy, our labor cost in 2023 are below as a percent of revenue 2019. And again, that's in the very -- in the face of a very difficult labor market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.\nJamie Perse: Can you comment on seasonality expectations for the third quarter? Anything beyond normal seasonality from a headwind or tailwind perspective that we should be thinking about? And I think normally, revenue is down slightly and EBITDA down maybe mid-single digits to high single digits. Is that the right way to be thinking about the third quarter? And anything in July that's informing that? And then there was an earlier question on backlog that may not have been fully answered. I'd love your thoughts on that as well.\nSam Hazen: We mentioned at the end of the fourth quarter that we were starting to see normal seasonality patterns materialize. And we've seen that so far through the first half of this year, and we think that will continue on into the second half of this year. The third quarter is not as strong as the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is always the strongest quarter of the year for us given the outpatient activity and deductibles and so forth. And so we think the third and fourth quarter will be similar in patterns to pre-pandemic seasonality. And that's what's reflected in our guidance.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Steven Valiquette. Your line is open.\nSteve Valiquette: So I guess as a follow-up to just some of these prior questions on the labor and commercial rate update. There was some conjecture for HCA that the company didn't have quite as many commercial payer contracts up for renewal for fiscal '23 to capture some better rates for elevated labor costs, which you had more coming up for renewal in '24. Now that the noise levels kind of died down somewhat here in mid-23 on overall labor cost pressure versus -- certainly versus 12, 15 months ago, I guess the question is do you still have confidence to potentially capture potentially slightly better than average commercial rate updates for fiscal '24? Is labor pressure maybe still being the key variable within those discussions? Or are those going to be a little bit tougher now given that some of the pressure is subsided. Just want to get your kind of latest thoughts around that.\nSam Hazen: Well, this is Sam. Bill indicated that we're 70% contracted on '24 around our targeted escalation objective. Labor costs, as you mentioned, are moderating some. Yes, there's still inflationary pressures underneath it, as one would expect. Now we have physician cost pressures with respect to pro fees. And our belief is that, that will have to be paid for by someone. And so that will become a new factor in our thinking and our justification for appropriate price increases. So our cost are not just one category. We have multiple categories, as you can see on the income statement. And all of that factors into our considerations when we're negotiating.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJoshua Raskin: Were there any meaningful differences in the payer mix on the outpatient side, an obvious focus on Medicare and specifically Medicare Advantage volumes. And are you seeing anything in the Medicare market that would support higher levels of demand than we saw last quarter or the quarter before, anything that you feel like is inflecting?\nBill Rutherford: Yes, Josh, when I look at kind of the admissions versus adjusted admissions between the payer categories, they're comparable. Our Medicare adjusted admissions were up 5%. Our managed care adjusted admissions were up 5%, as we mentioned earlier, fueled by emergency room growth. So I think the trends are pretty comparable among the payer categories. And that's strengthening payer mix, that's, I think, positive trends for us. So nothing else underneath the outpatient area that I would distinguish, other than we continue to see good commercial ER traffic. Our commercial outpatient was up pushing close to 4% as well. So again, I think they're pretty comparable in terms of the general trends we're seeing.\nSam Hazen: I would say, Bill, just to put a little bit of color on the outpatient. Our commercial outpatient revenue growth is clearly outpacing our Medicare outpatient revenue growth. Some of the adjusted admissions are influenced by some of the calculations, if you will. But we are seeing really solid commercial outpatient revenue growth, again, influenced by the ER, influenced by surgeries, which are represented by roughly 50% to 55% commercial. So good growth there. And all of that yields solid commercial revenue growth.\nOperator: There are no further questions. At this time. Mr. Frank Morgan, I turn the call back over to you.\nFrank Morgan: Bailey, thank you so much for your help today. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week. And I'm around this afternoon if we can answer any additional questions you might have. Thank you very much. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Consolidated net revenue increased 7% to $15.86 billion from $14.82 billion in the prior year period. This was driven by 4% growth in equivalent admissions and 2.9% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating costs even with the backdrop of inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3% in the quarter. During the quarter, we completed our transaction to acquire a majority stake in the Valesco joint venture and we are now consolidating the operations of this venture. This reduced our consolidated margins approximately 30 basis points in the quarter. We believe this transaction not only mitigates business risk with the Envision bankruptcy proceedings but will also further support alignment between our hospital-based physicians and our hospital care teams on improving quality, patient satisfaction and efficiencies. When you consider this transaction and the $145 million payer settlement we recognized last quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margins have remained consistent between the first and second quarters. So let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics as they remain a key part of our long-term growth and value creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations increased $845 million in the quarter from $1.63 billion in the prior year to $2.475 billion this year. Capital spending was just over $1.2 billion. We paid $164 million in dividends and repurchased $915 million of our stock during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3 times to 4 times. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2023 guidance as follows: We expect revenues to range between $63.25 billion and $64.75 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.9 billion and $5.255 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.3 billion and $12.8 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.70 and $18.90, and we expect capital spending to approximate $4.7 billion during the year. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank and open it up for Q&A. Yes, Ben, this is Bill. Let me start. I think our updated guidance reflects what we're observing in the market on our year-to-date performance, which continue [Audio Gap] in the growth opportunities. I think net-net, when I think about the margin profile of the company between the first half and the second half of the year, we'd expect the margin profile to be slightly better in the second half of the year. I think our salary, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue were running mostly where they're running year-to-date. Same with supplies. We have seen a little pressure on the professional fees. And we don't think that same pressure will exist in the balance of the year but will be able to meet us through that. Yes. I mean, we're pleased with the labor environment. We did mention our contract labor is down 20% versus the prior year. It's improved as well sequentially between Q2 and Q1. Our hiring metrics are up, turnover is down. And I think that portends good things for us going through the balance of the year. We mentioned before, our contract labor cost as a percentage of our SWB was under 7%. I think it was 6.8% in the quarter. So again, I think we're pleased with that. Especially as we go through the summer months, some of our hires get through kind of their orientation process. And then we get into the balance of the year, we would expect some continued improvement. Yes. Gary, let me start with that. Some of our managed care, I think as we mentioned in the same mentioned her comments, really favorable payer mix. Our managed care admissions were up over 4% in the quarter. Adjusted admissions were 5%. I think we mentioned that in our prepared comments. Emergency visits managed care were up 9.8% in the quarter, and again, good acuity of case mix growth. So we're really pleased with the payer mix that we're seeing, and that showed itself in the commercial trends. Relative to the Valesco joint venture, your numbers are really close. About 70% to 75% of the revenue is in SWB and the rest is in other operating. And you're right, it's basically a breakeven proposition a little north of $220 million of revenue that we had in the quarter as we consolidated that. Yes. Justin, nothing specific I will call out. I mean, obviously when we do year-over-year comparisons, COVID was still an impact for us. We had roughly $40 million of COVID support payments last year that we don't have this year. Our COVID admissions were 3% of total last year, roughly 1%. So that's still influencing a little bit on the revenue line. On our volume projections for the balance of the year, I think we'll be largely consistent. We've seen thus far, our year-to-date admissions same facility are about 3.3%. I would think for the full year, we hover around 3% as well for the balance of the year. Our adjusted admissions year-to-date are 5.6%. I would think by the time we finish full year, it's still 5% to 6% adjusted admissions. So I think the volume trends we would expect in the second half of the year will be pretty consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year. Well, when I think about that, when I look at the rate, it's based on where we perform them in our view of the position going forward. We do expect continued improvement in the labor market. But as I said, I think as a percent of revenue, we hold, I think the margin profile overall for the second half of the year will be slightly better than the margin profile we saw in the first half of the year. And that, all in all, has contributed to the guidance raise. I remind you, we've raised our guidance almost the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance, roughly $450 million from where we turn the calendar. So I think all that's reflective in our considerations right now. Yes. Thanks for that. It's a good question. And you're right, it is still early, and we've got a pretty organized approach to not only continue to watch the market but respond on there. So we haven't seen any negative or any material impact on this today. We think what we're seeing many of the patients who are receiving determination, that there's some opportunity to continue to get them reenrolled in Medicaid, some of them are more technical. They either didn't complete an application or some other aspect of that. So our teams are trying to identify those individuals as best they can, assist them in gaining coverage, which remain encouraged by many of the studies that the people are being redetermined off, who will qualify either for coverage in an employer sponsor plan or qualify for coverage in the health insurance marketplace. And so we'll continue to watch that as that unfolds. But no impact right now. Nothing in our guidance is assumed for Medicaid redetermination. We believe over the long run, there could be some positive trends from this but we'll just have to wait to see how that plays out. I'll just say, I mean, when we think about projecting going forward, we try to take all of those factors into consideration, as Sam mentioned and where we're seeing year-to-date. Mind you, when we originally said our guidance, we anticipated 1% to 2% admission growth, mid-single-digit outpatient growth. So that's still hovering around 2% to 3% equivalent admission growth was our expectation. And given the fact that we're seeing north of 3% admission growth and 5.5% adjusted admission, that's informing our position for the balance of the year. So I still think around 3 is a good number for the full year now based on the first 6 months of the year. We're continuing to see good outpatient revenue growth. And so that should support this 5% to 6% equivalent admission expectation for the full year. Well, I'd say we're pleased with the outpatient growth that we're seeing. If you look at the overall outpatient growth that we have, it's -- our expectation was mid-single digits. We're well north of that in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. There's always a little bit of a mix issue that occurs. Our emergency room volume was up, what, 3.7%, which were a lot of are outpatient. Our outpatient surgical growth was up 3.3% in the quarter. So I think those are really good stats. On the outpatient revenue, per unit. There's always a blend between surgical, emergency room and diagnostic. But I would say, overall, we're very pleased with the outpatient overall growth that we are seeing. Yes. They're evolving pretty consistent. As we just mentioned, we're continuing to see rates in kind of the mid-single digit level. As far as contracted for '24, I think we're a little north of 70% for '24 now. And I think our efforts continue. I think our relationships with our major payers continue to be strong and we're pleased with the progress we're making in that area. Yes, let me try to take both of those. I think as we maybe mentioned in the past, as you think about authorization and medical necessity reviews, those activities have picked up again as -- during the COVID period of time, those have eased a little bit. But we still see a lot of friction, if you will, as you go through that effort. We work with our payers to try to resolve those appropriately, make sure that we defend our positions where necessary. But there is a level of activity that both us and the payers have to devote to try to smooth through that process. But we tend to be able to work our way through it. On the CapEx, I think it's simply reflective of the opportunities we see in the market to continue to deploy capital for growth. Fortunately, we continue to see really strong cash flow to be able to support that CapEx. And again, I think it's reflective of the growth opportunities we see in the market. Yes, Josh, when I look at kind of the admissions versus adjusted admissions between the payer categories, they're comparable. Our Medicare adjusted admissions were up 5%. Our managed care adjusted admissions were up 5%, as we mentioned earlier, fueled by emergency room growth. So I think the trends are pretty comparable among the payer categories. And that's strengthening payer mix, that's, I think, positive trends for us. So nothing else underneath the outpatient area that I would distinguish, other than we continue to see good commercial ER traffic. Our commercial outpatient was up pushing close to 4% as well. So again, I think they're pretty comparable in terms of the general trends we're seeing."

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for joining the call. The company produced solid earnings in the second quarter. These results reflected continued strong demand for our services and healthy operating margins. Across most areas of our business, we maintain the operational momentum that we experienced over the past 3 quarters. We believe this strength should continue into the second half of the year. Accordingly, we updated our earnings guidance for 2023 to reflect this outlook. Against the difficult comparison to the second quarter of 2022, diluted earnings per share increased to $4.29. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong. Admissions grew 2.2% year-over-year, inpatient surgeries increased 1.8%, same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.7%. This growth was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 3.7% and outpatient surgeries which grew 3.3%. Other outpatient categories also grew, including outpatient cardiology procedures, with increased 5%. The growth in volumes was broad-based across the company's divisions and diversified within most service lines. Additionally, volumes were supported by strong acuity growth of 1.6% and a favorable payer mix from commercial adjusted admissions growth of 5%. These factors drove an increase in same facility revenue of 6.3% as compared to the prior year. In the quarter, we continued to invest in our people, and as a result, we saw improvements across virtually all key labor metrics. Turnover continued to decline for nurses and trended at an annualized rate of 17%. Nurse hiring remained strong in the quarter and for the year has increased by 9% as compared to last year. These positive results helped reduce contract labor costs 20% compared to the second quarter last year. During the quarter, we improved available bed capacity. Instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined and represented 0.8% of total admissions, down from 1.5% in the first quarter. We believe the significant investments we are making in our networks, our people and our technology agenda will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our services and provide even higher quality care to our patients. As we look to the future, we remain encouraged by both the backdrop of strong demand that we expect in our markets and our overall competitive positioning within them. HCA Healthcare will continue to use its disciplined operating culture to execute our strategic and capital allocation plans. I want to thank our colleagues for their dedication and their overall effectiveness. So let me close with this. I want to speak to a recent event that we take very seriously. On July 10, we announced that we had recently discovered a list of certain information with respect to some of our patients was made available by an unknown and unauthorized party on an online forum. We have confirmed that the list does not include clinical information, payment information or other sensitive information like passwords, driver's license or social security numbers. Our forensic investigation is ongoing, but this event appears to be a theft from an external storage location that was exclusively used to format e-mail messages. We are in the process of notifying all affected patients in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations. And not unexpectedly, we have been named as a defendant in multiple class action lawsuits. This incident has not caused any disruption to our day-to-day operations nor do we believe it will materially impact our business or financial results. HCA Healthcare believes the privacy of its patients is a vital part of its mission and remains committed to maintaining the security of their personal information. With that, I will turn the call to Bill for more details on the quarter's results. As I mentioned in my comments, our volume growth was broad-based across our divisions. I think we had 13 out of 16 divisions in the company that had admission growth and adjusted admission growth. We clearly have some divisions that don't perform the same pretty much every quarter, but it was fairly broad-based across top line metrics, admissions, adjusted admissions, payer mix improvements and so forth. So a fairly consistent performance. We did have a couple of divisions that struggled, but one was isolated in Florida. The other one was isolated more out west in the Midwest. And so for the most part, we were really pleased with the overall performance that we had across the geographies of the company. And it's interesting, I was looking at something yesterday. We have, from an admission standpoint, almost 72% of our hospitals have greater than 2% admission growth for the year. And this includes a little bit of pressure from COVID in the first part of the year from a comparison standpoint. We have very significant performance from the surgery standpoint as well, where almost 50% of our hospitals have inpatient surgery growth above 2%. So really consistent portfolio performance that speaks to the strength of our markets, I think the competitive positioning of our facilities and then the ongoing network development and physician development that we have as part of our core strategy. Yes. And Bill, let me add a point here. I think it's a relevant point. Obviously, we've dealt with a fairly unprecedented labor market over the last 3 years or so. And we do believe, as Bill indicated earlier, it's moderating. We've also dealt with sort of an unprecedented hospital-based physician dynamic at a macro level. And if you just take a snapshot of where we are 6 months into this year versus where we were pre-pandemic when neither of these macro forces were in place, we've actually increased our margins by comparison to 2019. So I think it's sort of a testament to the ability of the company to adjust operationally to dynamics and continue to move forward with our strategy. As we've mentioned before, we think our competitive positioning has improved compared to where we were pre-pandemic.  Our market share has also improved during that time period. So we continue to believe that the company has the wherewithal to adjust to these factors, continue to move ahead in a very positive way and generate the results that we all want. Kevin, this is Sam. Let me give you sort of the backdrop, we think, of what exists for us with respect to volume. And this is more of a general commentary. I'll let Bill sort of reconcile the back half of the year to the first half of the year with numbers, I'm not sure I can do that at this particular point in time. As we said before, and we continue to believe this we feel that within our markets, there's unique attributes that are driving solid demand for health care services. Population growth continues to be strong in Texas and Florida, in Utah, Nevada, South Carolina, pretty much Tennessee. Across the board, we're experiencing population growth within our markets. The second point is we're investing very significantly in our strategy and our positioning within these communities so that we can respond to our patient needs, put our facilities in the best position to grow. And we think that's going to help us sustain market share growth as we move forward. What we're seeing is that our overall volume assumptions are supported by acuity. Acuity has maintained, some of that strategic, some of that, I think, is the dynamics that exist within the markets. And then the second support mechanism that's in place, and we view this positively, is the payer mix dynamic. We have seen throughout the first half of the year, commercial admissions outpaced our total admissions. Again, we think that's reflective of a strong economy and job positioning that a lot of people have in our communities as well as the exchanges. And so we think those will continue on into the last half of this year. And we're optimistic that those will continue on into the future, at least in the near term. So Bill, you can maybe try to reconcile... Yes. And Bill, if I can add one thing. With respect to our investments in our networks. We have, at this particular juncture, the largest pipeline of projects that are in motion, including our outpatient development components which are very robust as well as other inpatient and facility needs there. So our pipeline from an organic standpoint as far as capital that we will see hit the market in latter '23, '24, early '25 is more robust than we've seen in pretty much recent years. Yes. This is Sam. Let me start with that and Bill can color in here. As I mentioned, the backdrop in the hospital-based physician space has been very difficult over the past few years because of multiple factors. And for us, in the short run, we have had to respond to these difficulties to maintain capacity and service availability and so forth. And so we did what we had to do to make sure that our business continue to move forward appropriately. And for the most part, we've overcome these pressures and been able to grow, and we've increased our earnings expectations for the year in the face of some of these challenges. As Bill mentioned, we don't anticipate the same level of increases and pressures in the last half of the year, although we'll have some. But it's not going to nearly be what we've experienced in the first part, we don't think. And we do believe with the Valesco operations, we now have a platform that gives us the potential to respond better to these type of challenges and possibly integrate hospital-based physicians into our hospital operations even more effectively, producing better clinical performance efficiency and even growth, we think. And so -- and I'll say this again, I said it earlier, we have a pattern of responding to different kind of operational challenges, whatever they happen to be. We've had labor, as I mentioned. We've had physician costs. Currently, we've had uninsured in the past. And we've tended to overcome them. In the short run, sometimes they can create an individual pressure. But I think the scale of HCA, the resources that we have and the ability to execute allows us to move through some of these pressures over time and get where we want to be. This is Sam. We have a growing digital agenda in our company, and I'm very excited about what the prospects are for us around that. We are investing in a new clinical system, which we think is going to allow us to move information to the cloud more efficiently, and a matter of fact, move standard data sets into the cloud so that we can then use big data even more effectively and infuse that back into the care process. We will couple our digital agenda with something we're calling care transformation innovation. And inside of that, we believe we have opportunities to improve care processes, eliminate a lot of the variation that exists today in our company, create better quality and, at the same time, more efficiencies. Artificial Intelligence, we believe, will play a huge part in that. It's way early for us to know exactly what that will be and how that will influence our agenda, but we're encouraged about the prospects for it. We are partnering with some very sophisticated companies to help us push through this in ways that I think will accelerate our agenda and inform it with more expertise than what we have internally. So we're excited about what this can yield for us as we push into our next life cycle, if you will. And we'll wait to see what Artificial Intelligence, in fact, can do. But we view it as a positive potential for us in a very significant way. Yes. And Bill, just the second quarter overall outpatient revenue growth was actually up over the first quarter. So we are seeing some acceleration. There's a lot of moving parts, as Bill just alluded to, to outpatient revenues between physician, clinics, urgent care, all the way up to outpatient cardiology procedures, which tend to be our highest reimbursed type of procedures. And so the mix of that can influence the outpatient. We tend to look at it in the aggregate. And for the most part, our aggregate revenue growth has been stronger in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. And then within sort of the pricing elements, we continue to get the targeted price increases that we want in both our inpatient and our outpatient businesses. So it's more, to Bill's point, sort of the mix and the mixture of all of the different components in a way that has produced solid growth for us. And Bill, as we mentioned on the last call, we have acquired some land for future expansion in some of these fast-growing markets that we serve, and that's put some upward pressure on our capital spending. But we believe those are long-term good decisions for us. Yes. This is Sam. Thank you for that question. As I mentioned, we have invested very heavily in our people agenda over the past few years. We've increased our capacity within our recruiting function. Our recruiting efforts are yielding strong hiring, and we believe that will continue on into the latter half of the year. Our retention efforts with respect to responding to our employees' needs so that they have the necessary resources and tools to be effective in their day-to-day jobs, we're getting better at that. That's helping turnover.  Turnover is approaching pre-pandemic levels, especially in the nursing area. We are a few points above pre-pandemic. But if you annualize the second quarter turnover, it would suggest less than that. So we're encouraged by that, and we do believe we have opportunities to continue improvement in that area. With contract labor, as Bill mentioned, we expect to see improvements as we move through the last half of the year. And then I'm very excited about our workforce development initiatives. We continue to invest heavily in Galen College of Nursing. They're expanding each quarter, it seems, into new markets and establishing new relationships and new opportunities for people and for our company. And then we're also investing in our -- what we're calling our Centers for Clinical Advancement, which is our ongoing clinical education for our people so that they can upskill their capabilities and competencies and put them in a position to either deliver better care or grow in their own individual career. So what inning are we in? We're in the middle innings in some of the areas. And so we will wait to see how the latter half of the year plays out. But all in all, I think tremendous results. We're very competitive, we believe, across the organization with our compensation and benefit programs. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been able to navigate through these difficult periods and maintain margins. I think our labor costs -- again, if you just look at 2019 as a proxy, our labor cost in 2023 are below as a percent of revenue 2019. And again, that's in the very -- in the face of a very difficult labor market. We mentioned at the end of the fourth quarter that we were starting to see normal seasonality patterns materialize. And we've seen that so far through the first half of this year, and we think that will continue on into the second half of this year. The third quarter is not as strong as the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is always the strongest quarter of the year for us given the outpatient activity and deductibles and so forth. And so we think the third and fourth quarter will be similar in patterns to pre-pandemic seasonality. And that's what's reflected in our guidance. Well, this is Sam. Bill indicated that we're 70% contracted on '24 around our targeted escalation objective. Labor costs, as you mentioned, are moderating some. Yes, there's still inflationary pressures underneath it, as one would expect. Now we have physician cost pressures with respect to pro fees. And our belief is that, that will have to be paid for by someone. And so that will become a new factor in our thinking and our justification for appropriate price increases. So our cost are not just one category. We have multiple categories, as you can see on the income statement. And all of that factors into our considerations when we're negotiating. I would say, Bill, just to put a little bit of color on the outpatient. Our commercial outpatient revenue growth is clearly outpacing our Medicare outpatient revenue growth. Some of the adjusted admissions are influenced by some of the calculations, if you will. But we are seeing really solid commercial outpatient revenue growth, again, influenced by the ER, influenced by surgeries, which are represented by roughly 50% to 55% commercial. So good growth there. And all of that yields solid commercial revenue growth."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we will take a few questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today\u2019s call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today\u2019s press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning\u2019s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today\u2019s release. This morning\u2019s call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Alright. Thank you, Frank, and good morning. Thank you for joining our call. The operational momentum we had at the end of the last year continued into the first quarter of 2023. The company produced solid earnings that reflected strong demand for our services and improvements in our operating costs in particular contract labor expenses. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share excluding losses on sales of facilities grew by almost 20% to $4.93. Adjusted EBITDA grew close to 8%. Same facility volumes across the company were strong in the first quarter, admissions grew 4.4% year-over-year. Non-COVID admissions were up 12%. Our inpatient business continued to be supported by strong acuity and a favorable payer mix. Inpatient surgeries increased 3.6%. Same facility equivalent admissions increased 7.5%. This was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 10% and outpatient surgeries, which grew 5%. Other outpatient categories also grew including outpatient cardiology procedures, which increased 7%. The demand increase was broad-based across most of the company's footprint and service lines contributing to same facility revenue growth of 5%, as compared to the prior year. With respect to our people agenda, we saw continued improvements across virtually all metrics. The improvement in turnover rates accelerated from the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter close to pre-pandemic levels. Registered nurse hiring also improved in the quarter. Hiring increased almost 19%, compared to the previous four quarter average. These positive results helped reduce contract labor cost 21%, compared to last year. We continue to invest in our people through compensation programs, increased training and innovative care models. We believe these programs advanced our capabilities to provide high quality care to our patients. Once again, our colleagues demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt and deliver value across all stakeholder groups. I want to thank them for their dedication, their hard work, and their overall effectiveness. During the quarter, we continued to experience periodic capacity constraints that prevented us from fully operating our capacity. As compared to the fourth quarter, instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined 25% and represented 1.5% of total admissions in the quarter, which was down from 2% in the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with this improved trend it still remains above pre-pandemic levels. Close with this, we remain encouraged by the backdrop of strong demand that we saw in our markets. We intend to maintain our disciplined approach to executing our strategic and capital allocation plans as we push through the rest of this year. And lastly, we believe the investments we are making in our network, our people and our technology will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our services and provide high quality care to our patients. Given the strong results in the quarter and the favorable factors we expect with demand, you will see that we have increased our guidance for the year. With that, I'll turn the call to Bill for more details.\nBill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $3.17 billion, as compared to $2.94 billion in the prior year. As noted in our release, in the first quarter of this year, we recorded an increase in revenues of $145 million related to resolving certain disputed claims with a commercial payer that covered a six-year period. In the prior year quarter, we recorded an additional $244 million of revenues and $90 million of expenses that related to the Texas directed payment program for an earlier period. I will also note, as it relates to prior year comparisons, we still were experiencing high level of COVID volumes in the first quarter of 2022. COVID admissions accounted for 9.7% of admissions last year, compared to about 3% this year. In addition, in the prior year quarter, we recognized approximately $190 million of COVID-related support payments versus about $30 million in this year's first quarter. Sam highlighted our positive volume metrics in the quarter and this was coupled with good payer mix and case mix trends. Same facility managed care and other admissions grew 4.2% during the quarter, when compared to the prior year and non-COVID managed care admissions grew 11.3% versus the prior year. Non-COVID case mix improved just under 1%, as compared to both prior year and sequentially from the fourth quarter. This contributed to our non-COVID inpatient revenue per admission increasing 2.2%, as compared to the first quarter of last year. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating cost even with the backdrop of higher inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.3% in the quarter. Labor cost as a percentage of revenue improved both sequentially and when compared to the prior year and our supply costs continue to trend favorably as well. We have discussed previously other operating expenses have been subject to some inflationary cost pressures and increased approximately 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue, when compared to the prior year. So let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics as they remain a key part of our long-term growth and value creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations increased $458 million in the quarter from $1.35 billion in the prior year to $1.8 billion this year. Capital spending was just under $1.2 billion. We paid $175 million in dividends and repurchased just under $850 million of our stock during the quarter. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3 times to 4 times. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full-year 2023 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $62.5 billion and $64.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.75 billion and $5.16 billion. We expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.1 billion and $12.7 billion. And we expect full-year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.25 and $18.55. And lastly, we expect capital spending to approximate $4.6 billion during the year. I will mention that our updated capital spending guidance is based on opportunities we believe exist to continue to invest growth agenda, and it also considers some land acquisitions we are planning for future development. In addition, we are seeing some inflationary increases in construction costs that we have factored into our guidance as well. Finally, I will mention, in early April, we closed on a transaction to increase our ownership interest in the Valesco joint venture with Envision. We will consolidate this venture, beginning in the second quarter and expect the venture will generate approximately $1 billion of annual revenues with no material impact to adjusted EBITDA. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank, and we'll open it up for Q&A. We look forward to your questions.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so that we may give as many as possible an opportunity in the queue to ask a question. Rob, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe obviously, there's a lot of positive trends this quarter, both on the volume side, as well as what you're seeing particularly expenses with labor. When you sit here and look at the rest of the year, I know your updated guidance and updated a little further than just the beat in the quarter. What are the variables that you see could swing either more positive or negative? Are there open questions with respect to how labor trends the rest of the year? Or how volume trends the rest of the year? Or maybe some other metric that I'm not highlighting that you see as putting you at different points within the range, or offering variability? Can you maybe flash that out a little further?\nBill Rutherford: Yes. A.J., this is Bill. I'll start and then Sam can add in. I think as we said in our comments, we believe there is momentum that we're seeing in the market. We saw that late \u201822, but we are fortunate that continued into the first quarter. We continue to see good volume expectations in the market. You saw our same-store admissions. Our non-COVID volume was pretty robust, emergency room activity remains busy. So we feel reasonably positive on our volume outlook that we've given. Our revenue per unit, we're pleased with. We're pleased with the payer mix trends in acuity and case mix. They are stable and maintained in the levels that we anticipated. And then on the cost side, we believe the teams have managed cost very well. We knew that labor improved throughout \u201822. Obviously, first quarter of last year was a high mark -- high watermark for us in labor, so we're pleased with where it is today. We hope there's continued improvement to be made, especially around the utilization of contract labor. And so generally, we're feeling pretty good about the cost metrics. There are some inflationary cost trends we're seeing, as I mentioned in other operating that tends to show itself around our professional fees and some of those fixed-cost items that we don't have as much input over. But generally speaking, we think our revised guidance and our outlook reflects our view for the balance of the year.\nA.J. Rice: Okay.\nBill Rutherford: Thanks, A.J.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Securities. Your line is open.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, thanks. I was just wondering if you guys could unpack some of the growth that you're seeing in outpatient surgeries between the ASCs and HOPD, and maybe comment on any particular pockets of strength or weakness across some of those surgical service lines? And it's kind of a corollary to this question two is just the supply cost look very good even with the surgical growth. So if you could maybe elaborate on that dynamic, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Whit, this is Sam, Thank you for your question. We had strong activity in both settings. Our surgical volumes in our hospital outpatient units were up actually slightly more than what was inside of our ambulatory surgery centers. Across all service categories within both settings, we saw really solid volume growth. So it was broad-based, as I mentioned in my comments. We continue to invest in both. We have a more significant investment in our ambulatory surgery center development pipeline with a number of new developments, as well as some possible acquisitions that are complementary to the networks that we have across the company. So we're really pleased with our surgical activity. We are also very pleased with our inpatient surgical activity, as we've seen growth in both our emergency surgeries, as a result of our emergency room activity, as well as elective surgeries across different disciplines. The only category that was down actually our C-sections where we didn't have as much obstetric volume as we did in other parts of our business. And so if you normalize for that dynamic, we were actually up more significantly in the more acute categories of our service lines. So very solid result for us from a surgical volume standpoint. Our supply costs have continued to perform incredibly well. We have a great supply chain capability in our company, and we utilize it to leverage best practices, contracting, logistics, inventory management and so forth. And we continue to maintain even with increased acuity, increased surgical activity, good metrics around our supply cost.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the labor side. I think you said temp labor costs were down 21% year-over-year. Can you confirm that for me? And then just give us a little color in terms of the percentage of hours -- nursing hours that came from temp labor -- you know, temp labor as a percentage of SWB or temp labor as a percentage of SWB dollars. And anything else, kind of, in terms of trends that you're expecting in temp labor through the year that's implied in guidance? Where do you expect to come out-of-the year on some of those metrics? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Thanks, Justin. This is Bill. So yes, I'll confirm, our contract labor was down about 20% year-over-year. And again, we'll continue to be pleased with the trends in there. It's really rooted in the fact that our recruitment is up and turnover is down, so a lot of effort in that front. For the quarter, our contract labor was about 7.1% of our SWB. That compares to about 9.5% last year, and we were running mid-7s through the last half of \u201822, so good trends. You know, as a contract labor as a percent of hours was about 10.3%, where this time last year, we were 11.5%, almost 11.6%. So again, continued improvement in that area, really just rooted by a lot of efforts we have in the recruitment and retention. As we go through the year, we hope we'll continue to see favorable trends in that I hope and we can get in that 6.5% to 7% by the time we finish this year. So a lot of the effort continues by the teams to focus on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBen Hendrix: Thank you. Could you comment a little further on the same-facility revenue per admission and the equivalent admission comps? It looks like maybe lower year-over-year rates in the outpatient volume offset inpatient rate growth. Perhaps you could flush out the dynamics there for the first quarter and how that could play out for the balance of the year. Thank you.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. I'll make a first step, Ben. I think, first, you have to recognize on the year-over-year comparisons, the COVID activity has a significant influence on the year-over-year comparisons. When our COVID emissions went from 9.7% last year to 3%, and COVID revenue per admission runs much higher than our non-COVID, is really influencing the as reported. So why in my prepared remarks, I talked about our non-COVID revenue per admission was 2.2% growth. We've seen sequential improvement in case mix. I think overall, I'd say we're pleased with where the performance is and our acuity in our payer mix and the revenue yield we have when we look at sequentially especially on that. So that was the main thing affecting the as reported, was the COVID volume. When we exclude COVID, we're really pleased with the revenue per unit ramps. Outpatient growth was heavy during the quarter, driven, as we talked about, with the emergency room. So that is influencing the per equivalent admission statistics while we broke down the per admission as well. But again, very pleased with the outpatient growth demand that we're seeing as well as the inpatient. So we're pleased with the top line metrics that we're seeing.\nBen Hendrix: Just as a quick follow-up. Can you parse out the degree to which your -- the acuity that you're seeing is just kind of normalization in terms of admission patterns versus kind of some of the investments you've made to expand your network capabilities? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: It's hard to parse it out. I mean it's all-inclusive. I mean, obviously, with a good surgical volume that we had that helped fuel that. We do continue to see a recovery of demand in the marketplace, but we continue to invest in growing our service offerings and our higher acuity services. So it's hard to parse out and attribute that from one or the other. But both I think are factors and the trends we're seeing.\nSam Hazen: Yes. And Bill, I think it's important to understand that our acuity or our case-mix index, the composite view of that is holding strong and actually up over 2019 when you consider we've lost a really high case mix component in total joint surgery. So I think that speaks to the underlying acuity mix within our remaining inpatient portfolio. We also had total joint surgery growth when you look at inpatient and outpatient again in the quarter. But nonetheless, those cases are now in the outpatient setting and out of our inpatient mix, but yet, we've been able to sustain a really strong acuity mix in total. And that's due to again, program development as Bill alluded to specific efforts in certain markets and certain facilities to advance their clinical capabilities. And it's yielding what we hoped. Next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. One of my favorite expressions is when Sam starts talking about EBITDA clearance rates. So I was disappointed not to hear that catchphrase this morning, but otherwise, really solid quarter. My question is about commercial rate cycle. I think with all the moving parts with COVID, even when we see the Q, it's going to be hard to sort of tease out what's happening there. So just wanted to see if you could just update us on how you're doing on your commercial rate renewals. Is there any material activity on off-cycle renewals? Does this $145 million settlement say anything about the environment in terms of how you're positioned with the payers? Or is it just completely sort of a one-off? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: So, Gary, not to disappoint, our EBITDA clearance in the quarter was 36%. So that's a really good metric for us recognizing operating leverage in the face of really inflation. So it sort of proves the model when we can drive activity into our facilities where we have embedded fixed cost, we're able to turn that into earnings in a very productive way. Again, it speaks to our management team's ability to manage their operations effectively. We're pleased with what's going on in our payer contracting cycles. As we said, we're targeting mid-single-digit increases, and we are achieving that in most circumstances. And I think the payers recognize again the pressures in the marketplace for providers and are allowing, sort of, responsible increases. So we are roughly contracted for 2023. We're 93% of the way there. We're about two-thirds of the way through 2024 and about a quarter of the way through 2025. And at this particular point in time, we're able to maintain the trend that we feel is necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances. The one payer settlement that we talked about, we have processes in place in our Parallon organization, which we believe is a best-in-class revenue cycle capability. And through their efforts and through our support efforts of other components of our business, we were able to resolve some claims that we felt were underpaid in previous years, and those payments were recognized in particular quarter. I don't know that it's reflective of anything in the marketplace other than the specifics around that particular circumstance. I will say that we are focused on making sure that we have the right controls in place, the right relationships in place and the right procedures around ensuring that we get the reimbursement that we have earned. And if there are underpayments or denials that we think are not appropriate, then we will make sure that we work our way through those disputes to get to the answer that we think is appropriate for the company. And I wouldn't say that's anything new necessarily, but it continues to be an ongoing opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Any color on how full-time nurse wage inflation is tracking so far this year versus your expectations? And are you seeing any competitors increase their wages again in 2023? Or is it pretty stable at this point? And on the non-nursing staff, where is that tracking? And can you reflect us on what you assume for nursing and non-nursing wage inflation for 2023 in your guidance?\nSam Hazen: Peto, this is Sam. I think our overall compensation per hour across all aspects of our workforce are trending where we expected them to trend this year. And we're pleased with the progress. And that's in the face of us making some fairly significant increases over the latter part of \u201822, and we continue to make modest increases in certain market circumstances in \u201823, responding to new data or new understandings around what's happening from one market to the other. As I mentioned on our call, our turnover was down. Our nursing turnover was approaching pre-pandemic levels. We were running about 15% -- 14.5% to 15% in 2018 and 2019. We're running about 17%, when you look at the last six months annualized. So a very good trend happening, and we think it's, again, a factor of the macro trends, some of our specific actions around compensation program efforts to really increase resourcing and capabilities for our nurses and other caregivers. So we're really encouraged by the efforts of our teams, the recruitment metrics that we're seeing and where we are competitively in the market. Will there be a market here or there we have to adjust to as we move through the year? Yes. We believe that's factored into our guidance appropriately, and we should be able to manage through those changes as the year progresses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Appreciate taking the question. Could you speak to the increase in CapEx guidance for the year? And I'm curious if you accelerated anything specifically in 1Q as that came in a little bit above where we were thinking? I'm specifically interested in the types of projects that are getting funded and especially the ones that have been that weren't contemplated maybe three months ago? And then lastly, I heard real estate purchases. I'm assuming those are for new inpatient hospital facilities over time.\nSam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam. Thank you for the question. We have a number of communities that we serve where we believe, over time, we're going to need to add to our hospital network, we're obviously adding significantly to our outpatient network. We have approximately 2,500 outpatient facilities that support our 180 or so hospitals across our communities. But we believe that over time, as our communities continue to grow, and we believe that's one of the differentiating attributes of HCA, that are -- we're in great markets that have great growth prospects in and of themselves, before we get to share gain possibilities in those markets, that is going to require us to build out some new hospital facilities. We do have a new hospital opening in -- or under construction in San Antonio -- actually two in San Antonio. As we speak, but San Antonio is one of those markets where we have uniquely high occupancy. That market, for example, we run approximately 90% occupancy, and we think it's better for us to open up new hospitals as opposed to keep adding on in every circumstance in that particular community. But we do own land in Austin, Texas for new hospitals, we own land in Dallas for new hospitals. We just recently purchased in the first quarter land for new hospitals in Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. We have land for new hospitals in a number of Florida markets. So that's part of what you're seeing in our capital spending, is that we are acquiring land for future network development. In addition to that, we have significantly advanced our outpatient facility development. That doesn't put too much pressure on our capital spending, but there are some elements of it that are in the increased guidance. And then finally, I think it's important for everybody to understand, we are still in a situation where we have a lot of facilities that have high levels of occupancy. In the first quarter, the company ran approximately 73% to 74% occupancy in its inpatient facilities. And we need to have sufficient capacity as we build up our staffing over time. We need physical capacity to accommodate what we believe to be the demand for health care. So the projects are really mixed among those three things: land acquisitions for future hospital development; outpatient network development; and then relieving capacity constraints on the existing platform of facilities that we have today.\nBill Rutherford: And Josh, this is Bill. I'll add, we obviously can accommodate that increasing capital within the resources we're generating and within our overall capital allocation philosophies that we have. And we also continue to see really strong returns on invested capital. So we have confidence that these investments will continue to generate growth for us into the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning. Bill, maybe just a question on how we should be thinking about the moving pieces or considerations for the second quarter? I know you called out the envisioned contribution to revenue and then maybe the New Orleans Hospital. But anything that we should be thinking about just sequentially in year-over-year? Thank you.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Brian, nothing material. I mean, once we kind of anniversary the high COVID volume, which is principally first quarter, second quarter of last year, we began to see the start of normalization. Obviously, we're coming off some continued high labor costs in the first quarter. We saw some improvement in the second quarter and obviously improvement as we went through the balance of the year. So I can't say there's anything material, I can call out, especially one quarter to the next. We typically wouldn't do that. But for the balance of the year, now that we've got the majority of the high COVID behind us in terms of the year-over-year comparisons, things should begin to normalize for the most part.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok from UBS. Your line is open.\nAndrew Mok: Hi, good morning. You provided some breakeven metrics on Medicaid redeterminations in the past. Hoping you could provide an updated view on how you expect that to play out over the next 18 to 24 months? And what sort of impact that could have on near and intermediate-term operating results? Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. Thanks. I mean, obviously, this is an area we continue to pay attention to. We've got a fairly formalized approach inside of the company. We haven't seen any impact yet as those redeterminations are just beginning to occur, but we are keeping very close to state plans. We've also made outreach to our Medicaid patients to help them look at alternative coverage in the event they find themselves displaced to Medicaid. We continue to be encouraged with some of the third-party studies that we read that a relatively high percentage of those individuals potentially qualify for employer-sponsored coverage or through enhanced subsidies coverage within the health insurance marketplace. So we are staying very close to that. We are increasing our efforts to help people identify coverage that are available to them, trying to work with states and other community agencies where necessary to help people land coverage. So too early to be able to quantify what the impact of that may be. But ultimately, I believe when people can find coverage in the exchanges or through their employer. We wouldn't really anticipate any material downside, and hopefully, there could be some upside benefit to that over the long run.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Interested if you could talk about how you're thinking about the sustainability of the surgical growth trends over the balance of the year, both in inpatient and outpatient. And interested if -- was there any catch-up just as COVID really diminished in the first quarter? Or do you see those types of growth trends are sustainable over the course of the year?\nBill Rutherford: We're looking -- one, we're pleased with the trends. It's hard to parse exactly the contribution of that. I think overall, we're pleased with the demand and the activity we see in the market. We continue to see -- believe that we're going to return to normal historical volume patterns. And if that does show itself, we should see continued growth in both inpatient and outpatient surgical volume. We continue to invest in our outpatient footprint. That should help drive reasonable outpatient surgical growth. Our program development in the inpatient side should help continue to show good inpatient surgical growth as well. So we'll just have to see that. I think, typically, we would see 1% to 2% type of surgical growth. And as the year goes on, hopefully, we'll continue to see that.\nSam Hazen: Yes. And just to add to that, Bill. I think as we continue to increase our staffing capacity, it also affects our surgical capacity, because we do have instances we're not able to open all of our operating rooms as sufficiently as we would prefer also. And so as our labor situation continues to get better, we think that will allow us to open up more surgical capacity, and we believe the demand in the market is still there. So we're encouraged by where we are with our surgical volumes, and we think we have some things that should prop it up, if you will, as we move through the year with our staffing agenda and our human resource strategies.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: Actually, that's a perfect lead into my question. Could you talk a little bit about your outlook for staff growth? And in particular, obviously, you had the shift from temporary to permanent which has been great. Can you talk about how your staff has grown or maybe registered nurse staff or something like that over the last year? And then as you're looking forward, are there any particular impediments to continued levels of growth?\nSam Hazen: Well, our total headcount was up around 2% when you look at this first quarter against last first quarter, And let me make sure that -- actually, it's more like 3% when you factor out the two lane divestiture. So we're up 3% quarter-over-quarter, which is obviously solid improvement in the market. As we've mentioned in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of last year, we were starting to see some momentum with our hiring, some momentum with our retention programs and so forth. And that's carried through into the first quarter really well. I think our overall hiring was up 13% or something like that. But in the quarter compared to the running average, it was up 19% and that's mostly in nursing. I don't know that it will run that hot as we move through the rest of the year nor will we need it to run that hot as we move through the rest of the year. So our efforts with our recruitment, our efforts with retention will continue. We're encouraged by other programs that we have to support our people and put them in the best position to succeed and deliver high-quality care. We have a significant investment we're making in clinical education. Our Galen School of Nursing continues to grow, and we're really encouraged by what those programs will do for our facilities and our people over time. So those things are all part and parcel to a very comprehensive effort to make sure we have the right amount of staff, they're supplied with the right technology and resources to deliver high-quality care and they can be successful in growing our company. So we're pretty encouraged by where we are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Calvin Sternick from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nCalvin Sternick: Thanks for the questions. Wanted to ask about capacity. I know you said 1.5% for the quarter but still above pre-pandemic levels and labor improving. So just want to get a sense, what are some of the other key variables for getting the declination rate back down to historical levels? And where do you think you can get to by year-end? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: Well, hopefully, we get back to pre-pandemic levels. We benchmarked a lot of our metrics against where we were in 2019, so that we can have a comparison of, sort of, more normalized environment. But obviously, our leverage, and as I just mentioned, is very important to our abilities to open up all of our bed capacity and surgical capacity and so forth. Even in our emergency room capacity sometimes can be constrained, because of staffing levels and such. I think it will continue to get better as we went through the first quarter, March was better than January as an example. So that's a positive trend within the quarter. We're hopeful that, that will sustain itself as we move through the balance of the year. And as we look at some of our hiring and the timing of that hiring, that should line up with some continued improvement as we sequentially move through the year. So those are the main things. Some -- we have capital that will come online over the course of the year, as we always do. That will help in certain circumstances. But I think the most important variable is staff and getting sufficient staff into our facilities, allowing us to open up our beds and so forth appropriately.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So really one main question here. When looking at some of the hospital-related volume commentary from medical device companies over the past week or two, at least one of them suggested from their view that hospital volumes were the strongest in January and February, then normalized in March. And I know no one really likes questions on the monthly performance. So really just my more high-level question is if you could just comment on whether or not the momentum in your overall operations was generally pretty consistent throughout the quarter? And then also, is the full-year \u201823 guidance increase meant to reflect mainly just the upside witnessed in 1Q? And is the rest of the year outlook is generally unchanged from your prior view? Or should we all expect strong momentum from the first quarter to continue into 2Q? Just kind of an all of thoughts around all that for just the overall operations would be helpful. Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Well, again, I think we've seen momentum on there. So yes, the guidance is, I think, is referenced by a few others, principally the performance in the first quarter that we saw. But as we look at volume through the quarter, I think it was pretty consistent on there. We're feeling positive with some of the trends we're seeing, it\u2019s hard to call exactly what may happen and exactly what period they will. But we continue to see good demand in the markets. We continue to add our capacity, continue to be able to serve that. So we think we've incorporated all reasonable assumptions into the guidance going forward. And that's where we stand right now and we'll continue to monitor as the year goes on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nJason Cassorla: Great, thanks. You noted favorable payer mix in the quarter. I was hoping you can give us a sense on commercial -- on core commercial volume growth split out between exchange-related volumes and then just pure commercial. And perhaps if you saw in 1Q or are currently seeing any commercial volume pull forward perhaps ahead of potential coverage changes later this year? Or do you think that commercial volume trend is just more broad-based? Any color on that would be very helpful. Thanks.\nBill Rutherford: Yes. I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, our non-COVID commercial volume was up a little over 11%. So obviously, that's a stat we're very pleased. We're very pleased with the exchange enrollment. We saw really good enrollment across our states. Some of the publicly released data that you've seen, we've seen exchange enrollment in Florida, up 18%, Texas up close to 30%. And that [Technical Difficulty] pretty well with where we would expect exchange volume to be. Our exchange volume just year-over-year was up, what, 19% or so for the quarter. It's hard to make some of those comparisons pure on the non-exchange because COVID has such an impact on that. But if I back up and look at the non-COVID growth of managed care at 11, it is still pretty strong. And even overall, we were up 4%. So again, we're thinking that there's good payer mix will continue, good demand. We still see basically full employment in most of our markets. So we'll see where that plays out. But we are pleased with the health insurance exchange activity that we're seeing across the markets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nSarah James: Thank you. I'm trying to piece together a few of the comments that you made on contract labor. You talked about getting down to about 6.5% to 7% exiting the year. Is that in line with what you've been thinking before? I thought you guys were a little bit lower. And then how do you think about reinvesting the savings of that? So how much is going to wage inflation versus actually increasing headcount? Or is any of it falling to the bottom line as sort of a margin relief?\nBill Rutherford: Well, I mean, there's a lot of moving parts in our labor side. And obviously, our focus has been reducing the utilization of our premium labor, and that has allowed us to continue to invest in our employed workforce. And we continue to invest in our existing employees both through wage rates, as well as hiring that was spoken about earlier on the call. And so when we roll it all up, we kind of look at the overall impact. And yes, we are fortunate that as we've been able to reduce contract labor, that's allowed us to make the investments into our employed workforce. I think that will continue. I think our commentary around our expectations has been reasonably consistent. If you looked at where we ran kind of pre-COVID, it was probably in that 6% range. We think we can continue to make progress on that. So it's fairly consistent. But again, we are investing much of the benefit of contract labor back into our existing employees.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on another question. You mentioned having a pretty decent amount of visibility on 2024 contracting at this point. I mean, can you just remind us how the two-thirds, compared to where you might have been in a more typical pre-COVID environment? And I think you also alluded that the commercial rate dynamics continuing to be acknowledged by payers at the same general magnitude. Just want to confirm if that was what you meant by those comments? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: I'm not sure I understood the second part of that question. But the first part of the question, we're, like I said, running mid-single-digits on our renewed contracts. We were running 3.5 or so prepandemic with our commercial contracting. So it is up a little bit. Again, it's reflective of, I think, the overall inflationary environment that most organizations find themselves. But we think it's a responsible ask and it's been received reasonably well by the payers that we've renewed. What was the second question?\nBill Rutherford: Well, I think the other one was around the percentage of our contracts that are completed for '24? Is it consistent with where its historical.\nSam Hazen: Oh, yes, it is.\nBill Rutherford: And if it is consistent with where we would have historically been.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJamie Perse: Hey, thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question about the procedure shift to outpatient. First, can you help us quantify what the headwind from that shift has been to revenue and EBITDA over the last couple of years? And then two, categories like knees and hips, so a little bit more homogenous, how do we think about the shift of categories like cardiology? You mentioned that was up 7% in the outpatient setting in the quarter. Are there big categories in cardiology that are analogous to total joints that you think are a big category that is amenable to that shift out patients that we should be thinking about impacting the transition in the near-term? Thank you.\nSam Hazen: We don't see any particular procedural category facing the same type of pressure as total joints did. I think our company is somewhere around 80% of our total joints today are done as an outpatient with 20% done as an inpatient. That was reversed pre-pandemic. So we've absorbed all of that. And it was a headwind with respect to a P&L impact over this time period. The rest of the categories are not as discrete as total joints. And in cardiac, particularly, a large piece of our cardiac volumes today are already in the outpatient setting. And so we don't anticipate anything in that particular category shifting like total joints have shifted. We've seen some shift over time in spine, and that's more incremental than it is holistic like total joints. We've seen some in cardiac over the years. We've seen some with our robotics platform. Those continue, sort of, on the margin. They're not structurally repositioning like total joints did. And so our company has effectively navigated that transition. Again, we have a multifaceted offering for patients and physicians, both in our facilities, outpatient within our facilities, ambulatory surgery centers so forth. And that's -- one of those settings is the right setting for just about every patient. And I think our organization has been able to grow as a result of that multifaceted offering. And our total joints, like I said earlier, are actually up year-over-year and they were up last year, compared to the previous year, so we've seen good growth in our orthopedic programs, and we continue to work with our surgeons and our service line leaders to advance our capabilities as well.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Frank Morgan. I turn the call back over to you for some final closing remarks.\nFrank Morgan: Rob, thank you for your help today, and thanks for everyone for joining the call. We hope you have a great weekend. I'm around this afternoon. If we can answer any additional questions you might have for this. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rutherford",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $3.17 billion, as compared to $2.94 billion in the prior year. As noted in our release, in the first quarter of this year, we recorded an increase in revenues of $145 million related to resolving certain disputed claims with a commercial payer that covered a six-year period. In the prior year quarter, we recorded an additional $244 million of revenues and $90 million of expenses that related to the Texas directed payment program for an earlier period. I will also note, as it relates to prior year comparisons, we still were experiencing high level of COVID volumes in the first quarter of 2022. COVID admissions accounted for 9.7% of admissions last year, compared to about 3% this year. In addition, in the prior year quarter, we recognized approximately $190 million of COVID-related support payments versus about $30 million in this year's first quarter. Sam highlighted our positive volume metrics in the quarter and this was coupled with good payer mix and case mix trends. Same facility managed care and other admissions grew 4.2% during the quarter, when compared to the prior year and non-COVID managed care admissions grew 11.3% versus the prior year. Non-COVID case mix improved just under 1%, as compared to both prior year and sequentially from the fourth quarter. This contributed to our non-COVID inpatient revenue per admission increasing 2.2%, as compared to the first quarter of last year. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating cost even with the backdrop of higher inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.3% in the quarter. Labor cost as a percentage of revenue improved both sequentially and when compared to the prior year and our supply costs continue to trend favorably as well. We have discussed previously other operating expenses have been subject to some inflationary cost pressures and increased approximately 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue, when compared to the prior year. So let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics as they remain a key part of our long-term growth and value creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations increased $458 million in the quarter from $1.35 billion in the prior year to $1.8 billion this year. Capital spending was just under $1.2 billion. We paid $175 million in dividends and repurchased just under $850 million of our stock during the quarter. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3 times to 4 times. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full-year 2023 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $62.5 billion and $64.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.75 billion and $5.16 billion. We expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.1 billion and $12.7 billion. And we expect full-year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.25 and $18.55. And lastly, we expect capital spending to approximate $4.6 billion during the year. I will mention that our updated capital spending guidance is based on opportunities we believe exist to continue to invest growth agenda, and it also considers some land acquisitions we are planning for future development. In addition, we are seeing some inflationary increases in construction costs that we have factored into our guidance as well. Finally, I will mention, in early April, we closed on a transaction to increase our ownership interest in the Valesco joint venture with Envision. We will consolidate this venture, beginning in the second quarter and expect the venture will generate approximately $1 billion of annual revenues with no material impact to adjusted EBITDA. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank, and we'll open it up for Q&A. We look forward to your questions. Yes. A.J., this is Bill. I'll start and then Sam can add in. I think as we said in our comments, we believe there is momentum that we're seeing in the market. We saw that late \u201822, but we are fortunate that continued into the first quarter. We continue to see good volume expectations in the market. You saw our same-store admissions. Our non-COVID volume was pretty robust, emergency room activity remains busy. So we feel reasonably positive on our volume outlook that we've given. Our revenue per unit, we're pleased with. We're pleased with the payer mix trends in acuity and case mix. They are stable and maintained in the levels that we anticipated. And then on the cost side, we believe the teams have managed cost very well. We knew that labor improved throughout \u201822. Obviously, first quarter of last year was a high mark -- high watermark for us in labor, so we're pleased with where it is today. We hope there's continued improvement to be made, especially around the utilization of contract labor. And so generally, we're feeling pretty good about the cost metrics. There are some inflationary cost trends we're seeing, as I mentioned in other operating that tends to show itself around our professional fees and some of those fixed-cost items that we don't have as much input over. But generally speaking, we think our revised guidance and our outlook reflects our view for the balance of the year. Thanks, A.J. Yes. Thanks, Justin. This is Bill. So yes, I'll confirm, our contract labor was down about 20% year-over-year. And again, we'll continue to be pleased with the trends in there. It's really rooted in the fact that our recruitment is up and turnover is down, so a lot of effort in that front. For the quarter, our contract labor was about 7.1% of our SWB. That compares to about 9.5% last year, and we were running mid-7s through the last half of \u201822, so good trends. You know, as a contract labor as a percent of hours was about 10.3%, where this time last year, we were 11.5%, almost 11.6%. So again, continued improvement in that area, really just rooted by a lot of efforts we have in the recruitment and retention. As we go through the year, we hope we'll continue to see favorable trends in that I hope and we can get in that 6.5% to 7% by the time we finish this year. So a lot of the effort continues by the teams to focus on that. Yes. I'll make a first step, Ben. I think, first, you have to recognize on the year-over-year comparisons, the COVID activity has a significant influence on the year-over-year comparisons. When our COVID emissions went from 9.7% last year to 3%, and COVID revenue per admission runs much higher than our non-COVID, is really influencing the as reported. So why in my prepared remarks, I talked about our non-COVID revenue per admission was 2.2% growth. We've seen sequential improvement in case mix. I think overall, I'd say we're pleased with where the performance is and our acuity in our payer mix and the revenue yield we have when we look at sequentially especially on that. So that was the main thing affecting the as reported, was the COVID volume. When we exclude COVID, we're really pleased with the revenue per unit ramps. Outpatient growth was heavy during the quarter, driven, as we talked about, with the emergency room. So that is influencing the per equivalent admission statistics while we broke down the per admission as well. But again, very pleased with the outpatient growth demand that we're seeing as well as the inpatient. So we're pleased with the top line metrics that we're seeing. It's hard to parse it out. I mean it's all-inclusive. I mean, obviously, with a good surgical volume that we had that helped fuel that. We do continue to see a recovery of demand in the marketplace, but we continue to invest in growing our service offerings and our higher acuity services. So it's hard to parse out and attribute that from one or the other. But both I think are factors and the trends we're seeing. And Josh, this is Bill. I'll add, we obviously can accommodate that increasing capital within the resources we're generating and within our overall capital allocation philosophies that we have. And we also continue to see really strong returns on invested capital. So we have confidence that these investments will continue to generate growth for us into the future. Yes. Brian, nothing material. I mean, once we kind of anniversary the high COVID volume, which is principally first quarter, second quarter of last year, we began to see the start of normalization. Obviously, we're coming off some continued high labor costs in the first quarter. We saw some improvement in the second quarter and obviously improvement as we went through the balance of the year. So I can't say there's anything material, I can call out, especially one quarter to the next. We typically wouldn't do that. But for the balance of the year, now that we've got the majority of the high COVID behind us in terms of the year-over-year comparisons, things should begin to normalize for the most part. Yes. Thanks. I mean, obviously, this is an area we continue to pay attention to. We've got a fairly formalized approach inside of the company. We haven't seen any impact yet as those redeterminations are just beginning to occur, but we are keeping very close to state plans. We've also made outreach to our Medicaid patients to help them look at alternative coverage in the event they find themselves displaced to Medicaid. We continue to be encouraged with some of the third-party studies that we read that a relatively high percentage of those individuals potentially qualify for employer-sponsored coverage or through enhanced subsidies coverage within the health insurance marketplace. So we are staying very close to that. We are increasing our efforts to help people identify coverage that are available to them, trying to work with states and other community agencies where necessary to help people land coverage. So too early to be able to quantify what the impact of that may be. But ultimately, I believe when people can find coverage in the exchanges or through their employer. We wouldn't really anticipate any material downside, and hopefully, there could be some upside benefit to that over the long run. We're looking -- one, we're pleased with the trends. It's hard to parse exactly the contribution of that. I think overall, we're pleased with the demand and the activity we see in the market. We continue to see -- believe that we're going to return to normal historical volume patterns. And if that does show itself, we should see continued growth in both inpatient and outpatient surgical volume. We continue to invest in our outpatient footprint. That should help drive reasonable outpatient surgical growth. Our program development in the inpatient side should help continue to show good inpatient surgical growth as well. So we'll just have to see that. I think, typically, we would see 1% to 2% type of surgical growth. And as the year goes on, hopefully, we'll continue to see that. Well, again, I think we've seen momentum on there. So yes, the guidance is, I think, is referenced by a few others, principally the performance in the first quarter that we saw.

We continue to add our capacity, continue to be able to serve that. So we think we've incorporated all reasonable assumptions into the guidance going forward. And that's where we stand right now and we'll continue to monitor as the year goes on. Yes. I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, our non-COVID commercial volume was up a little over 11%. So obviously, that's a stat we're very pleased. We're very pleased with the exchange enrollment. We saw really good enrollment across our states. Some of the publicly released data that you've seen, we've seen exchange enrollment in Florida, up 18%, Texas up close to 30%. And that [Technical Difficulty] pretty well with where we would expect exchange volume to be. Our exchange volume just year-over-year was up, what, 19% or so for the quarter. It's hard to make some of those comparisons pure on the non-exchange because COVID has such an impact on that. But if I back up and look at the non-COVID growth of managed care at 11, it is still pretty strong. And even overall, we were up 4%. So again, we're thinking that there's good payer mix will continue, good demand. We still see basically full employment in most of our markets. So we'll see where that plays out. But we are pleased with the health insurance exchange activity that we're seeing across the markets. Well, I mean, there's a lot of moving parts in our labor side.

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "Alright. Thank you, Frank, and good morning. Thank you for joining our call. The operational momentum we had at the end of the last year continued into the first quarter of 2023. The company produced solid earnings that reflected strong demand for our services and improvements in our operating costs in particular contract labor expenses. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share excluding losses on sales of facilities grew by almost 20% to $4.93. Adjusted EBITDA grew close to 8%. Same facility volumes across the company were strong in the first quarter, admissions grew 4.4% year-over-year. Non-COVID admissions were up 12%. Our inpatient business continued to be supported by strong acuity and a favorable payer mix. Inpatient surgeries increased 3.6%. Same facility equivalent admissions increased 7.5%. This was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 10% and outpatient surgeries, which grew 5%. Other outpatient categories also grew including outpatient cardiology procedures, which increased 7%. The demand increase was broad-based across most of the company's footprint and service lines contributing to same facility revenue growth of 5%, as compared to the prior year. With respect to our people agenda, we saw continued improvements across virtually all metrics. The improvement in turnover rates accelerated from the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter close to pre-pandemic levels. Registered nurse hiring also improved in the quarter. Hiring increased almost 19%, compared to the previous four quarter average. These positive results helped reduce contract labor cost 21%, compared to last year. We continue to invest in our people through compensation programs, increased training and innovative care models. We believe these programs advanced our capabilities to provide high quality care to our patients. Once again, our colleagues demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt and deliver value across all stakeholder groups. I want to thank them for their dedication, their hard work, and their overall effectiveness. During the quarter, we continued to experience periodic capacity constraints that prevented us from fully operating our capacity. As compared to the fourth quarter, instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined 25% and represented 1.5% of total admissions in the quarter, which was down from 2% in the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with this improved trend it still remains above pre-pandemic levels. Close with this, we remain encouraged by the backdrop of strong demand that we saw in our markets. We intend to maintain our disciplined approach to executing our strategic and capital allocation plans as we push through the rest of this year. And lastly, we believe the investments we are making in our network, our people and our technology will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our services and provide high quality care to our patients. Given the strong results in the quarter and the favorable factors we expect with demand, you will see that we have increased our guidance for the year. With that, I'll turn the call to Bill for more details. Whit, this is Sam, Thank you for your question. We had strong activity in both settings. Our surgical volumes in our hospital outpatient units were up actually slightly more than what was inside of our ambulatory surgery centers. Across all service categories within both settings, we saw really solid volume growth. So it was broad-based, as I mentioned in my comments. We continue to invest in both. We have a more significant investment in our ambulatory surgery center development pipeline with a number of new developments, as well as some possible acquisitions that are complementary to the networks that we have across the company. So we're really pleased with our surgical activity. We are also very pleased with our inpatient surgical activity, as we've seen growth in both our emergency surgeries, as a result of our emergency room activity, as well as elective surgeries across different disciplines. The only category that was down actually our C-sections where we didn't have as much obstetric volume as we did in other parts of our business. And so if you normalize for that dynamic, we were actually up more significantly in the more acute categories of our service lines. So very solid result for us from a surgical volume standpoint. Our supply costs have continued to perform incredibly well. We have a great supply chain capability in our company, and we utilize it to leverage best practices, contracting, logistics, inventory management and so forth. And we continue to maintain even with increased acuity, increased surgical activity, good metrics around our supply cost. Yes. And Bill, I think it's important to understand that our acuity or our case-mix index, the composite view of that is holding strong and actually up over 2019 when you consider we've lost a really high case mix component in total joint surgery. So I think that speaks to the underlying acuity mix within our remaining inpatient portfolio. We also had total joint surgery growth when you look at inpatient and outpatient again in the quarter. But nonetheless, those cases are now in the outpatient setting and out of our inpatient mix, but yet, we've been able to sustain a really strong acuity mix in total. And that's due to again, program development as Bill alluded to specific efforts in certain markets and certain facilities to advance their clinical capabilities. And it's yielding what we hoped. Next question? So, Gary, not to disappoint, our EBITDA clearance in the quarter was 36%. So that's a really good metric for us recognizing operating leverage in the face of really inflation. So it sort of proves the model when we can drive activity into our facilities where we have embedded fixed cost, we're able to turn that into earnings in a very productive way. Again, it speaks to our management team's ability to manage their operations effectively. We're pleased with what's going on in our payer contracting cycles. As we said, we're targeting mid-single-digit increases, and we are achieving that in most circumstances. And I think the payers recognize again the pressures in the marketplace for providers and are allowing, sort of, responsible increases. So we are roughly contracted for 2023. We're 93% of the way there. We're about two-thirds of the way through 2024 and about a quarter of the way through 2025. And at this particular point in time, we're able to maintain the trend that we feel is necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances. The one payer settlement that we talked about, we have processes in place in our Parallon organization, which we believe is a best-in-class revenue cycle capability. And through their efforts and through our support efforts of other components of our business, we were able to resolve some claims that we felt were underpaid in previous years, and those payments were recognized in particular quarter. I don't know that it's reflective of anything in the marketplace other than the specifics around that particular circumstance. I will say that we are focused on making sure that we have the right controls in place, the right relationships in place and the right procedures around ensuring that we get the reimbursement that we have earned. And if there are underpayments or denials that we think are not appropriate, then we will make sure that we work our way through those disputes to get to the answer that we think is appropriate for the company. And I wouldn't say that's anything new necessarily, but it continues to be an ongoing opportunity. Peto, this is Sam. I think our overall compensation per hour across all aspects of our workforce are trending where we expected them to trend this year. And we're pleased with the progress. And that's in the face of us making some fairly significant increases over the latter part of \u201822, and we continue to make modest increases in certain market circumstances in \u201823, responding to new data or new understandings around what's happening from one market to the other. As I mentioned on our call, our turnover was down. Our nursing turnover was approaching pre-pandemic levels. We were running about 15% -- 14.5% to 15% in 2018 and 2019. We're running about 17%, when you look at the last six months annualized. So a very good trend happening, and we think it's, again, a factor of the macro trends, some of our specific actions around compensation program efforts to really increase resourcing and capabilities for our nurses and other caregivers. So we're really encouraged by the efforts of our teams, the recruitment metrics that we're seeing and where we are competitively in the market. Will there be a market here or there we have to adjust to as we move through the year? Yes. We believe that's factored into our guidance appropriately, and we should be able to manage through those changes as the year progresses. Yes. This is Sam. Thank you for the question. We have a number of communities that we serve where we believe, over time, we're going to need to add to our hospital network, we're obviously adding significantly to our outpatient network. We have approximately 2,500 outpatient facilities that support our 180 or so hospitals across our communities. But we believe that over time, as our communities continue to grow, and we believe that's one of the differentiating attributes of HCA, that are -- we're in great markets that have great growth prospects in and of themselves, before we get to share gain possibilities in those markets, that is going to require us to build out some new hospital facilities. We do have a new hospital opening in -- or under construction in San Antonio -- actually two in San Antonio. As we speak, but San Antonio is one of those markets where we have uniquely high occupancy. That market, for example, we run approximately 90% occupancy, and we think it's better for us to open up new hospitals as opposed to keep adding on in every circumstance in that particular community. But we do own land in Austin, Texas for new hospitals, we own land in Dallas for new hospitals. We just recently purchased in the first quarter land for new hospitals in Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. We have land for new hospitals in a number of Florida markets. So that's part of what you're seeing in our capital spending, is that we are acquiring land for future network development. In addition to that, we have significantly advanced our outpatient facility development. That doesn't put too much pressure on our capital spending, but there are some elements of it that are in the increased guidance. And then finally, I think it's important for everybody to understand, we are still in a situation where we have a lot of facilities that have high levels of occupancy. In the first quarter, the company ran approximately 73% to 74% occupancy in its inpatient facilities. And we need to have sufficient capacity as we build up our staffing over time. We need physical capacity to accommodate what we believe to be the demand for health care. So the projects are really mixed among those three things: land acquisitions for future hospital development; outpatient network development; and then relieving capacity constraints on the existing platform of facilities that we have today. Yes. And just to add to that, Bill. I think as we continue to increase our staffing capacity, it also affects our surgical capacity, because we do have instances we're not able to open all of our operating rooms as sufficiently as we would prefer also. And so as our labor situation continues to get better, we think that will allow us to open up more surgical capacity, and we believe the demand in the market is still there. So we're encouraged by where we are with our surgical volumes, and we think we have some things that should prop it up, if you will, as we move through the year with our staffing agenda and our human resource strategies. Well, our total headcount was up around 2% when you look at this first quarter against last first quarter, And let me make sure that -- actually, it's more like 3% when you factor out the two lane divestiture. So we're up 3% quarter-over-quarter, which is obviously solid improvement in the market. As we've mentioned in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of last year, we were starting to see some momentum with our hiring, some momentum with our retention programs and so forth. And that's carried through into the first quarter really well. I think our overall hiring was up 13% or something like that. But in the quarter compared to the running average, it was up 19% and that's mostly in nursing. I don't know that it will run that hot as we move through the rest of the year nor will we need it to run that hot as we move through the rest of the year. So our efforts with our recruitment, our efforts with retention will continue. We're encouraged by other programs that we have to support our people and put them in the best position to succeed and deliver high-quality care. We have a significant investment we're making in clinical education. Our Galen School of Nursing continues to grow, and we're really encouraged by what those programs will do for our facilities and our people over time. So those things are all part and parcel to a very comprehensive effort to make sure we have the right amount of staff, they're supplied with the right technology and resources to deliver high-quality care and they can be successful in growing our company. So we're pretty encouraged by where we are. Well, hopefully, we get back to pre-pandemic levels. We benchmarked a lot of our metrics against where we were in 2019, so that we can have a comparison of, sort of, more normalized environment. But obviously, our leverage, and as I just mentioned, is very important to our abilities to open up all of our bed capacity and surgical capacity and so forth. Even in our emergency room capacity sometimes can be constrained, because of staffing levels and such. I think it will continue to get better as we went through the first quarter, March was better than January as an example. So that's a positive trend within the quarter. We're hopeful that, that will sustain itself as we move through the balance of the year. And as we look at some of our hiring and the timing of that hiring, that should line up with some continued improvement as we sequentially move through the year. So those are the main things. Some -- we have capital that will come online over the course of the year, as we always do. That will help in certain circumstances. But I think the most important variable is staff and getting sufficient staff into our facilities, allowing us to open up our beds and so forth appropriately. I'm not sure I understood the second part of that question. But the first part of the question, we're, like I said, running mid-single-digits on our renewed contracts. We were running 3.5 or so prepandemic with our commercial contracting. So it is up a little bit. Again, it's reflective of, I think, the overall inflationary environment that most organizations find themselves. But we think it's a responsible ask and it's been received reasonably well by the payers that we've renewed. What was the second question? Oh, yes, it is. We don't see any particular procedural category facing the same type of pressure as total joints did. I think our company is somewhere around 80% of our total joints today are done as an outpatient with 20% done as an inpatient. That was reversed pre-pandemic. So we've absorbed all of that. And it was a headwind with respect to a P&L impact over this time period. The rest of the categories are not as discrete as total joints. And in cardiac, particularly, a large piece of our cardiac volumes today are already in the outpatient setting. And so we don't anticipate anything in that particular category shifting like total joints have shifted. We've seen some shift over time in spine, and that's more incremental than it is holistic like total joints. We've seen some in cardiac over the years. We've seen some with our robotics platform. Those continue, sort of, on the margin. They're not structurally repositioning like total joints did. And so our company has effectively navigated that transition. Again, we have a multifaceted offering for patients and physicians, both in our facilities, outpatient within our facilities, ambulatory surgery centers so forth. And that's -- one of those settings is the right setting for just about every patient. And I think our organization has been able to grow as a result of that multifaceted offering. And our total joints, like I said earlier, are actually up year-over-year and they were up last year, compared to the previous year, so we've seen good growth in our orthopedic programs, and we continue to work with our surgeons and our service line leaders to advance our capabilities as well."

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and CFO, Mike Marks. Sam and Mike will provide some prepared remarks and then we'll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA shareholder Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: Hi, good morning to everybody. Before we get to the financial results for the quarter, I want to share the heroic efforts of our people as they recently responded to, in less than two weeks, two major hurricanes that impacted some of our communities and facilities. Over the years, HCA Healthcare has developed industry-leading enterprise capabilities to support our hospitals during disasters. We have used learnings from past experiences, conducted extensive training, and built strong partnerships with key vendors to create a systematic approach to preparing for and responding to major events like hurricanes. These resources were put to use by our teams with outstanding results over these past few weeks as enough hospitals were in the path of these storms. But what's even more impressive is the unwavering dedication, remarkable bravery, and outstanding leadership demonstrated by the people in our company who worked throughout these storms and, in many instances, multiple days without rest to ensure our patients and colleagues were safe. Leveraging corporate capabilities effectively to support committed people in our facilities is fundamentally our formula for success. We call it the HCA way. It works well in normal times, it worked well in the pandemic, and now it has proven itself again in these hurricanes. A few of our communities were significantly impacted by these storms. This is especially evident in the Asheville area and parts of Tampa-St. Pete. Given the basic infrastructure role we play in our communities and the duty we have to be there for them in each situations, we have not veered from doing the right thing. I'm humbled by the determination and teamwork of HCA people. I'm honored to be associated with them and I'm proud of how they continually show up in difficult circumstances and deliver tremendously positive outcomes for our patients, each other, and their communities. They truly demonstrate that they are, above all else, committed to the care and improvement of human life, and I want to thank them for what they do to make this company great. Now to the quarter's results. Like the first half of the year, the results for the third quarter were strong and reflected solid revenue growth and margin improvement. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, increased 25% to $4.90. These results include an estimated impact of $0.15 per share from lost revenue and additional expenses caused by Hurricane Helene. While the rest of our hospitals and outpatient facilities in the path of the storms are fully operational, we have two hospitals that continue to deal with the aftereffects of the storms. First, HCA Mission Hospital, which is the only hospital in the Asheville area, was affected by Hurricane Helene and it has continued to operate and provide high quality patient care, even with significant city infrastructure in disrepair, and that's primarily water. As a consequence of this storm, we anticipate incurring significant expenses and lost revenue related to these issues throughout the remainder of the year. We also expect some continued, but we think manageable, impact into 2025. As it pertains to Hurricane Milton, which hit Florida in October, our HCA Florida Largo Hospital was flooded. It is currently closed because of damage to the building's infrastructure. We anticipate significant repair expenses will be incurred at this hospital during the fourth quarter, in addition to losing revenue. Our teams, however, are working around the clock to reopen it in late December. HCA Healthcare has numerous examples from past hurricanes where our hospitals have recovered from major storms and become more productive than pre-storm performance. I believe we can produce similar results with these two hospitals in time as we move beyond the aftereffects of these most recent storms. During the quarter, volume growth across our markets and service lines, while modestly affected by Hurricane Helene, was strong and broad based. On a same facilities basis, inpatient admissions grew 4.5% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted admissions also grew 4.5%. Emergency room visits increased 4.6%. Inpatient surgeries were up 1.6%. Other volume categories, including cardiac procedures, inpatient rehab admissions, and obstetric volumes had solid growth. Outpatient surgery was the only major service category that declined. It was down 2%. However, the revenue in this service line increased 5% because of acuity and payer mix. Payer mix across other service lines and acuity within inpatient services improved in the quarter. These factors helped generate same facilities revenue growth of 7.1%. We continue to believe the investments we are making in our network development agenda drive value for our patients and the organization. By the end of this year, we expect to have added approximately 600 inpatient beds and 100 new outpatient facilities, bringing our total sites of care to over 2,600. Currently, the company has around $6 billion of projects under development. These investments, which should come online over the next few years will add more capacity and create greater access across our networks, allowing us to meet the growing demand for healthcare services we anticipate in our markets. Before I turn the call to Mike, I want to close with a few early thoughts on 2025. Our planning process, which includes continuing assessments of the hurricane-related impact, has not been completed. So I will caveat my comments with the fact that it is always difficult to predict with certainty the various components of our business, and these preliminary views may change. With respect to volume, we went into this year believing that growth would exceed our long-term demand assumptions of 2% to 3%, and throughout the year it has. As we look to 2025, we assume volume growth will continue at elevated levels in the range of 3% to 4% for the year. With respect to our earnings outlook for next year, we believe that the strong volume growth assumption, coupled with an anticipated mostly stable operating environment, should generate earnings growth near or slightly above the upper end of our long-term target ranges for both diluted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA. As usual, in January, we will provide you with our guidance for 2025. And with that, I'll turn the call to Mike.\nMike Marks: Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with the third quarter. We produced good volume growth and margins, especially when considering the impact of the hurricanes. I'll start with a few details of the two storms that impacted us recently. Hurricane Helene made landfall in the Big Bend area of Florida on September 26th and impacted our communities and operations in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. We had 29 hospitals in the path of the storm which had to prepare and respond. And financially, we have seen a loss of revenue and incurred additional expenses during the preparation, during storm, and the response phases. As an example, we are expecting to spend at least $13 million on water supply to Mission Hospital and our other health care facilities related to Hurricane Helene through the month of October. And city potable water supply is not projected to be re-established at Mission Hospital for several more weeks. As Sam noted, we estimate that Hurricane Helene impacted the third quarter by $50 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Hurricane Milton hit the west coast of Florida just south of Sarasota on October 9 and impacted a large portion of the Florida peninsula. We had over 34 hospitals in the path of this storm that had to prepare and respond, including HCA Florida Largo Hospital, which is still under repair. As we think about the ongoing impacts of both major hurricanes, we anticipate additional expenses and loss of revenue will be approximately $200 million to $300 million or $0.60 to $0.90 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2024. This impact relates primarily to our hospitals in North Carolina and our Largo Hospital in Florida. These estimates do not include any insurance recoveries the company may receive in the future. I would like to add my appreciation to our care teams and all the HCA colleagues who provided support during these storms and my concern and prayers for the communities and the people impacted as we collectively recover and respond. It is a true honor to work with our colleagues and our physicians and to serve these communities. Now let me transition to our 2024 guidance. As noted in our release, we reaffirmed our 2024 estimated guidance ranges. Given the ongoing impact of the two major hurricanes on the remainder of the year, we estimate that the results are likely to be in the lower half of the ranges provided. Now to the results for the quarter. Sam reviewed our strong volumes, which resulted in revenue growth of 7.9% in the quarter over prior year. So I will focus on operating costs in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter improved 90 basis points over prior year. Labor cost as a percent of revenue improved 160 basis points from the prior year. We continued to see good results on contract labor, which improved 18% from the prior year and represented 4.6% of total labor cost. Supply cost as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points over the prior year but were relatively consistent sequentially. Other operating cost as a percent of revenue increased 40 basis points over the prior year. Professional fee cost growth over prior year moderated to 10% and was flat sequentially to the second quarter. We had expense growth associated with Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs and we had increased repair maintenance costs related to Hurricane Helene. Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs provided a modest benefit to our third quarter '24 overall results. So a lot of movement parts in the quarter, but this was a solid quarter with over 13% growth in adjusted EBITDA driven by strong core operating performance across our portfolio of markets. Moving to capital allocation, we continued to deploy a balanced strategy of allocating capital for long-term value creation. Cash flow from operations was $3.5 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled 1.19 billion and we repurchased 1.79 billion of our outstanding shares during the quarter. We also paid 169 million in dividends. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage remains at the low end of our stated guidance range and we believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective. Finally, as noted in our release, we now estimate capital expenditures for 2024 to be approximately $5 billion. This lower estimate is due primarily to the timing of capital projects and we continue to see good opportunities for investing in our business. With that, Frank, I will turn over the call to you for questions.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Mike. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so we have as many as possible in the queue an opportunity to ask a question. Jeremy, you may now give instructions to those who'd like to ask a question.\nOperator: Perfect, thank you so much. [Operator Instructions]. All right, the first question comes from the line of AJ Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAJ Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Just maybe one point of clarification and then a question. So on the outlook comments for 2025, if we take the mid-2024 guidance, 14 billion, and take 250 to 350 million of hurricane impact off of that and then grow at the high end of your 4% to 6% range, we'd come up with something like 14.6 billion for 2025 and then we'd layer in hurricane recovery on top of that. I just want to make sure we're all walking away with the right framework. Is that what you're saying? And then my broader question, just to throw that out, would be on your volume strength. You now have anniversaries to pick up in volume post-pandemic we saw last year. Are there particular areas of service lines that are remaining strong that are worth calling out even as you anniversary what was strong trends last year?\nMike Marks: Thanks, AJ. This is Mike. As it relates to our 2025 commentary, let me say this. We generally believe that the ongoing effects of the hurricanes in 2025, which we, as Sam said, we think are manageable, will be primarily in North Carolina as we expect our Tampa facility to be operational by the end of 2024. And we took these storms and the potential lingering effects into 2025 into account when we set this being near or slightly above the upper end of our long-term growth range. As Sam noted as well, we will give much more context and details on our 2025 formal guidance in January. As it relates to volume, the only thing I might point in addition to the point that you made relative to, you know, strong volume pickups in the last part of last year, is that sequentially from Q2 to Q3 of 2024, we increased same facility admissions by 1.4%. And that sequential increase is in line with our past sequential trend. So, that's our sense of volume.\nSam Hazen: Yes, and let me add to that, AJ. I think, broadly, most of our service categories are growing really well. And we think the emergency room continues to be a very important solution for people in our communities. And it continues to grow and we continue to invest in it. And we continue to improve our patient outcomes with our ER optimization agenda. We continue to see good strength in our cardiac business broadly across the organization. And as I said, in terms of the geography of the company, we've had broad-based growth as well with very few challenges, if you will across the important markets of our company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: A lot of discussion this earnings season around claim denial activity. I was wondering if you could touch on denial trends broadly. And then related to 2 midnight claims specifically, back in July, you noted that you were just beginning to see adjudication of 2 midnight related claims from early in the year. As we approach year end, can you offer any observations on the adjudication activity you're seeing around 2 midnight? And is there anything informing your view of when we may see behavioral changes among payers and how they process those short-stay admissions? Thank you.\nMike Marks: Good morning, Ben. Thank you. Let me talk about denials generally first and then we'll pivot to midnight impact in the quarter. Ben, as we noted in our Investor Day, we have been working diligently on denial mitigation strategies through our integrated revenue cycle over the past several years. We certainly have seen payers ramp up the intensity level of their denial activities over the past several years. But given our focus and investment in these areas, we've been able to moderate the rate of growth in denial write-offs this year from prior year. So, denials were not a material impact to HCA in third quarter of 2024. A quick update on the Medicare to Medicare Advantage 2 midnight rule adoption. Our same facility total Medicare admissions increased 5.3% in the quarter. Traditional Medicare admits were basically flat. Medicare Advantage admissions were up 11% and we attribute approximately 2% of that 11% growth in Medicare Advantage admissions coming from the 2 midnight rule impact. This is equivalent to approximately 50 basis points of our overall admission growth and has remained consistent over the year. As we continue, as I think about the denial impact to your question on the 2 midnight rule, we do continue to see a modest reduction in the prior authorization denial trends for accounts with 2 midnights or greater compared to prior year so far in 2024. But we still have way too many denials. And we have a few large Medicare Advantage payers that are significant outliers driving these denials. For context, let me highlight a couple of comparisons of Medicare Advantage to traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage now represents 58% of total Medicare volume. The mix of observation to inpatients with Medicare Advantage is still significantly higher than traditional Medicare. Even now, nine months past the implementation of the 2 midnight rule. Lastly, the Medicare Advantage CMI adjusted length of stay ratio is approximately 10% higher than traditional Medicare, driven by payer-driven discharge delays. These drive cost burdens to providers. So as we're working with our Medicare Advantage payers, we're really trying to address two things. We're trying to address this denial burden and the cost burden. And so as you think about the adjudication process, we are starting to get, through the first quarters, denials all the way through the adjudication process. And now we are pursuing those through dispute resolution. As we've talked about before, dispute resolution can take a year to two years to fully complete. And so we are going to have to continue to pursue that strategy as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Hynes from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, this is Ann. Thank you. I guess part of my question you just addressed, when I think about pricing assumptions for 2025, when I think ahead, I'm assuming it might be a tough compare because you have this 2 midnight rule this year. You also had a nice shift from Medicaid to commercial next year and had some incremental DPP. So when we think of pricing next year, maybe in your initial guide, what do you have for maybe a benefit for a continued shift to this observation to inpatient status on the Medicare Advantage side? And maybe any incremental DPPs that you have included in your initial guide? Because I know some states are working behind the scenes to get more programs approved. Thank you.\nMike Marks: Hi, Ann. Let me say this. It's a little early to give a lot of details around 2025. And as we finish our planning process in January call, we'll give you all of those details. I would say this, though. Largely, I think our cash net revenue per adjusted admission, we're planning on somewhere between 2% to 3% growth in 2025. And that's our early look at that metric. In terms of payer contracting, I don't know if this is exactly where you're going, but I'll go ahead and give you the update that we're now 80% complete in 2025, 54% complete for 2026, and just short of 20% complete for 2027. And we're still tracking in that mid-single-digit update. So that's a quick update on the commercial side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nPito Chickering: So tagging on there, sort of two questions here on pricing next year. Do you assume any GDPs in that guidance range that you gave us for next year? And as you think about labor and OpEx, I guess, what do you guys assume for labor and OpEx within that guide for next year? Thanks so much.\nMike Marks: So, yes, I would repeat that really we'll be getting into the details of our margin profile assumptions for 2025 when we have our January call, still in the middle of our planning process, a little early to be getting into those details now for third quarter. And so let me just stay there related to that. I'm happy to give you a quick waiver update, though, for third quarter. And so I'll do that here. As we've noted before, Medicaid has historically been our most challenging payer, other than patients without insurance. The growth in the Medicaid supplemental payment programs across our states over the past several years have helped. But these programs are complex and variable from quarter-to-quarter, and when taken together with historical Medicare reimbursement, are still short of covering the cost to treat Medicaid patients. This quarter really illustrates the complexity and variability of these programs. As noted in my comments, Medicaid supplemental payment programs produced a modest benefit in the quarter versus prior year. This modest benefit was generally the net effect of a reduction from the Florida program, given our change to accruing, as offset by receiving the North Carolina benefit in third quarter of '24 versus fourth quarter of last year, and then the new Nevada program that kicked in this year. We still project that we will have $100 million to $200 million tailwind from Medicaid supplemental payment programs in 2024 to prior year but would now lean to the higher end of that range.\nSam Hazen: Mike, let me just add something, Pito. I think, as I mentioned in my comments, that we anticipate a stable operating environment for 2025. That suggests demand sort of in the zone, as we talked about, which is better than our long-term assumptions around demand. Mike just spoke to our pricing and reimbursement environment being generally consistent and sort of programmed for 2025. And then with respect to our costs, we do think inflationary trends are generally consistent with what we've seen on the labor side for 2024, and we have reasonable assumptions around the rest of our costs to be somewhat stable and in line with sort of 2024. Now, we're putting a finer point on that as we finish the year and land on a few things. So, that's how we're characterizing a stable operating environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Mock from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Mok: Looks like there was a deceleration in inpatient revenue per admission from 6.5% in the first half of the year, which was very strong, to about half of that in the third quarter. I just want to understand the underlying drivers there between acuity, mix, and rate. Thanks.\nMike Marks: So, when I think about the NRA growth rate in third quarter versus kind of year-to-date or the first half of the year, as you know, really all of the decline in the growth rate is driven by state supplemental programs. We had growth in Medicaid supplemental program revenues in third quarter of 2024 to prior year, but well below the growth rate in the first half of 2024 to prior year. Consistent with the first two quarters of 2024, we had good growth in acuity and strong payer mix in the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joanna Gajuk from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoanna Gajuk: So, maybe I guess on the payer mix a little bit additional question here in terms of the exchange volumes and the Medicaid volumes in the quarter. I guess you gave us Medicare, so also commercial volume growth in the quarter. So, maybe I can kind of give us additional, I guess, data points on the payer mix and the volume growth in the quarter by payer. Thank you.\nMike Marks: Sure. Good morning. So, I'm going to use equivalent admission growth in third quarter of 24 to prior year, same facility. And so, let's run down. Medicare up 5% on equivalent admissions. Medicaid down 8.5% on equivalent admissions. Managed care volume excluding exchanges up just short of 4%. The exchange volume was at 43% growth, same facility to prior year. And then uninsured volumes were up 7.2%. So, that equates to that total of 4.5% growth in equivalent admissions in the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Gerlach from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Wow! That's a name from the past. It's Justin Lake from Wolfe. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the long-term debt and your leverage and how you're thinking about that going into next year. It looks like you're kind of ending the year around 3x. And then I apologize. I know I missed a little bit of the beginning of the fall, but I know you got asked about the hurricane impact in there. But anything that I might have missed in terms of how you're thinking about the hurricane and the potential it reoccurs next year within your guidance or the year 6%? How are you thinking about that $300 million? Thanks.\nMike Marks: Great, Justin. So, as it relates to cash flow, we had a really strong quarter in third quarter '24. We did end right at the lower end of the range on our leverage target. We've talked about this before, but every year at this time as part of our planning and budgeting process, we're working with our Finance Investment Committee and doing an evaluation of financial policies and we'll announce any changes to those if there are any on our first quarter call. So, we're still in the middle of that planning process related to those kinds of financial policies, but we are at the bottom of that leverage ratio. And what we articulated related to the 2025 in hurricanes is just that we generally believe that the ongoing effects of the hurricanes in 2025, which we think are going to be manageable, are primarily in our North Carolina market as our Tampa facility will be operational by the end of the year. We did take that into account, Justin, when we crafted our early look comments at being near or slightly above the upper end of long-term growth ranges. And as always, we'll give you a lot more details and context around our 2025 look when we do formal guidance update in January.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrian Tanquilut: Mike and Sam, as I think about the work that you're doing with the communities and disruption, how are you thinking about insurance claims or insurance reimbursement? And then maybe, Mike, just any color you can share on the change to the CapEx guidance.\nMike Marks: Sure. Let me write that down. So, on insurance, and we noted this in our release, the impacts that we've noted related to fourth quarter and third quarter did not include any estimate related to insurance recoveries at this point. It's still early. We're working through that now. We do anticipate having insured losses related to these hurricanes. It's a little early yet, and we're really not in a position to provide an estimate either to the timing of a potential recovery or the amount, but we do believe that there will be a claim for sure given the size of these storms. Related to the change in CapEx, it's really just the timing of capital projects. These are especially the bigger projects, as you know, take a long time, and the timing can flow a little bit up and down, but there's no implication there. We're still seeing a lot of really good opportunities to invest in our business, and so I would just articulate the slight decrease in what we think we're going to spend this year on CapEx being related more to timing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from SAP Securities (sic) [Leerink Partners]. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: Sam, you've had a big focus on the AI and technology investment. Just wondering if there's any new learnings, any efficiencies that you guys are seeing from those investments, maybe around labor management or other areas that you can share that you find encouraging that would be helpful. Thanks.\nSam Hazen: So, we yesterday actually presented our full plan on our digital agenda and how we are approaching advancing technology, and in particular AI, into the company's business over the next five to seven years, and we see many opportunities to improve our administrative functioning, our operational management of our business, and then ultimately the clinical outcomes for our patients, and so we're early. In that journey, we do have some areas where we're seeing promising results as it relates to using technology, and in particular artificial intelligence, more effectively. Some of that is in our scheduling capabilities where we've been able to improve the tools that our managers can use with more precise demand forecasting, better allocation of our workforce to meet the patient demands and such. So, that's encouraging and giving us a little bit of confidence. We have aspects of artificial intelligence embedded into our revenue cycle, as Mike mentioned, to manage the receivables performance and the revenue performance of the company more effectively and mitigate some of the denial pressures and so forth. So, those are early stage initiatives that are yielding positive results for us. They're not material yet, but we do see a growing set of initiatives. We're organizing around the agenda. We're going to be resourcing it even more as we push into the next few years, and we expect to get incremental improvements in '25 and '26 and on into the rest of this decade as we mature our efforts on this particular front. I mean, it's our view that we're at an inflection point. HEA Healthcare historically has performed at high levels across all elements of our business, I believe. Obviously, our growth has been good. Our margin performance has been good. Our clinical outcomes and quality performance to date is better than it was in 2019, so pre-pandemic to now we've improved our overall quality. And then with respect to our constituency engagements, employees, physicians, and even community, we've advanced that. So, we're at this incredible inflection point because of these tools, and in our business we see a lot of application, and so we're very excited about the potential that this particular agenda presents for our company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: I just wanted to ask about the volume growth assumption for next year. Is it 3% or 4%? If I was looking back at last quarter, I think you suggested the exchange is potentially worth as much as maybe 200 or 250 basis points of your growth this year. I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about some of these unusual coverage dynamics in the exchanges. And I guess for Medicaid, it's a headwind this year. Does it keep declining as you think about next year? Is that stabilized? Just trying to understand some of these more macro-driven dynamics inside your volume assumption. Thanks.\nMike Marks: Yeah, great question. Largely, I think exchange enrollment will moderate next year. Maybe in the 8% to 10% growth in enrollment is the best estimates we have versus in our states this year, enrollment growth was over 30%. So, that's one factor, certainly. I do think that Medicaid volumes will flatten out a bit in 2025 versus 2024 as we kind of sunset through the Medicaid redetermination process. So largely, I would say those are the two biggest dynamics. I think the net effect of that will be generally stable payer mix as we move from 2024 to 2025.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: I'm interested if you can update us on the contracting environment with Medicare Advantage plans, just separate from the two midnight rule dynamic and sort of how those trends have been playing out as some of the MA plans, or a lot of them, have been experiencing a lot of pressure on their rates and margins as well. And then just a quick follow-up, just around the '25 preliminary outlook, understanding it's only early, would there be any view on the impact on the cadence of EBITDA just around the impact from the hurricanes and the timing of recovering from that? Thanks.\nMike Marks: Let me cover the contracting piece, and then we'll jump to your second question. Generally speaking, we're largely contracted across the major Medicare Advantage payers. And as we've done our normal kind of set of renewals in 2024, we've been able to come to agreement with our payer partners in the Medicare Advantage space. That is our intention to continue to do that. We continue to work with our Medicare Advantage payer partners to work through the challenges that they have and that we have as a provider in their contracted network. But in terms of contracting, I would say that we are fairly consistent with where we've been in the past, which is largely contracted. And we've been able to secure renewals as we've gone through our 2024 renewal cycle. In terms of cadence of EBITDA, again, I think it's a little early to get into trying to think about earnings by quarter in 2025 at this point. So I'll push that answer to when we come together in January.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Langston. Please go ahead.\nRyan Langston: I mean, hurricanes are just kind of a fact of life in the southern states, typically not as severe, of course, as this year, but you did see some effects a couple years ago. I don't think you'd be overly reactive to this, but does this maybe cycle of hurricane activity do anything to affect sort of long-term strategy on capital allocation, M&A in terms of building, buying facilities, and maybe look outside of those geographies, even if only maybe somewhat incrementally? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. I think the short answer to that is no. We have seen our facilities, as I mentioned in my comments, recover. I'll just give you an example. Hurricane Ian, which affected our hospital in Port Charlotte, HCA Fawcett Hospital, a couple of years ago, that hospital was actually repaired, hardened, if you will, to hurricanes, and we're actually performing at a higher level than we were pre-Hurricane Ian. Hurricane Michael, which hit Panama City, Florida, also has been repaired significantly and hardened some as well. Obviously, a hurricane could hit it again and damage it, but that hospital is performing at a higher level than it was pre-storm. Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston a number of years ago and was a significant flood event, as a result, our Houston system has recovered and is also exceeding pre-Harvey performance as well. We still believe that the state of Florida, the Gulf Coast of Texas, and so forth, are very significant opportunities for our company. We believe wisely in those communities. We harden our facilities as much as we possibly can, but they are, in fact, a way of life. I will tell you, this year and I had personal experience with Katrina, it's very similar to the effects of Katrina. I mean, Hurricane Helene was a Category 4 storm, and if you would have asked me what two communities were most impacted, I would have never said, in 100 years, Augusta, Georgia, and Asheville, North Carolina. And so we dealt with an unprecedented storm, and again, HCA, we showed the power of the company, I think, but more importantly, the power of its people to respond to that, and I think we're going to be stronger as a result of it in those markets. We believe that our portfolio of communities that we serve are very well positioned for long-term growth, as we've indicated. We understand the risk associated with hurricanes and such. That's why we built the capabilities that we've got, and we think we're diversified enough across those communities to deal with that particular risk.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. Outpatient surgical trend remained negative despite a lower comp. In your 4Q and '25 guide, do you assume that stabilizes or turns positive? What's driving that pressure? And then just a quick clarification on the business interruption insurance comment that you made, what level of insurance do you carry? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: So, on outpatient surgery, as we indicated, nothing's changed from the trends we've seen this year. The declines have been focused almost entirely in Medicaid and uninsured. That's why our revenue per surgical case has been up 7%. We've seen acuity growth, and we've also seen a payer mix improvement in our outpatient surgery. The profitability of our outpatient surgery service is better as a result. So, on the headline, volume is down. On the bottom line, profits are up with respect to outpatient surgery. So, we're comfortable with that outcome. As it relates to next year, we don't anticipate any significant changes at this particular juncture. We believe our overall volume guidance includes the different categories that we've got. Our efforts on outpatient surgery continue to advance. We're advancing the number of surgery centers that we have in our company through greenfield development, as well as some targeted acquisitions. And we continue to improve the operations of our hospital-based outpatient surgery centers, providing better environments for our physicians and better care environments for our patients.\nMike Marks: And on your insurance question, we certainly have business interruption coverage as part of our property insurance program. But at this time, we're really not in position to provide estimates related to either the timing or the potential recovery under those insurance policies or the limits thereof. So, that's where we are now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom. Please go ahead.\nJohn Ransom: Just kind of backing up, I'm trying to think about things that we worried about five years ago that we don't talk about anymore. And one thing that comes to mind is value-based care and all that stuff. And I'm just curious, your commercial contracts in particular, I know they're fee-for-service, but what kind of kickers do you get in 2024 for things like hospital-acquired infections, readmissions, other quality metrics? What kind of kickers are you getting now versus then? Have they grown? And what are some examples of that? Thanks.\nSam Hazen: John, this is Sam. Those are very incremental inside of our overall revenue contracts with payers. And I won't say they're de minimis, but they're not material to the overall escalators that we have or the overall revenue equation inside of those contracts. We have some contracts that have modest provisions around those, but when you aggregate it for the company as a whole, it's a very small component of the escalators that we get. I mean, we are committed at our core to providing better care to our patients. And that's part and parcel to why our quality outcomes, as I mentioned, are better than they were in 2019. And we have a robust agenda across the organization to improve the outcomes for our patients, including some of the service metrics that you referenced there. So that's sort of core to how we approach it. And it's embedded, I think, in the offering of HCA facilities to payers and their members. And that's allowed us, we believe, to get to a point where we contract on a pretty consistent cycle. We've actually advanced the number of commercial contracts this year that we participate in with two major contract signings, Kaiser in Denver and then Blue Cross of Tennessee in Chattanooga. So we have very few commercial contracts across the country now where we don't participate. It's less than a handful. And we think that's a result of our access capabilities with our outpatient platform, as well as our quality and comprehensive service offerings that we provided back in our facilities.\nJohn Ransom: If I could just tag on, when you define quality, I know that's an amorphous concept to some people, but what's the data set that you use and how has that changed? Thanks. I'll ring off now. Thank you.\nSam Hazen: I mean, I don't know that we have enough time on this call, John, to talk about the data set that we have around quality. I mean, we have an increasing data set around quality. We have better insights into it as an organization. It includes everything from complications to mortality to hospital-acquired infections to length of stay to specific service line metrics for cardiovascular care, for bone marrow transplant, for ER processing, as I mentioned before. I mean, I can go on and on about it. We have a very integrated quality agenda with our leadership corporately and with our hospital teams. And all of that comes together in an advanced state for us as an organization. As we think about AI and the question that Whit asked earlier, we see that as the next frontier, allowing us to get even better at it, more efficient, and more transparent. So, it's really a fairly comprehensive program that we've continued to grow simply because our service offerings are more complex. Our ability to use our quality to attract physicians and patients and be more responsive to our communities is just sort of core to what we do day in and day out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Can you talk a little bit about some of the improvements you've been seeing in your wage and compensation expense ratio? In particular, what sort of wage inflation you're seeing currently in your contracting with nurses, et cetera? What your growth rates are looking like there? And then maybe just a quick cleanup, if you could just talk a little of the bad debt impacts you're seeing as a result of Medicaid redetermination, that'd be great too. Thanks.\nMike Marks: So, generally speaking, as we've come through this year, the wage rates that we're seeing across our markets are generally pretty stable. I think we've remarked before somewhere between the 2.5%, 3.5% range is about kind of what we're seeing. And if I think about for next year, as Sam mentioned, that we're anticipating and planning for a fairly stable operating environment, including wage inflation. So, that would be the wage part of that. On bad debt impacts, as we noted, I would use just the volume as an example. But if you think about the uninsured volume growth for equivalent admissions in the quarter at about 7%, we give you a sense of that. But in terms of bad debt or uninsured costs, it's pretty stable. And we don't anticipate significant changes to the stability as we go into next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCraig Hettenbach: Mike, can you touch on just the resiliency program of $600 million to $800 million savings? Just how are you thinking about that in 2025 and beyond from a timing perspective?\nMike Marks: Yes, good question. As I think about resiliency, we continue to see good output from the results of our work around our resiliency program. A few points of that would be, one, the length of stay agenda or case management agenda, where this year we've seen about a 1.5% reduction in our length of stay this year, which has been very helpful as we've managed both our labor and our capacity as we've gone through this year and accommodated additional volume growth. Labor management, which we've just talked about as we've gone here through the third quarter, our resiliency actions have allowed us to show margin improvement in labor and really contributes to, as we think about 2025 and beyond, using this resiliency program to help fund and support the investments that we're making in our tech and innovation programs and still allow us to produce good returns to our global set of stakeholders. So generally speaking, I'd say we're on track. And as we noted in Investor Day, the next two or three years here are going to be largely using our resiliency program to pay for tech and innovation investments. And then as we kind of move deeper into the decade to support our margins and deal with the challenges that may come. But I'm pleased with the current status and the trajectory of our overall resiliency program, and that would be a status update that I would give for now.\nCraig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just a quick follow up on professional fees leveling off on a sequential basis. Do you expect that to be stable in 2025 as well?\nMike Marks: Well, it's again a little early to be given that level of detail for '25. Clearly, we are pleased and encouraged with the work that our operating and our physician services teams have been doing to deal with the pressures and really specifically in the hospital based physician world. As you kind of walk through the quarters this year, our first quarter grew 20% to prior year. Our second quarter grew 13% to prior year. And now in third quarter, we're down to 10%. And we were able to keep that growth fairly sequential from second to third quarter. I do think given what we're seeing and the results of our work that that's part of Sam's comment for next year of a stable operating environment. And so I think that I would for now until we get to January, I would largely articulate the [indiscernible] environment in that same concept.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJamie Perse: I was just looking for a Valesco update. What's the status of losses in the third quarter? Where are you in turning around that enterprise and getting improved pricing there? And just what are your latest thoughts on timing of when you can get that to break even or potentially profitable? Thank you.\nSam Hazen: This is Sam. On Valesco, we're pleased with the integration that's happened this year. We were able to assimilate, as we've mentioned before, 5,500 physicians from that particular group into HCA management systems and so forth. Our objectives with Valesco are to get it to an appropriate level of financial performance. This year we are, in fact, on our plan, maybe slightly ahead of it, but it's not material to the company as a whole. Our long-term objectives with Valesco are to create an internal capability with this particular physician group that basically turns this into a strategic asset. And by that, I mean we have the ability to improve our clinical outcomes and quality results for our patients because we have a physician group that is fully integrated as an employed base inside of HCA. We can build more rigor, more routines, more standards in how we do clinical processing. The second thing we think we can accomplish in our journey to make it a strategic asset is to improve efficiency, embed these physicians more into how we manage our emergency rooms, how we execute on our case management agenda, and so forth. And then, thirdly, we think we can leverage this group to help us with our tech agenda, to help us with our growth agenda by building relationships with referring physicians and help us with outreach. So, those aspects of value creation that we see with Valesco far exceed sort of the financial performance inside the group. We continue to improve our reimbursement with the payers as it relates to hospital-based physicians, but these other elements provide more value, we think, globally to the organization and will be part and parcel to our core initiatives.\nFrank Morgan: Okay, Jeremy, we'll take one more question.\nOperator: All right, perfect. Our last question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Raskin: So, I heard Medicaid adjusted admissions were down 8.5% in the quarter. It's actually not as big as the decline in total Medicaid lives in the market. So, I'm curious if these additional state sub-payments and sort of broad increases to Medicaid funding has impacted strategy around serving Medicaid patients. Are you thinking differently about capacity or service lines to Medicaid specifically?\nSam Hazen: Josh, this is Sam. Actually, no, the contrary. We are finding opportunities to improve offerings for Medicaid beneficiaries through some of our outpatient development in certain markets. The supplemental payment programs that Mike has alluded to over the past have created reimbursement in some situations where it makes it easier for us to invest in services and capabilities that help the Medicaid beneficiaries and produce better environments for them to get care. So, I don't see that anything has changed our core thinking around how we provide available services to that particular beneficiary, and we'll continue to evaluate that. I think for HCA as a whole, 17%, 18% of our adjusted admissions are Medicaid. So, it's a large piece of our organization. The decline this year is really centered around redetermination mostly, not funding from one state to the other. It was through that process of redetermination that some of the business moved amongst the payer classes as we've indicated over the year. That will slow down because we don't have a redetermination process next year, and we will continue to evaluate how to use our investments to properly allocate to meet the needs of our communities broadly and in some cases specifically for Medicaid.\nOperator: All right. That is all the questions in the queue, so I'll turn it back over to Mr. Frank Morgan for closing remarks.\nFrank Morgan: Jeremy, thank you for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. I hope you have a great weekend. I'm around this afternoon if I can answer additional questions you might have. Good day.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Have a pleasant day, everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "Hi, good morning to everybody. Before we get to the financial results for the quarter, I want to share the heroic efforts of our people as they recently responded to, in less than two weeks, two major hurricanes that impacted some of our communities and facilities. Over the years, HCA Healthcare has developed industry-leading enterprise capabilities to support our hospitals during disasters. We have used learnings from past experiences, conducted extensive training, and built strong partnerships with key vendors to create a systematic approach to preparing for and responding to major events like hurricanes. These resources were put to use by our teams with outstanding results over these past few weeks as enough hospitals were in the path of these storms. But what's even more impressive is the unwavering dedication, remarkable bravery, and outstanding leadership demonstrated by the people in our company who worked throughout these storms and, in many instances, multiple days without rest to ensure our patients and colleagues were safe. Leveraging corporate capabilities effectively to support committed people in our facilities is fundamentally our formula for success. We call it the HCA way. It works well in normal times, it worked well in the pandemic, and now it has proven itself again in these hurricanes. A few of our communities were significantly impacted by these storms. This is especially evident in the Asheville area and parts of Tampa-St. Pete. Given the basic infrastructure role we play in our communities and the duty we have to be there for them in each situations, we have not veered from doing the right thing. I'm humbled by the determination and teamwork of HCA people. I'm honored to be associated with them and I'm proud of how they continually show up in difficult circumstances and deliver tremendously positive outcomes for our patients, each other, and their communities. They truly demonstrate that they are, above all else, committed to the care and improvement of human life, and I want to thank them for what they do to make this company great. Now to the quarter's results. Like the first half of the year, the results for the third quarter were strong and reflected solid revenue growth and margin improvement. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, increased 25% to $4.90. These results include an estimated impact of $0.15 per share from lost revenue and additional expenses caused by Hurricane Helene. While the rest of our hospitals and outpatient facilities in the path of the storms are fully operational, we have two hospitals that continue to deal with the aftereffects of the storms. First, HCA Mission Hospital, which is the only hospital in the Asheville area, was affected by Hurricane Helene and it has continued to operate and provide high quality patient care, even with significant city infrastructure in disrepair, and that's primarily water. As a consequence of this storm, we anticipate incurring significant expenses and lost revenue related to these issues throughout the remainder of the year. We also expect some continued, but we think manageable, impact into 2025. As it pertains to Hurricane Milton, which hit Florida in October, our HCA Florida Largo Hospital was flooded. It is currently closed because of damage to the building's infrastructure. We anticipate significant repair expenses will be incurred at this hospital during the fourth quarter, in addition to losing revenue. Our teams, however, are working around the clock to reopen it in late December. HCA Healthcare has numerous examples from past hurricanes where our hospitals have recovered from major storms and become more productive than pre-storm performance. I believe we can produce similar results with these two hospitals in time as we move beyond the aftereffects of these most recent storms. During the quarter, volume growth across our markets and service lines, while modestly affected by Hurricane Helene, was strong and broad based. On a same facilities basis, inpatient admissions grew 4.5% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted admissions also grew 4.5%. Emergency room visits increased 4.6%. Inpatient surgeries were up 1.6%. Other volume categories, including cardiac procedures, inpatient rehab admissions, and obstetric volumes had solid growth. Outpatient surgery was the only major service category that declined. It was down 2%. However, the revenue in this service line increased 5% because of acuity and payer mix. Payer mix across other service lines and acuity within inpatient services improved in the quarter. These factors helped generate same facilities revenue growth of 7.1%. We continue to believe the investments we are making in our network development agenda drive value for our patients and the organization. By the end of this year, we expect to have added approximately 600 inpatient beds and 100 new outpatient facilities, bringing our total sites of care to over 2,600. Currently, the company has around $6 billion of projects under development. These investments, which should come online over the next few years will add more capacity and create greater access across our networks, allowing us to meet the growing demand for healthcare services we anticipate in our markets. Before I turn the call to Mike, I want to close with a few early thoughts on 2025. Our planning process, which includes continuing assessments of the hurricane-related impact, has not been completed. So I will caveat my comments with the fact that it is always difficult to predict with certainty the various components of our business, and these preliminary views may change. With respect to volume, we went into this year believing that growth would exceed our long-term demand assumptions of 2% to 3%, and throughout the year it has. As we look to 2025, we assume volume growth will continue at elevated levels in the range of 3% to 4% for the year. With respect to our earnings outlook for next year, we believe that the strong volume growth assumption, coupled with an anticipated mostly stable operating environment, should generate earnings growth near or slightly above the upper end of our long-term target ranges for both diluted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA. As usual, in January, we will provide you with our guidance for 2025. And with that, I'll turn the call to Mike. Yes, and let me add to that, AJ. I think, broadly, most of our service categories are growing really well. And we think the emergency room continues to be a very important solution for people in our communities. And it continues to grow and we continue to invest in it. And we continue to improve our patient outcomes with our ER optimization agenda. We continue to see good strength in our cardiac business broadly across the organization. And as I said, in terms of the geography of the company, we've had broad-based growth as well with very few challenges, if you will across the important markets of our company. Mike, let me just add something, Pito. I think, as I mentioned in my comments, that we anticipate a stable operating environment for 2025. That suggests demand sort of in the zone, as we talked about, which is better than our long-term assumptions around demand. Mike just spoke to our pricing and reimbursement environment being generally consistent and sort of programmed for 2025. And then with respect to our costs, we do think inflationary trends are generally consistent with what we've seen on the labor side for 2024, and we have reasonable assumptions around the rest of our costs to be somewhat stable and in line with sort of 2024. Now, we're putting a finer point on that as we finish the year and land on a few things. So, that's how we're characterizing a stable operating environment. So, we yesterday actually presented our full plan on our digital agenda and how we are approaching advancing technology, and in particular AI, into the company's business over the next five to seven years, and we see many opportunities to improve our administrative functioning, our operational management of our business, and then ultimately the clinical outcomes for our patients, and so we're early. In that journey, we do have some areas where we're seeing promising results as it relates to using technology, and in particular artificial intelligence, more effectively. Some of that is in our scheduling capabilities where we've been able to improve the tools that our managers can use with more precise demand forecasting, better allocation of our workforce to meet the patient demands and such. So, that's encouraging and giving us a little bit of confidence. We have aspects of artificial intelligence embedded into our revenue cycle, as Mike mentioned, to manage the receivables performance and the revenue performance of the company more effectively and mitigate some of the denial pressures and so forth. So, those are early stage initiatives that are yielding positive results for us. They're not material yet, but we do see a growing set of initiatives. We're organizing around the agenda. We're going to be resourcing it even more as we push into the next few years, and we expect to get incremental improvements in '25 and '26 and on into the rest of this decade as we mature our efforts on this particular front. I mean, it's our view that we're at an inflection point. HEA Healthcare historically has performed at high levels across all elements of our business, I believe. Obviously, our growth has been good. Our margin performance has been good. Our clinical outcomes and quality performance to date is better than it was in 2019, so pre-pandemic to now we've improved our overall quality. And then with respect to our constituency engagements, employees, physicians, and even community, we've advanced that. So, we're at this incredible inflection point because of these tools, and in our business we see a lot of application, and so we're very excited about the potential that this particular agenda presents for our company. This is Sam. I think the short answer to that is no. We have seen our facilities, as I mentioned in my comments, recover. I'll just give you an example. Hurricane Ian, which affected our hospital in Port Charlotte, HCA Fawcett Hospital, a couple of years ago, that hospital was actually repaired, hardened, if you will, to hurricanes, and we're actually performing at a higher level than we were pre-Hurricane Ian. Hurricane Michael, which hit Panama City, Florida, also has been repaired significantly and hardened some as well. Obviously, a hurricane could hit it again and damage it, but that hospital is performing at a higher level than it was pre-storm. Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston a number of years ago and was a significant flood event, as a result, our Houston system has recovered and is also exceeding pre-Harvey performance as well. We still believe that the state of Florida, the Gulf Coast of Texas, and so forth, are very significant opportunities for our company. We believe wisely in those communities. We harden our facilities as much as we possibly can, but they are, in fact, a way of life. I will tell you, this year and I had personal experience with Katrina, it's very similar to the effects of Katrina. I mean, Hurricane Helene was a Category 4 storm, and if you would have asked me what two communities were most impacted, I would have never said, in 100 years, Augusta, Georgia, and Asheville, North Carolina. And so we dealt with an unprecedented storm, and again, HCA, we showed the power of the company, I think, but more importantly, the power of its people to respond to that, and I think we're going to be stronger as a result of it in those markets. We believe that our portfolio of communities that we serve are very well positioned for long-term growth, as we've indicated. We understand the risk associated with hurricanes and such. That's why we built the capabilities that we've got, and we think we're diversified enough across those communities to deal with that particular risk. So, on outpatient surgery, as we indicated, nothing's changed from the trends we've seen this year. The declines have been focused almost entirely in Medicaid and uninsured. That's why our revenue per surgical case has been up 7%. We've seen acuity growth, and we've also seen a payer mix improvement in our outpatient surgery. The profitability of our outpatient surgery service is better as a result. So, on the headline, volume is down. On the bottom line, profits are up with respect to outpatient surgery. So, we're comfortable with that outcome. As it relates to next year, we don't anticipate any significant changes at this particular juncture. We believe our overall volume guidance includes the different categories that we've got. Our efforts on outpatient surgery continue to advance. We're advancing the number of surgery centers that we have in our company through greenfield development, as well as some targeted acquisitions. And we continue to improve the operations of our hospital-based outpatient surgery centers, providing better environments for our physicians and better care environments for our patients. John, this is Sam. Those are very incremental inside of our overall revenue contracts with payers. And I won't say they're de minimis, but they're not material to the overall escalators that we have or the overall revenue equation inside of those contracts. We have some contracts that have modest provisions around those, but when you aggregate it for the company as a whole, it's a very small component of the escalators that we get. I mean, we are committed at our core to providing better care to our patients. And that's part and parcel to why our quality outcomes, as I mentioned, are better than they were in 2019. And we have a robust agenda across the organization to improve the outcomes for our patients, including some of the service metrics that you referenced there. So that's sort of core to how we approach it. And it's embedded, I think, in the offering of HCA facilities to payers and their members. And that's allowed us, we believe, to get to a point where we contract on a pretty consistent cycle. We've actually advanced the number of commercial contracts this year that we participate in with two major contract signings, Kaiser in Denver and then Blue Cross of Tennessee in Chattanooga. So we have very few commercial contracts across the country now where we don't participate. It's less than a handful. And we think that's a result of our access capabilities with our outpatient platform, as well as our quality and comprehensive service offerings that we provided back in our facilities. I mean, I don't know that we have enough time on this call, John, to talk about the data set that we have around quality. I mean, we have an increasing data set around quality. We have better insights into it as an organization. It includes everything from complications to mortality to hospital-acquired infections to length of stay to specific service line metrics for cardiovascular care, for bone marrow transplant, for ER processing, as I mentioned before. I mean, I can go on and on about it. We have a very integrated quality agenda with our leadership corporately and with our hospital teams. And all of that comes together in an advanced state for us as an organization. As we think about AI and the question that Whit asked earlier, we see that as the next frontier, allowing us to get even better at it, more efficient, and more transparent. So, it's really a fairly comprehensive program that we've continued to grow simply because our service offerings are more complex. Our ability to use our quality to attract physicians and patients and be more responsive to our communities is just sort of core to what we do day in and day out. This is Sam. On Valesco, we're pleased with the integration that's happened this year. We were able to assimilate, as we've mentioned before, 5,500 physicians from that particular group into HCA management systems and so forth. Our objectives with Valesco are to get it to an appropriate level of financial performance. This year we are, in fact, on our plan, maybe slightly ahead of it, but it's not material to the company as a whole. Our long-term objectives with Valesco are to create an internal capability with this particular physician group that basically turns this into a strategic asset. And by that, I mean we have the ability to improve our clinical outcomes and quality results for our patients because we have a physician group that is fully integrated as an employed base inside of HCA. We can build more rigor, more routines, more standards in how we do clinical processing. The second thing we think we can accomplish in our journey to make it a strategic asset is to improve efficiency, embed these physicians more into how we manage our emergency rooms, how we execute on our case management agenda, and so forth. And then, thirdly, we think we can leverage this group to help us with our tech agenda, to help us with our growth agenda by building relationships with referring physicians and help us with outreach. So, those aspects of value creation that we see with Valesco far exceed sort of the financial performance inside the group. We continue to improve our reimbursement with the payers as it relates to hospital-based physicians, but these other elements provide more value, we think, globally to the organization and will be part and parcel to our core initiatives. Josh, this is Sam. Actually, no, the contrary. We are finding opportunities to improve offerings for Medicaid beneficiaries through some of our outpatient development in certain markets. The supplemental payment programs that Mike has alluded to over the past have created reimbursement in some situations where it makes it easier for us to invest in services and capabilities that help the Medicaid beneficiaries and produce better environments for them to get care. So, I don't see that anything has changed our core thinking around how we provide available services to that particular beneficiary, and we'll continue to evaluate that. I think for HCA as a whole, 17%, 18% of our adjusted admissions are Medicaid. So, it's a large piece of our organization. The decline this year is really centered around redetermination mostly, not funding from one state to the other. It was through that process of redetermination that some of the business moved amongst the payer classes as we've indicated over the year. That will slow down because we don't have a redetermination process next year, and we will continue to evaluate how to use our investments to properly allocate to meet the needs of our communities broadly and in some cases specifically for Medicaid."

            "content": "Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with the third quarter. We produced good volume growth and margins, especially when considering the impact of the hurricanes. I'll start with a few details of the two storms that impacted us recently. Hurricane Helene made landfall in the Big Bend area of Florida on September 26th and impacted our communities and operations in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. We had 29 hospitals in the path of the storm which had to prepare and respond. And financially, we have seen a loss of revenue and incurred additional expenses during the preparation, during storm, and the response phases. As an example, we are expecting to spend at least $13 million on water supply to Mission Hospital and our other health care facilities related to Hurricane Helene through the month of October. And city potable water supply is not projected to be re-established at Mission Hospital for several more weeks. As Sam noted, we estimate that Hurricane Helene impacted the third quarter by $50 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Hurricane Milton hit the west coast of Florida just south of Sarasota on October 9 and impacted a large portion of the Florida peninsula. We had over 34 hospitals in the path of this storm that had to prepare and respond, including HCA Florida Largo Hospital, which is still under repair. As we think about the ongoing impacts of both major hurricanes, we anticipate additional expenses and loss of revenue will be approximately $200 million to $300 million or $0.60 to $0.90 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2024. This impact relates primarily to our hospitals in North Carolina and our Largo Hospital in Florida. These estimates do not include any insurance recoveries the company may receive in the future. I would like to add my appreciation to our care teams and all the HCA colleagues who provided support during these storms and my concern and prayers for the communities and the people impacted as we collectively recover and respond. It is a true honor to work with our colleagues and our physicians and to serve these communities. Now let me transition to our 2024 guidance. As noted in our release, we reaffirmed our 2024 estimated guidance ranges. Given the ongoing impact of the two major hurricanes on the remainder of the year, we estimate that the results are likely to be in the lower half of the ranges provided. Now to the results for the quarter. Sam reviewed our strong volumes, which resulted in revenue growth of 7.9% in the quarter over prior year. So I will focus on operating costs in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter improved 90 basis points over prior year. Labor cost as a percent of revenue improved 160 basis points from the prior year. We continued to see good results on contract labor, which improved 18% from the prior year and represented 4.6% of total labor cost. Supply cost as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points over the prior year but were relatively consistent sequentially. Other operating cost as a percent of revenue increased 40 basis points over the prior year. Professional fee cost growth over prior year moderated to 10% and was flat sequentially to the second quarter. We had expense growth associated with Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs and we had increased repair maintenance costs related to Hurricane Helene. Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs provided a modest benefit to our third quarter '24 overall results. So a lot of movement parts in the quarter, but this was a solid quarter with over 13% growth in adjusted EBITDA driven by strong core operating performance across our portfolio of markets. Moving to capital allocation, we continued to deploy a balanced strategy of allocating capital for long-term value creation. Cash flow from operations was $3.5 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled 1.19 billion and we repurchased 1.79 billion of our outstanding shares during the quarter. We also paid 169 million in dividends. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage remains at the low end of our stated guidance range and we believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective. Finally, as noted in our release, we now estimate capital expenditures for 2024 to be approximately $5 billion. This lower estimate is due primarily to the timing of capital projects and we continue to see good opportunities for investing in our business. With that, Frank, I will turn over the call to you for questions. Thanks, AJ. This is Mike. As it relates to our 2025 commentary, let me say this. We generally believe that the ongoing effects of the hurricanes in 2025, which we, as Sam said, we think are manageable, will be primarily in North Carolina as we expect our Tampa facility to be operational by the end of 2024. And we took these storms and the potential lingering effects into 2025 into account when we set this being near or slightly above the upper end of our long-term growth range. As Sam noted as well, we will give much more context and details on our 2025 formal guidance in January. As it relates to volume, the only thing I might point in addition to the point that you made relative to, you know, strong volume pickups in the last part of last year, is that sequentially from Q2 to Q3 of 2024, we increased same facility admissions by 1.4%. And that sequential increase is in line with our past sequential trend. So, that's our sense of volume. Good morning, Ben. Thank you. Let me talk about denials generally first and then we'll pivot to midnight impact in the quarter. Ben, as we noted in our Investor Day, we have been working diligently on denial mitigation strategies through our integrated revenue cycle over the past several years. We certainly have seen payers ramp up the intensity level of their denial activities over the past several years. But given our focus and investment in these areas, we've been able to moderate the rate of growth in denial write-offs this year from prior year. So, denials were not a material impact to HCA in third quarter of 2024. A quick update on the Medicare to Medicare Advantage 2 midnight rule adoption. Our same facility total Medicare admissions increased 5.3% in the quarter. Traditional Medicare admits were basically flat. Medicare Advantage admissions were up 11% and we attribute approximately 2% of that 11% growth in Medicare Advantage admissions coming from the 2 midnight rule impact. This is equivalent to approximately 50 basis points of our overall admission growth and has remained consistent over the year. As we continue, as I think about the denial impact to your question on the 2 midnight rule, we do continue to see a modest reduction in the prior authorization denial trends for accounts with 2 midnights or greater compared to prior year so far in 2024. But we still have way too many denials. And we have a few large Medicare Advantage payers that are significant outliers driving these denials. For context, let me highlight a couple of comparisons of Medicare Advantage to traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage now represents 58% of total Medicare volume. The mix of observation to inpatients with Medicare Advantage is still significantly higher than traditional Medicare. Even now, nine months past the implementation of the 2 midnight rule. Lastly, the Medicare Advantage CMI adjusted length of stay ratio is approximately 10% higher than traditional Medicare, driven by payer-driven discharge delays. These drive cost burdens to providers. So as we're working with our Medicare Advantage payers, we're really trying to address two things. We're trying to address this denial burden and the cost burden. And so as you think about the adjudication process, we are starting to get, through the first quarters, denials all the way through the adjudication process. And now we are pursuing those through dispute resolution. As we've talked about before, dispute resolution can take a year to two years to fully complete. And so we are going to have to continue to pursue that strategy as we move forward. Hi, Ann. Let me say this. It's a little early to give a lot of details around 2025. And as we finish our planning process in January call, we'll give you all of those details. I would say this, though. Largely, I think our cash net revenue per adjusted admission, we're planning on somewhere between 2% to 3% growth in 2025. And that's our early look at that metric. In terms of payer contracting, I don't know if this is exactly where you're going, but I'll go ahead and give you the update that we're now 80% complete in 2025, 54% complete for 2026, and just short of 20% complete for 2027. And we're still tracking in that mid-single-digit update. So that's a quick update on the commercial side. So, yes, I would repeat that really we'll be getting into the details of our margin profile assumptions for 2025 when we have our January call, still in the middle of our planning process, a little early to be getting into those details now for third quarter. And so let me just stay there related to that. I'm happy to give you a quick waiver update, though, for third quarter. And so I'll do that here. As we've noted before, Medicaid has historically been our most challenging payer, other than patients without insurance. The growth in the Medicaid supplemental payment programs across our states over the past several years have helped. But these programs are complex and variable from quarter-to-quarter, and when taken together with historical Medicare reimbursement, are still short of covering the cost to treat Medicaid patients. This quarter really illustrates the complexity and variability of these programs. As noted in my comments, Medicaid supplemental payment programs produced a modest benefit in the quarter versus prior year. This modest benefit was generally the net effect of a reduction from the Florida program, given our change to accruing, as offset by receiving the North Carolina benefit in third quarter of '24 versus fourth quarter of last year, and then the new Nevada program that kicked in this year. We still project that we will have $100 million to $200 million tailwind from Medicaid supplemental payment programs in 2024 to prior year but would now lean to the higher end of that range. So, when I think about the NRA growth rate in third quarter versus kind of year-to-date or the first half of the year, as you know, really all of the decline in the growth rate is driven by state supplemental programs. We had growth in Medicaid supplemental program revenues in third quarter of 2024 to prior year, but well below the growth rate in the first half of 2024 to prior year. Consistent with the first two quarters of 2024, we had good growth in acuity and strong payer mix in the quarter. Sure. Good morning. So, I'm going to use equivalent admission growth in third quarter of 24 to prior year, same facility. And so, let's run down. Medicare up 5% on equivalent admissions. Medicaid down 8.5% on equivalent admissions. Managed care volume excluding exchanges up just short of 4%. The exchange volume was at 43% growth, same facility to prior year. And then uninsured volumes were up 7.2%. So, that equates to that total of 4.5% growth in equivalent admissions in the quarter. Great, Justin. So, as it relates to cash flow, we had a really strong quarter in third quarter '24. We did end right at the lower end of the range on our leverage target. We've talked about this before, but every year at this time as part of our planning and budgeting process, we're working with our Finance Investment Committee and doing an evaluation of financial policies and we'll announce any changes to those if there are any on our first quarter call. So, we're still in the middle of that planning process related to those kinds of financial policies, but we are at the bottom of that leverage ratio. And what we articulated related to the 2025 in hurricanes is just that we generally believe that the ongoing effects of the hurricanes in 2025, which we think are going to be manageable, are primarily in our North Carolina market as our Tampa facility will be operational by the end of the year. We did take that into account, Justin, when we crafted our early look comments at being near or slightly above the upper end of long-term growth ranges. And as always, we'll give you a lot more details and context around our 2025 look when we do formal guidance update in January. Sure. Let me write that down. So, on insurance, and we noted this in our release, the impacts that we've noted related to fourth quarter and third quarter did not include any estimate related to insurance recoveries at this point. It's still early. We're working through that now. We do anticipate having insured losses related to these hurricanes. It's a little early yet, and we're really not in a position to provide an estimate either to the timing of a potential recovery or the amount, but we do believe that there will be a claim for sure given the size of these storms. Related to the change in CapEx, it's really just the timing of capital projects. These are especially the bigger projects, as you know, take a long time, and the timing can flow a little bit up and down, but there's no implication there. We're still seeing a lot of really good opportunities to invest in our business, and so I would just articulate the slight decrease in what we think we're going to spend this year on CapEx being related more to timing. Yeah, great question. Largely, I think exchange enrollment will moderate next year. Maybe in the 8% to 10% growth in enrollment is the best estimates we have versus in our states this year, enrollment growth was over 30%. So, that's one factor, certainly. I do think that Medicaid volumes will flatten out a bit in 2025 versus 2024 as we kind of sunset through the Medicaid redetermination process. So largely, I would say those are the two biggest dynamics. I think the net effect of that will be generally stable payer mix as we move from 2024 to 2025. Let me cover the contracting piece, and then we'll jump to your second question. Generally speaking, we're largely contracted across the major Medicare Advantage payers. And as we've done our normal kind of set of renewals in 2024, we've been able to come to agreement with our payer partners in the Medicare Advantage space. That is our intention to continue to do that. We continue to work with our Medicare Advantage payer partners to work through the challenges that they have and that we have as a provider in their contracted network. But in terms of contracting, I would say that we are fairly consistent with where we've been in the past, which is largely contracted. And we've been able to secure renewals as we've gone through our 2024 renewal cycle. In terms of cadence of EBITDA, again, I think it's a little early to get into trying to think about earnings by quarter in 2025 at this point. So I'll push that answer to when we come together in January. And on your insurance question, we certainly have business interruption coverage as part of our property insurance program. But at this time, we're really not in position to provide estimates related to either the timing or the potential recovery under those insurance policies or the limits thereof. So, that's where we are now. So, generally speaking, as we've come through this year, the wage rates that we're seeing across our markets are generally pretty stable. I think we've remarked before somewhere between the 2.5%, 3.5% range is about kind of what we're seeing. And if I think about for next year, as Sam mentioned, that we're anticipating and planning for a fairly stable operating environment, including wage inflation. So, that would be the wage part of that. On bad debt impacts, as we noted, I would use just the volume as an example. But if you think about the uninsured volume growth for equivalent admissions in the quarter at about 7%, we give you a sense of that. But in terms of bad debt or uninsured costs, it's pretty stable. And we don't anticipate significant changes to the stability as we go into next year. Yes, good question. As I think about resiliency, we continue to see good output from the results of our work around our resiliency program. A few points of that would be, one, the length of stay agenda or case management agenda, where this year we've seen about a 1.5% reduction in our length of stay this year, which has been very helpful as we've managed both our labor and our capacity as we've gone through this year and accommodated additional volume growth. Labor management, which we've just talked about as we've gone here through the third quarter, our resiliency actions have allowed us to show margin improvement in labor and really contributes to, as we think about 2025 and beyond, using this resiliency program to help fund and support the investments that we're making in our tech and innovation programs and still allow us to produce good returns to our global set of stakeholders. So generally speaking, I'd say we're on track. And as we noted in Investor Day, the next two or three years here are going to be largely using our resiliency program to pay for tech and innovation investments. And then as we kind of move deeper into the decade to support our margins and deal with the challenges that may come. But I'm pleased with the current status and the trajectory of our overall resiliency program, and that would be a status update that I would give for now. Well, it's again a little early to be given that level of detail for '25. Clearly, we are pleased and encouraged with the work that our operating and our physician services teams have been doing to deal with the pressures and really specifically in the hospital based physician world. As you kind of walk through the quarters this year, our first quarter grew 20% to prior year. Our second quarter grew 13% to prior year. And now in third quarter, we're down to 10%. And we were able to keep that growth fairly sequential from second to third quarter. I do think given what we're seeing and the results of our work that that's part of Sam's comment for next year of a stable operating environment. And so I think that I would for now until we get to January, I would largely articulate the [indiscernible] environment in that same concept."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and our CFO, Mike Marks. Sam and Mike will provide some prepared remarks, and then we'll take some questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Hazen: All right. Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everyone. The Company's results for the second quarter were positive across the board and reflected strong demand for our services. In addition, our teams continue to execute our strategic plan effectively and produced positive outcomes for our patients, while also enhancing in our facilities, including better throughput and case management. I want to thank our HCA colleagues for their outstanding work and their continued pursuits to innovate and deliver on our mission. As compared to the prior year, diluted earnings per share as adjusted increased 28% to $5.50. Consistent with the first quarter, we saw broad-based volume growth across our markets and service lines. On a same facilities basis in the second quarter, inpatient admissions grew 5.8%, equivalent admissions grew 5.2%, emergency room visits increased 5.5%, inpatient surgeries were up 2.6%, outpatient surgery cases were down 2% and like the first quarter, the declines were mostly explained by lower volumes in Medicaid and self-pay categories. Similar to the past few quarters, other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and inpatient rehab services experienced strong growth. Payer mix improved year-over-year with commercial volumes representing 36.2% of equivalent admissions. And lastly, the acuity of our inpatient services as reflected in our case mix index increased slightly as compared to last year. These factors helped generate same-facility revenue growth of 10%. Also in the quarter, we progressed further on our cost agenda and produced solid operating margins. As we transition to the last half of 2024, we are encouraged by the Company's results. We believe the increased investments we are making in our people and facilities along with our disciplined approach to operations will continue to produce positive outcomes for our stakeholders. In closing, given our year-to-date performance and the backdrop of strong demand that we forecast for the remainder of the year, we have updated our guidance for the year, as indicated in our press release. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for more details.\nMike Marks: Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter showed continued solid performance with strong demand, improved margins and a balanced allocation of capital. Sam reviewed our top line results, so I will cover operating costs in the quarter. Operating costs were well managed, resulting in a margin improvement of 100 basis points to prior year and sequentially through the first quarter. Labor cost has improved 200 basis points from the prior year. And we continue to see good results in contract labor, which declined 25.7% from the prior year and represented 4.8% of total labor costs. Supply costs as a percent of revenues improved 50 basis points from the prior year. On other operating costs as a percent of revenue, they did grow compared to the prior year, but it remained relatively consistent for the past four quarters. We were encouraged that year-over-year same-facility professional fee costs growth moderated to approximately 13% in the second quarter, which compares favorably to the 20% increase we experienced in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.55 billion in the quarter, which represents a 16% increase over the prior year and included a modest benefit from Medicaid supplemental payments. As a management team, we are very pleased with the operational performance of the Company. Now moving to capital allocation. We continue to deploy a balanced strategy of allocating capital for long-term value creation. Cash flow from operations was just under $2 billion in the quarter, which is a decline of $500 million in the prior year, driven by income tax payments and timing of Medicaid supplemental program accruals and cash receipts. Capital expenditures totaled $1.28 billion, and we repurchased $1.37 billion of our outstanding share in the quarter. We also paid about $170 million in dividends. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range, and we believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective. Finally, in our release this morning, we are updating estimated guidance for 2024. For revenues, our new guidance range is $69.75 billion to $71.75 billion; net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, $5.675 billion to $5.975 billion; adjusted EBITDA, $13.75 billion to $14.25 billion; and diluted earnings per share, $21.60 to $22.80 per share. Based on the strength of our year-to-date results and our revised outlook, we estimate that share repurchases will be around $6 billion in 2024, subject to market conditions. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Frank, for questions and answers.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] Ellie, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is now open.\nA.J. Rice: Maybe just two areas that people are very focused on, supplemental payments. How is that running relative to your expectations? And in your back half comments, are you including anything for Tennessee? And then the other area being the public exchanges, what is the trend there year-to-year? And how much is growth in that helping for these strong results?\nMike Marks: Thank you, A.J., this is Mike. I'll take the supplemental question. I think as you're aware, Medicaid has historically been our most challenging payer, really other than patients without insurances, typically paying us significantly below the cost of carrying for Medicaid patients. Over the last several years, most states in which we operate have implemented or enhanced Medicaid reimbursement through supplemental payment programs. And while these supplemental programs are growing, it is important to put them in context. They can be complex, variable in their impact from quarter-to-quarter and when taken together with historical Medicaid reimbursement are still well short of covering the cost to treat Medicaid patients. We believe it is important to understand this backdrop when discussing these programs. But now to the quarter. In the second quarter, we recognized a year-over-year earnings increase of approximately $125 million related to our Medicaid supplemental payment programs driven primarily by the new program in Nevada and the accrual of the Florida program, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023. To your specific question about the new program in Tennessee, we -- that is with CMS for review, and we do not anticipate financial impact from that program in 2024. If you want to go to the public exchanges. For the quarter, and let me just kind of give commercial volumes in general first and then we'll kind of break out it. But our equivalent admissions for managed care, including our health care exchange volumes were up 12.5% in this quarter versus the prior year quarter. If you take our managed care volumes without health care exchanges, they were up just short of 5% on equivalent admissions. And for health care exchanges, we were up 46% over prior year for the quarter.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nSam Hazen: So, on the volume, I think as I mentioned and Mike alluded to there, I mean our Medicare volumes were up, I think by 6.5%. So, the volume was supported really across all payer categories. Clearly, the exchange and the enrollment over the last three years or so has become a bigger component of the business but still relatively small in comparison to the other payer classes. But nonetheless, we did see good volume across all payer classes with the Medicaid, I think being the only category that was down.\nMike Marks: And Medicaid were down 10% on equivalent admissions, mostly related to Medicaid redeterminations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.\nAnn Hynes: We talk about SWB, it was down quarter sequentially, and it's usually flat. Is that just driven by contract labor improvements? And if you can give us just any details on temporary labor percentage total contract labor, things like that, that would be great.\nMike Marks: Sure. Thanks, Ann. Contract labor was down 25.7% this quarter versus prior year quarter. As I noted in my opening comments, contract labor as a percentage of revenue -- I'm sorry, percentage of SWB was at 4.8% in the quarter. This compares to 6.8% in the second quarter of last year and almost 10% at the height of COVID in early 2022. So, we're continuing to see the improvements from all the work we're doing around recruiting and around retention, and that's paying the dividends in contract labor. If you think about kind of wage inflation, wage inflation was stable and kind of continues to run where we expected it to run. So also, we are pleased with our later results for the quarter.\nSam Hazen: And seasonally, we do tend to drop from the first quarter to the second quarter because some of the payroll taxes that we have to absorb in the first quarter are consumed by the end of the quarter or the early part of the second quarter, and that tends to improve a little bit of our metrics simply because of the timing of those tax payments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nPito Chickering: Can you bridge us to the back half EBITDA raise for this year? What percent of the upside you're changing is coming from better volumes? What percent is coming from changes to pricing mix or acuity? And then, how is just coming from just better margin improvement coming from labor? And then finally, are there any changes to supplemental assumptions for the back half of the year versus original guidance?\nMike Marks: So, we're obviously really pleased with our year-to-date due performance. It kind of sets our thinking about the back half of the year. On the top line, our volume and payer mix for the first six months of this year were better than our original expectations. Solid labor management, as we just talked about, including the contract labor declines also contributed to our thinking around the kind of our results. As we move into the back half of the year, we believe most of these trends should continue. We anticipate volume growth to be in the 4% to 6% range for the year. We expect salary wages and benefits supplies and other operating expenses as a percent of revenue to run mostly where we did June year-to-date. Contract labor as a percentage of salary wage and benefits is projected to be in roughly in the mid-4% range in the back half of 2024. And we do expect professional fee expense growth to the prior year to moderate a bit more in the back half of 2024 as well. Specifically, on Medicaid supplemental payments, as you recall in our original guidance, we anticipate a headwind of $100 million to $200 million from the Medicaid supplemental programs. As we've noted previously, these programs are complex and have a lot of variability quarter-to-quarter. But given that we are now deeper into 2024 and have better visibility into the programs across our states, we now anticipate an approximate $100 million to $200 million tailwind in 2024 from Medicaid supplemental payment programs, most of which occurred in the first half of 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Congrats on solid quarter. Maybe, Sam, just as we think about -- you called out Medicaid with the redetermination kind of dragging in volumes a little bit here. But still very, very good performance. So just curious where you stand now as you think about the sustainability of this elevated utilization trend.\nSam Hazen: Well, as Mike just mentioned, Brian, we do expect that these volume trends will continue throughout 2024. And we have had for -- including 2023, really solid volume growth. I think when we pull up and we look at volume for the Company and overall demand for our services, it starts with the markets that we serve. We are in markets, as we indicated at our Investor Day, that we think have solid characteristics that are going to support organic growth. That's the first thing. The second thing is the HCA network way. And that is how we build our network, how we execute inside of that. Our inpatient bed capacity is up 2% year-over-year. When you look at across all of our facilities, we've added a few hospitals in that as well, really small ones that are complementary. Our outpatient facilities overall are up 5%. So, our network development is a key part of our growth. And we think it's part and parcel to our ability to grow our market share, which we have grown, and we continue to see metrics that suggest our market share continues to be positive. The third thing for us is capital. We are investing heavily in who we are. We're investing in our network. We're investing in our people. We're investing in clinical technology for our physicians. And we're finding ways to use our capital to make our services better and produce better outcomes for our patients. So, this year, we'll invest somewhere around $5.2 billion, which is significantly up over the last couple of years, and we continue to see opportunities inside of our organization to invest capital. The next area, it's hard for us to know this, but we do believe that coverage -- when people are covered whether it's through the exchanges mostly, through their employers, through Medicare, they tend to purchase services. And so, coverage is up. So that helps elevate demand. And we are in really unchartered territories for growth in demand in a normal environment. And it's hard to know if there's a hangover from COVID, as we've mentioned in past calls and so forth, but we do believe the fundamental attributes of coverage help support demand growth. And then when you start looking across like we said earlier, the different payer classes, it's broad-based. It's broad-based across the different payers. It's broad-based across our services. I mean even obstetrics was up slightly in the quarter. So, we have seen just sort of a lift across all aspects of our business. And again, the diversification of HCA from market to market as well as the diversification from service allows us to participate in this demand growth, and we're pretty encouraged by what we see year-to-date and what we expect over the balance of this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBen Hendrix: I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more on the sources of acuity strength that you continue to see when parse that out between maybe the two midnight rule investments and higher acuity capabilities, or if there's like we heard some MCOs talk about higher acuity and continuing Medicaid book and then maybe even some pull-through -- pull-forward of acuity ahead of members being redetermined off. So, I just wanted to get any indication of kind of where you're seeing that acuity growth.\nSam Hazen: Well, this is Sam. Let me speak to our core strategy. And our core strategy is to create sort of a one stock capability within our systems. And by that, I mean, the ability to take care of a patient's need regardless of what their condition happens to be. So we, over time, have built complexity in the services that we've offered. So we've enhanced trauma programs. We've enhanced transplant programs. We've enhanced neonatal services. We've opened up our infrastructure with our transfer centers with helicopters, with ground transportation. We've interacted with the rural community in a way that support health care needs there, which typically tends to be more acute care service requirements than not. And so, all of that has been part and parcel toward our network strategy over the years. I will tell you, again, we had broad-based service growth in trauma in the number of ambulance deliveries that occurred at our hospitals, our cardiac care. Our cardiac surgery was up. So, we had -- neonatal admissions were up. All of these components that I mentioned that are essential to our network strategy saw growth. And so that has naturally lifted the case mix and the acuity of the patients that we serve. The two mid-night rule is actually dilutive when it comes to our case mix on the inpatient side. So, we jumped over the implications of the two midnight rules because those are lower acute patients deserve -- deserving to be in an inpatient status, but none the less than average equity by comparison. So, our quarter suggests that the acuity and the complexity of the services that we offer is even more than what it reports out simply because of the dilutive effect of the two mid-night rule.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nJustin Lake: Sam, wanted to get your view on one of the bigger questions we're all getting from investors heading into the election, which is the potential for exchange disruption should the enhanced subsidies be allowed to expire at the end of 2025. Has the Company run a scenario analysis of what happens to these volumes and hospital economics should those subsidies expire? And if not, maybe you could just share with us what you think happens to those patients in terms of coverage, who might drop from the exchanges? Do they become uninsured? Do you think they move to other payer types? And then if I could just squeeze in a numbers question. Can you tell us what same-store ASC revenue growth was in the quarter?\nSam Hazen: On the exchanges, Justin obviously, there's a lot to play out here politically between now and the end of the year. So, it's a little premature for us to forecast what's going to happen politically with respect to the exchanges. It's no secret that they are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. And many of the participants are in states that we serve, obviously, you've all seen that in the data that's available. We don't have a great line of sight on which participants in the exchange at what level of subsidies and how that will play out. It's really difficult for us to know precisely what that is. We are starting to try to study as much -- study. And we're hopeful that in 2025, we'll have some sense of the policies that might be put forth a better sense of the economics around the exposure if the subsidies go away. But at this point in time, it's way too early for us make any judgments on that. But we will be as transparent as we possibly can be with you all around it once we have information that we feel we can support and share appropriately.\nMike Marks: On same-store ASC revenue growth is about 8%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.\nWhit Mayo: Sam, you've talked a lot in recent quarters around the efficiencies and the throughput initiatives that you've had in the ER. Any numbers that you can share around any of those productivity gains that puts this in perspective, maybe we see it on the back end with length of stay? And just if you could comment on the commercial growth in the ER this quarter.\nSam Hazen: Okay. Let me start with the commercial ER growth. Our commercial volumes in the emergency grew almost 18%. So really strong growth in that category. Again, we are focused on throughput, patient satisfaction and high clinical performance with what we call our ER revitalization program. And our ER revitalization program has produced positive results for us. Our throughput, let's start with time to see a patient, is down two minutes. That didn't sound like that much. Well, we're moving from 11 to 9 minutes. That's the starting point. Our length of stay for patients who have been discharged is down, I think, about 15% to 20% to around 160 minutes or something in that zone. Again, throughput, getting the patient through the systems, communicating with them effectively and then getting them out when they're ready to be out. Then we have patients who are admitted. For those patients, we've also improved the hold time in the emergency room, so we can get them up to a floor and in a proper setting for care. And that also has improved markedly on a year-over-year basis. We have room to go. And we're continuing to invest in our leadership development. We're continuing to invest in technology. We put our care transformation and innovation team inside of our ER processes to help them think about different approaches. Our patient satisfaction has improved in our emergency room. And I want to say over 8 out of 10 patients would highly recommend or recommend an HCA emergency room. In addition to that, we're adding capacity. We've added capacity on our hospital campuses, but we've also added capacity off campus to really meet the needs of different communities and that's been part of our growth as well. We continue to invest in both aspects from a supply standpoint. And then we're investing heavily in our process standpoint to make sure that we're delivering the searches that our communities need and that our patients deserve. And I'm really proud of the effort that our teams have put forth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Mok from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Mok: One clarification and a question. First, can you just give us the exchange admissions as a percentage of total in the quarter? And then on the question, outpatient surgeries were down about 2%. Can you elaborate on some of the trends you're seeing there? Maybe break that out between hospital outpatient and ASC volumes?\nMike Marks: Yes. So, on the exchange volumes, they're just right at 7% of admissions and ER visits as well for exchange as a percent of total. What was the second question?\nSam Hazen: It was on outpatient surgery. Yes, I got it, right. So we were down in the quarter, 2% in the hospital on the same -- we back up, that's not same store here, sorry. Yes, we're a little over 2% on same stores and a little over 1% on ASCs. And that weighted out to about the 2% that we mentioned. Again, it's exclusively in Medicaid and uninsured. So, our overall revenue growth in our ASC and hospital outpatient surgery platform was up. Our profitability on that segment was up. And yes, we have a volume metric that's down, but the implications to our business really aren't there as a result of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nStephen Baxter: Just a couple more on the guidance. I was hoping to hear if you've updated your thinking on core wage inflation as part of this guidance revision. I'm wondering if that contributor potentially not due to the higher volumes you're staffing to. And then if there's any impact of M&A and the guidance [indiscernible] revenue and EBITDA that would be great to now too.\nMike Marks: If you look at wage inflation, as we kind of came in this year, we were thinking that 2.5% to 3% range, and that stays consistent as we think about where we are here and how we're going to kind of close to the back half of the year. So as -- thinking wage inflation will be fairly steady.\nSam Hazen: And then there's one on M&A.\nMike Marks: So, there were some questions on M&A. Let me just kind of run through that. So, you have $400 million of revenue in new stores. About $250 million of that is from Valesco. The rest are from the acquisitions in Texas, you heard us talk about the Wise Healthcare System acquisition couple of others. And that's the revenue side of that. It was dilutive to earnings, though and about 1% negative impact to EBITDA for the quarter. So, the M&A trends don't really impact or did not really impact our year-over-year EBITDA growth in any material way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Your line is now open.\nScott Fidel: I was hoping to just circle back on the Medicaid supplemental payments. And maybe if you can just sort of talk about how your Medicaid margins have evolved from maybe where they were a couple of years ago to where they are currently inclusive of the Medicaid supplemental payments. I know that you had mentioned how this is really just trying to get the business still on Medicaid back closer to breakeven or maybe not even there yet. So helpful if you could sort of walk us through that? And then just looking out to the elections, there is a level of investor uncertainty around the sustainability of Medicaid supplemental payments, if there was a switch in the White House, although I do think it's notable that we do see many of the states that are sponsoring these payments are from red states. So, it feels like these payments slightly would be quite sustainable. But there is a lot of investor uncertainty around this topic. So, we certainly appreciate your thinking on that.\nMike Marks: Yes, thank you. I'll take the second one first. We do see good sustainability around the Medicaid supplemental payment programs. As you noted, they're well supported historically, both in red states and blue states. And frankly, two of our biggest programs are in Texas, Florida. So that will give you a sense of those things. The new rule that came out earlier this year on sustainable programs, Medicaid supplemental programs, we found to be positive and supportive and actually good for the provider industry. If you think about kind of margins over time, if you go historically back in time, the Medicaid margins -- and you're right, I mean, supplemental payments are really just core to Medicaid, they were pretty significantly below the cost of caring for Medicaid patients in the past. Over the last several years, they have grown some and more states have added programs or enhanced programs. But even now, if you look at where we are in 2024, and you think about the historical base Medicaid reimbursement plus the supplemental payment reimbursement, it's still pretty well short of the cost of caring for those patients. So that's the context that we would provide on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Cassorla from Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nJason Cassorla: Just wanted to ask on CapEx. It sounds like you're maintaining your outlook there, but just in context of the higher 2024 revenue and EBITDA outlook. I just I guess curious if there's anything to call out on the CapEx side. And apologies if I missed this, but it sounds like maybe perhaps you're expecting to use the excess free cash flow from the guide raise just for share repurchase, or how should we think about that?\nMike Marks: We are not really revising our CapEx. As we started the year, we talked about $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. We think it's still going to generally be in that same range. As noted in our comments, we do expect based on the improved outlook and the updated guidance that we're going to spend about $6 billion in 2024 on share repurchase. So, the bulk of the increase from the improved results would be going towards share repurchase.\nSam Hazen: Let me add, Mike, if I may, it's Sam, to the capital. I think it's important to understand that we operate on an inpatient occupancy level in the mid -- low to mid-70s even in the second quarter, which is in addition to the fact that we added 2% inpatient bed as I mentioned. So our inpatient occupancy continues to grow, reflecting the acuity of our patients, reflecting the overall demand and reflecting the market share gains that we believe we're experiencing. The second piece is our ambulatory network development. Again, we have about 2,600 outpatient facilities and clinics across the Company, up 5% from where it was last year. Those are a component of our capital spending as well. And we will continue to look for opportunities from one market to the other to build out a network that serves our patients as we need to serve them. And the third piece is infrastructure. I mean we are in an infrastructure business. It requires us to have facilities that have the appropriate environment for our patients. We have to upgrade basic elements of those facilities and so forth. And so, a lot of that is maintenance. So, half of our capital goes towards maintenance to keep our facilities where they need to be. And then the last thing for us is technology. We are investing more in our technology agenda because we see opportunities for it to support the Company's next-generation growth and allow us to serve our patients even better. So, our technology component of our CapEx continues to grow. All of this is in the backdrop of our long-term view on demand. As we indicated in November at our Investor Day, we expect long-term demand to be in that 2% to 3% zone as well. And so, we have to build the necessary capabilities in our networks in our facilities to be able to serve that demand, and that's where our capital expenditure plan is intended to accomplish.\nMike Marks: Sam, let me clarify real quick. I said $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. It's actually $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion in capital spending for 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKevin Fischbeck: It sounds like you believe that the volume and the demand support this volume as a kind of a base for the future. I wanted to see if you could give a little color on the margin side of things. Is this the right way to be thinking about the base when we think about ex year? Is there anything puts or takes that you would point to? I know sometimes when volume comes in stronger than you plan for, maybe there's a little bit more margin leverage than you would expect, and maybe that might moderate or whether you mentioned the timing in the past about some of -- payments. Is there any obvious headwind from timing from this year into next year we should be thinking about as we think about margins and EBITDA sustainability? Is this a good base for thinking about next year's growth?\nSam Hazen: We aren't going, Kevin, this is Sam, speak to 2025. I will tell you that we do not have any unusual event thus far through the first six months this year. This is core operations. And as Mike said, slightly by the Medicaid supplemental programs. So as sort of a core operational level of performance, it's really quite plain by comparison to some of the choppiness that naturally occurs with COVID, with the supplemental payment timings and so forth, with some of the challenges we experienced last year with just the inheritance of Valesco and so forth. But when we look at the first six months, and we think about the balance of the year, this is really a solid operational performance, supported by strong volume and not really unusual items benefiting or dragging the business in any material right. That's how I'd answer that question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Langston from TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nRyan Langston: Just want to go back to labor for a second. Obviously, impressive results. Is there anything particular in recent achievements driving these results, maybe pass throughput and length of stay reduction and maybe how to think about that carrying forward over the next few quarters? And then just there is some potential M&A larger deals in the market, both on the hospital and the ambulatory side. Understand end market tends to be where you focus. But can you maybe just remind us of the parameters that you would need to entertain maybe a more larger market or national expansion?\nMike Marks: Yes. So labor, as we've already said, the biggest driver, if you think about our performance in the first half of the year compared to prior year was this reduction in contract labor. And that kind of comes through all the work we've been doing over the last several years, improving our recruitment activities and really working on retention. On the recruitment side, you've heard us talk about our academic affiliation work, our work around the Galen School of Nursing. And all of that has kind of produced improved supply of nursing into our markets, which has been super beneficial. I do think from a contract labor perspective, we're -- as I noted in my comments, we're down to 4.8% of contract labor as a percentage of salary wages and benefits. And I do think that the go-forward improvement, we'll still have some. We've guided, as you've noted from my comment on guidance that we think we'll run probably in the mid-4 range in the back half of the year. So, there's some improvement in the future. But I think the big move on contract labor from the highs of COVID really have been reflected now and what's to come is more incremental improvement as we continue to work on recruiting and retention. So that would be my -- I don't see anything other than that. It's material related to driving our labor trends. I mean productivity remains good. Wage inflation has been stable especially kind of coming off COVID and into 2024. So, those are the major things that we think about when we think about from now to the back half of the year.\nSam Hazen: And Mike, let me just put a wraparound that. I mean our focus now is finding ways to help our employees succeed even more at what they do. So, we are investing in education of our existing workforce just as much as we're investing in education and new nurses and so forth. We are improving our processes around supporting our caregivers so they can deliver better care. So, we have a number of initiatives that are connected to our nursing operations and so forth that really make sure that we have resources and support for our caregivers on a day in and day out basis. And we're investing heavily in our leadership because good leaders produce good outcomes for our patients and good outcomes for the organization. So those things are wraparounds to what Mike just alluded to. With respect to M&A, we have added to our platform this year with some tuck-in acquisitions from one market to the other. And Texas, as Mike alluded to, we added a number of hospitals to our North Texas market, small but very complementary. And we're starting to see good results out of them. In Houston, as an example, we added an outpatient business to our network there. That has produced a very good outcome. We are built to be bigger. We know that, and we have the balance sheet to support that. But we're very selective around making sure that an acquisition fits the model and can produce the returns that we expect from acquisitions. Will we enter new markets? Hopefully, yes, but those opportunities haven't necessarily presented themselves. I don't know that we'll deviate from our model. Our model is more centered on making our system -- our local system works better, work better for the community, work better for our patients and work better for other stakeholders that are connected to it. We obviously could do that, but we don't think that's the best answer for the Company. And that's been part of what we define as the durability of HCA Healthcare. It's staying true to the model in ways that produce a really good outcome for our stakeholders. It's possible that something will cause us to deviate from that, but we haven't really seen it up to this point. So, our focus is on investing back in our business, doing selective strategic acquisitions that complement our networks where we can and really advancing our position in these great markets that we serve.\nMike Marks: And one more comment on labor. The other thing that was very helpful for us in the -- not only in the quarter, but year-to-date is this 2% reduction length of stay. So, if you think about kind of how did we service almost 6% growth in inpatient volume on the admission side, 2% reduction length of stay. Sam mentioned this, we had a percent increase in our bed count from our capital investment program and then our occupancy levels were up 2%. But that 2% drop in length of stay and the ER efficiency that Sam mentioned earlier also supports our labor costs and the efficiency in the way we're managing our labor. So, I wanted to add that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJohn Ransom: Great job. Just curious, a question we're getting is, if you look at the back half, do you happen to have the DPP compare of '23 versus '24 in your back half?\nMike Marks: Here's what I would say about the guidance on the back half year. We talked about when we came this year that we thought we would have a headwind of $100 million, $200 million for Medicaid supplemental payment programs. As we've gotten deeper into this year, we're now kind of changing that or updating that to a $100 million to $200 million tailwind. So, if you think about that flip of $200 million to $400 million, I would tell you that much of that already occurred in the first half of '24. So, if you think about the back half of '24, what we're expecting for supplemental payment programs will look pretty similar to what we had in the back half of 2023.\nJohn Ransom: Okay. And if I could just sneak one more. M&A, what is the year-over-year M&A contribution to EBITDA? Because it looks like in your cash flows, M&A has been quite modest, but it looks a little bigger in your table. So, can we kind of -- and was that fully in your guide, the M&A effect when you guided for '24?\nMike Marks: It is. I mean, as I said earlier, if I think about M&A or another way to think of that is kind of new stores. It was -- for the second quarter is about a 1% dilution to EBITDA for the quarter in terms of the impact from M&A activity. That includes, by the way, Valesco. I mean I would note that Valesco moves into same-store in 2025 and so you'll see us kind of stop talking about Valesco next year. But that M&A was not a material impact related to our earnings for the quarter.\nSam Hazen: And Mike, as it moves through the last half of the year, it gets slightly better. And we're hopeful that by the end of the fourth quarter, it's not dilutive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is now open.\nJoshua Raskin: Just getting back to the exchanges. I heard 7% of admissions now are coming from patients with ACA exchange coverage. What does that translate into revenues? And should we assume that those patients carry margins that are typical of the broader commercial population?\nMike Marks: What we typically say about our health care exchange payer category, it's our second-best payer. It's below -- from a reimbursement level, it's below commercial. It's above Medicare. So, it's in between those. So, it would have margins less than your typical commercial margins, but better than Medicare would be roughly what we're talking about. So, on 7% of admissions, if you look at revenue, something like 9% of revenues.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sarah James of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\nSarah James: Can you give us some clarity if the commercial outpatient surgeries that were related to holidays in 1Q were rebooked? And then just taking a step back, if I look at outpatient surgical trends, first half last year was kind of mid-single-digit. Redetermination started and it dropped down to low single digits. Now, it's a negative 2% for first half of this year. So, is that like full change from the mid-single-digit first half last year to now be negative too, all related to Medicaid? And should we start to see that fall off in the back half of this year then as we start to anniversary some of the impacts?\nSam Hazen: Again, the volume declines on outpatient surgery are associated with Medicaid declines in that category as well as uninsured self-pay categories. So, both of those categories explained year-to-date, pretty much 100% of volume declines. I mean, there's a thesis inside of our company. It's not proven yet, that patients who migrated from Medicaid into the exchanges through the redetermination process, maybe in a different seasonality category with respect to when they access services. So that's a theory we have. We'll have to see how that plays out as we move through the balance of the year. But I think it's important to understand that the revenue growth -- the service level growth that we've seen in our outpatient surgery business has been solid and produced a pretty good financial outcome for the Company. And if, in fact, our thesis is accurate, it should be better in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. But again, we don't know that for sure. We need to experience this change in our business with this movement from one payer class to the other before we can land on that being the situation.\nMike Marks: Sarah, I would just add on Medicaid redeterminations. We're about one year into the redetermination process in most of our states. But you remember from last year, really started gaining speed towards the end of last year. So, I don't think you'll sunset or anniversary you're into the full Medicaid year-over-year comparison period until you get closer to the end of the year.\nOperator: This now concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to hand back over to Mr. Frank Morgan for final remarks. Thank you.\nFrank Morgan: Ellie, thank you so much for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We hope you have a great week and a successful earnings season. I'm around this afternoon, if I can answer any additional questions you might have. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for attending today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Sam Hazen",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everyone. The Company's results for the second quarter were positive across the board and reflected strong demand for our services. In addition, our teams continue to execute our strategic plan effectively and produced positive outcomes for our patients, while also enhancing in our facilities, including better throughput and case management. I want to thank our HCA colleagues for their outstanding work and their continued pursuits to innovate and deliver on our mission. As compared to the prior year, diluted earnings per share as adjusted increased 28% to $5.50. Consistent with the first quarter, we saw broad-based volume growth across our markets and service lines. On a same facilities basis in the second quarter, inpatient admissions grew 5.8%, equivalent admissions grew 5.2%, emergency room visits increased 5.5%, inpatient surgeries were up 2.6%, outpatient surgery cases were down 2% and like the first quarter, the declines were mostly explained by lower volumes in Medicaid and self-pay categories. Similar to the past few quarters, other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and inpatient rehab services experienced strong growth. Payer mix improved year-over-year with commercial volumes representing 36.2% of equivalent admissions. And lastly, the acuity of our inpatient services as reflected in our case mix index increased slightly as compared to last year. These factors helped generate same-facility revenue growth of 10%. Also in the quarter, we progressed further on our cost agenda and produced solid operating margins. As we transition to the last half of 2024, we are encouraged by the Company's results. We believe the increased investments we are making in our people and facilities along with our disciplined approach to operations will continue to produce positive outcomes for our stakeholders. In closing, given our year-to-date performance and the backdrop of strong demand that we forecast for the remainder of the year, we have updated our guidance for the year, as indicated in our press release. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for more details. So, on the volume, I think as I mentioned and Mike alluded to there, I mean our Medicare volumes were up, I think by 6.5%. So, the volume was supported really across all payer categories. Clearly, the exchange and the enrollment over the last three years or so has become a bigger component of the business but still relatively small in comparison to the other payer classes. But nonetheless, we did see good volume across all payer classes with the Medicaid, I think being the only category that was down. And seasonally, we do tend to drop from the first quarter to the second quarter because some of the payroll taxes that we have to absorb in the first quarter are consumed by the end of the quarter or the early part of the second quarter, and that tends to improve a little bit of our metrics simply because of the timing of those tax payments. Well, as Mike just mentioned, Brian, we do expect that these volume trends will continue throughout 2024. And we have had for -- including 2023, really solid volume growth. I think when we pull up and we look at volume for the Company and overall demand for our services, it starts with the markets that we serve. We are in markets, as we indicated at our Investor Day, that we think have solid characteristics that are going to support organic growth. That's the first thing. The second thing is the HCA network way. And that is how we build our network, how we execute inside of that. Our inpatient bed capacity is up 2% year-over-year. When you look at across all of our facilities, we've added a few hospitals in that as well, really small ones that are complementary. Our outpatient facilities overall are up 5%. So, our network development is a key part of our growth. And we think it's part and parcel to our ability to grow our market share, which we have grown, and we continue to see metrics that suggest our market share continues to be positive. The third thing for us is capital. We are investing heavily in who we are. We're investing in our network. We're investing in our people. We're investing in clinical technology for our physicians. And we're finding ways to use our capital to make our services better and produce better outcomes for our patients. So, this year, we'll invest somewhere around $5.2 billion, which is significantly up over the last couple of years, and we continue to see opportunities inside of our organization to invest capital. The next area, it's hard for us to know this, but we do believe that coverage -- when people are covered whether it's through the exchanges mostly, through their employers, through Medicare, they tend to purchase services. And so, coverage is up. So that helps elevate demand. And we are in really unchartered territories for growth in demand in a normal environment. And it's hard to know if there's a hangover from COVID, as we've mentioned in past calls and so forth, but we do believe the fundamental attributes of coverage help support demand growth. And then when you start looking across like we said earlier, the different payer classes, it's broad-based. It's broad-based across the different payers. It's broad-based across our services. I mean even obstetrics was up slightly in the quarter. So, we have seen just sort of a lift across all aspects of our business. And again, the diversification of HCA from market to market as well as the diversification from service allows us to participate in this demand growth, and we're pretty encouraged by what we see year-to-date and what we expect over the balance of this year. Well, this is Sam. Let me speak to our core strategy. And our core strategy is to create sort of a one stock capability within our systems. And by that, I mean, the ability to take care of a patient's need regardless of what their condition happens to be. So we, over time, have built complexity in the services that we've offered. So we've enhanced trauma programs. We've enhanced transplant programs. We've enhanced neonatal services. We've opened up our infrastructure with our transfer centers with helicopters, with ground transportation. We've interacted with the rural community in a way that support health care needs there, which typically tends to be more acute care service requirements than not. And so, all of that has been part and parcel toward our network strategy over the years. I will tell you, again, we had broad-based service growth in trauma in the number of ambulance deliveries that occurred at our hospitals, our cardiac care. Our cardiac surgery was up. So, we had -- neonatal admissions were up. All of these components that I mentioned that are essential to our network strategy saw growth. And so that has naturally lifted the case mix and the acuity of the patients that we serve. The two mid-night rule is actually dilutive when it comes to our case mix on the inpatient side. So, we jumped over the implications of the two midnight rules because those are lower acute patients deserve -- deserving to be in an inpatient status, but none the less than average equity by comparison. So, our quarter suggests that the acuity and the complexity of the services that we offer is even more than what it reports out simply because of the dilutive effect of the two mid-night rule. On the exchanges, Justin obviously, there's a lot to play out here politically between now and the end of the year. So, it's a little premature for us to forecast what's going to happen politically with respect to the exchanges. It's no secret that they are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. And many of the participants are in states that we serve, obviously, you've all seen that in the data that's available. We don't have a great line of sight on which participants in the exchange at what level of subsidies and how that will play out. It's really difficult for us to know precisely what that is. We are starting to try to study as much -- study. And we're hopeful that in 2025, we'll have some sense of the policies that might be put forth a better sense of the economics around the exposure if the subsidies go away. But at this point in time, it's way too early for us make any judgments on that. But we will be as transparent as we possibly can be with you all around it once we have information that we feel we can support and share appropriately. Okay. Let me start with the commercial ER growth. Our commercial volumes in the emergency grew almost 18%. So really strong growth in that category. Again, we are focused on throughput, patient satisfaction and high clinical performance with what we call our ER revitalization program. And our ER revitalization program has produced positive results for us. Our throughput, let's start with time to see a patient, is down two minutes. That didn't sound like that much. Well, we're moving from 11 to 9 minutes. That's the starting point. Our length of stay for patients who have been discharged is down, I think, about 15% to 20% to around 160 minutes or something in that zone. Again, throughput, getting the patient through the systems, communicating with them effectively and then getting them out when they're ready to be out. Then we have patients who are admitted. For those patients, we've also improved the hold time in the emergency room, so we can get them up to a floor and in a proper setting for care. And that also has improved markedly on a year-over-year basis. We have room to go. And we're continuing to invest in our leadership development. We're continuing to invest in technology. We put our care transformation and innovation team inside of our ER processes to help them think about different approaches. Our patient satisfaction has improved in our emergency room. And I want to say over 8 out of 10 patients would highly recommend or recommend an HCA emergency room. In addition to that, we're adding capacity. We've added capacity on our hospital campuses, but we've also added capacity off campus to really meet the needs of different communities and that's been part of our growth as well. We continue to invest in both aspects from a supply standpoint. And then we're investing heavily in our process standpoint to make sure that we're delivering the searches that our communities need and that our patients deserve. And I'm really proud of the effort that our teams have put forth. It was on outpatient surgery. Yes, I got it, right. So we were down in the quarter, 2% in the hospital on the same -- we back up, that's not same store here, sorry. Yes, we're a little over 2% on same stores and a little over 1% on ASCs. And that weighted out to about the 2% that we mentioned. Again, it's exclusively in Medicaid and uninsured. So, our overall revenue growth in our ASC and hospital outpatient surgery platform was up. Our profitability on that segment was up. And yes, we have a volume metric that's down, but the implications to our business really aren't there as a result of it. And then there's one on M&A. Let me add, Mike, if I may, it's Sam, to the capital. I think it's important to understand that we operate on an inpatient occupancy level in the mid -- low to mid-70s even in the second quarter, which is in addition to the fact that we added 2% inpatient bed as I mentioned. So our inpatient occupancy continues to grow, reflecting the acuity of our patients, reflecting the overall demand and reflecting the market share gains that we believe we're experiencing. The second piece is our ambulatory network development. Again, we have about 2,600 outpatient facilities and clinics across the Company, up 5% from where it was last year. Those are a component of our capital spending as well. And we will continue to look for opportunities from one market to the other to build out a network that serves our patients as we need to serve them. And the third piece is infrastructure. I mean we are in an infrastructure business. It requires us to have facilities that have the appropriate environment for our patients. We have to upgrade basic elements of those facilities and so forth. And so, a lot of that is maintenance. So, half of our capital goes towards maintenance to keep our facilities where they need to be. And then the last thing for us is technology. We are investing more in our technology agenda because we see opportunities for it to support the Company's next-generation growth and allow us to serve our patients even better. So, our technology component of our CapEx continues to grow. All of this is in the backdrop of our long-term view on demand. As we indicated in November at our Investor Day, we expect long-term demand to be in that 2% to 3% zone as well. And so, we have to build the necessary capabilities in our networks in our facilities to be able to serve that demand, and that's where our capital expenditure plan is intended to accomplish. We aren't going, Kevin, this is Sam, speak to 2025. I will tell you that we do not have any unusual event thus far through the first six months this year. This is core operations. And as Mike said, slightly by the Medicaid supplemental programs. So as sort of a core operational level of performance, it's really quite plain by comparison to some of the choppiness that naturally occurs with COVID, with the supplemental payment timings and so forth, with some of the challenges we experienced last year with just the inheritance of Valesco and so forth. But when we look at the first six months, and we think about the balance of the year, this is really a solid operational performance, supported by strong volume and not really unusual items benefiting or dragging the business in any material right. That's how I'd answer that question. And Mike, let me just put a wraparound that. I mean our focus now is finding ways to help our employees succeed even more at what they do. So, we are investing in education of our existing workforce just as much as we're investing in education and new nurses and so forth. We are improving our processes around supporting our caregivers so they can deliver better care. So, we have a number of initiatives that are connected to our nursing operations and so forth that really make sure that we have resources and support for our caregivers on a day in and day out basis. And we're investing heavily in our leadership because good leaders produce good outcomes for our patients and good outcomes for the organization. So those things are wraparounds to what Mike just alluded to. With respect to M&A, we have added to our platform this year with some tuck-in acquisitions from one market to the other. And Texas, as Mike alluded to, we added a number of hospitals to our North Texas market, small but very complementary. And we're starting to see good results out of them. In Houston, as an example, we added an outpatient business to our network there. That has produced a very good outcome. We are built to be bigger. We know that, and we have the balance sheet to support that. But we're very selective around making sure that an acquisition fits the model and can produce the returns that we expect from acquisitions. Will we enter new markets? Hopefully, yes, but those opportunities haven't necessarily presented themselves. I don't know that we'll deviate from our model. Our model is more centered on making our system -- our local system works better, work better for the community, work better for our patients and work better for other stakeholders that are connected to it. We obviously could do that, but we don't think that's the best answer for the Company. And that's been part of what we define as the durability of HCA Healthcare. It's staying true to the model in ways that produce a really good outcome for our stakeholders. It's possible that something will cause us to deviate from that, but we haven't really seen it up to this point. So, our focus is on investing back in our business, doing selective strategic acquisitions that complement our networks where we can and really advancing our position in these great markets that we serve. And Mike, as it moves through the last half of the year, it gets slightly better. And we're hopeful that by the end of the fourth quarter, it's not dilutive. Again, the volume declines on outpatient surgery are associated with Medicaid declines in that category as well as uninsured self-pay categories. So, both of those categories explained year-to-date, pretty much 100% of volume declines. I mean, there's a thesis inside of our company. It's not proven yet, that patients who migrated from Medicaid into the exchanges through the redetermination process, maybe in a different seasonality category with respect to when they access services. So that's a theory we have. We'll have to see how that plays out as we move through the balance of the year. But I think it's important to understand that the revenue growth -- the service level growth that we've seen in our outpatient surgery business has been solid and produced a pretty good financial outcome for the Company. And if, in fact, our thesis is accurate, it should be better in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. But again, we don't know that for sure. We need to experience this change in our business with this movement from one payer class to the other before we can land on that being the situation."

            "name": "Mike Marks",
            "content": "Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter showed continued solid performance with strong demand, improved margins and a balanced allocation of capital. Sam reviewed our top line results, so I will cover operating costs in the quarter. Operating costs were well managed, resulting in a margin improvement of 100 basis points to prior year and sequentially through the first quarter. Labor cost has improved 200 basis points from the prior year. And we continue to see good results in contract labor, which declined 25.7% from the prior year and represented 4.8% of total labor costs. Supply costs as a percent of revenues improved 50 basis points from the prior year. On other operating costs as a percent of revenue, they did grow compared to the prior year, but it remained relatively consistent for the past four quarters. We were encouraged that year-over-year same-facility professional fee costs growth moderated to approximately 13% in the second quarter, which compares favorably to the 20% increase we experienced in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.55 billion in the quarter, which represents a 16% increase over the prior year and included a modest benefit from Medicaid supplemental payments. As a management team, we are very pleased with the operational performance of the Company. Now moving to capital allocation. We continue to deploy a balanced strategy of allocating capital for long-term value creation. Cash flow from operations was just under $2 billion in the quarter, which is a decline of $500 million in the prior year, driven by income tax payments and timing of Medicaid supplemental program accruals and cash receipts. Capital expenditures totaled $1.28 billion, and we repurchased $1.37 billion of our outstanding share in the quarter. We also paid about $170 million in dividends. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range, and we believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective. Finally, in our release this morning, we are updating estimated guidance for 2024. For revenues, our new guidance range is $69.75 billion to $71.75 billion; net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, $5.675 billion to $5.975 billion; adjusted EBITDA, $13.75 billion to $14.25 billion; and diluted earnings per share, $21.60 to $22.80 per share. Based on the strength of our year-to-date results and our revised outlook, we estimate that share repurchases will be around $6 billion in 2024, subject to market conditions. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Frank, for questions and answers. Thank you, A.J., this is Mike. I'll take the supplemental question. I think as you're aware, Medicaid has historically been our most challenging payer, really other than patients without insurances, typically paying us significantly below the cost of carrying for Medicaid patients. Over the last several years, most states in which we operate have implemented or enhanced Medicaid reimbursement through supplemental payment programs. And while these supplemental programs are growing, it is important to put them in context. They can be complex, variable in their impact from quarter-to-quarter and when taken together with historical Medicaid reimbursement are still well short of covering the cost to treat Medicaid patients. We believe it is important to understand this backdrop when discussing these programs. But now to the quarter. In the second quarter, we recognized a year-over-year earnings increase of approximately $125 million related to our Medicaid supplemental payment programs driven primarily by the new program in Nevada and the accrual of the Florida program, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023. To your specific question about the new program in Tennessee, we -- that is with CMS for review, and we do not anticipate financial impact from that program in 2024. If you want to go to the public exchanges. For the quarter, and let me just kind of give commercial volumes in general first and then we'll kind of break out it. But our equivalent admissions for managed care, including our health care exchange volumes were up 12.5% in this quarter versus the prior year quarter. If you take our managed care volumes without health care exchanges, they were up just short of 5% on equivalent admissions. And for health care exchanges, we were up 46% over prior year for the quarter. And Medicaid were down 10% on equivalent admissions, mostly related to Medicaid redeterminations. Sure. Thanks, Ann. Contract labor was down 25.7% this quarter versus prior year quarter. As I noted in my opening comments, contract labor as a percentage of revenue -- I'm sorry, percentage of SWB was at 4.8% in the quarter. This compares to 6.8% in the second quarter of last year and almost 10% at the height of COVID in early 2022. So, we're continuing to see the improvements from all the work we're doing around recruiting and around retention, and that's paying the dividends in contract labor. If you think about kind of wage inflation, wage inflation was stable and kind of continues to run where we expected it to run. So also, we are pleased with our later results for the quarter. So, we're obviously really pleased with our year-to-date due performance. It kind of sets our thinking about the back half of the year. On the top line, our volume and payer mix for the first six months of this year were better than our original expectations. Solid labor management, as we just talked about, including the contract labor declines also contributed to our thinking around the kind of our results. As we move into the back half of the year, we believe most of these trends should continue. We anticipate volume growth to be in the 4% to 6% range for the year. We expect salary wages and benefits supplies and other operating expenses as a percent of revenue to run mostly where we did June year-to-date. Contract labor as a percentage of salary wage and benefits is projected to be in roughly in the mid-4% range in the back half of 2024. And we do expect professional fee expense growth to the prior year to moderate a bit more in the back half of 2024 as well. Specifically, on Medicaid supplemental payments, as you recall in our original guidance, we anticipate a headwind of $100 million to $200 million from the Medicaid supplemental programs. As we've noted previously, these programs are complex and have a lot of variability quarter-to-quarter. But given that we are now deeper into 2024 and have better visibility into the programs across our states, we now anticipate an approximate $100 million to $200 million tailwind in 2024 from Medicaid supplemental payment programs, most of which occurred in the first half of 2024. On same-store ASC revenue growth is about 8%. Yes. So, on the exchange volumes, they're just right at 7% of admissions and ER visits as well for exchange as a percent of total. What was the second question? If you look at wage inflation, as we kind of came in this year, we were thinking that 2.5% to 3% range, and that stays consistent as we think about where we are here and how we're going to kind of close to the back half of the year. So as -- thinking wage inflation will be fairly steady. So, there were some questions on M&A. Let me just kind of run through that. So, you have $400 million of revenue in new stores. About $250 million of that is from Valesco. The rest are from the acquisitions in Texas, you heard us talk about the Wise Healthcare System acquisition couple of others. And that's the revenue side of that. It was dilutive to earnings, though and about 1% negative impact to EBITDA for the quarter. So, the M&A trends don't really impact or did not really impact our year-over-year EBITDA growth in any material way. Yes, thank you. I'll take the second one first. We do see good sustainability around the Medicaid supplemental payment programs. As you noted, they're well supported historically, both in red states and blue states. And frankly, two of our biggest programs are in Texas, Florida. So that will give you a sense of those things. The new rule that came out earlier this year on sustainable programs, Medicaid supplemental programs, we found to be positive and supportive and actually good for the provider industry. If you think about kind of margins over time, if you go historically back in time, the Medicaid margins -- and you're right, I mean, supplemental payments are really just core to Medicaid, they were pretty significantly below the cost of caring for Medicaid patients in the past. Over the last several years, they have grown some and more states have added programs or enhanced programs. But even now, if you look at where we are in 2024, and you think about the historical base Medicaid reimbursement plus the supplemental payment reimbursement, it's still pretty well short of the cost of caring for those patients. So that's the context that we would provide on that. We are not really revising our CapEx. As we started the year, we talked about $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. We think it's still going to generally be in that same range. As noted in our comments, we do expect based on the improved outlook and the updated guidance that we're going to spend about $6 billion in 2024 on share repurchase. So, the bulk of the increase from the improved results would be going towards share repurchase. Sam, let me clarify real quick. I said $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. It's actually $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion in capital spending for 2024. Yes. So labor, as we've already said, the biggest driver, if you think about our performance in the first half of the year compared to prior year was this reduction in contract labor. And that kind of comes through all the work we've been doing over the last several years, improving our recruitment activities and really working on retention. On the recruitment side, you've heard us talk about our academic affiliation work, our work around the Galen School of Nursing. And all of that has kind of produced improved supply of nursing into our markets, which has been super beneficial. I do think from a contract labor perspective, we're -- as I noted in my comments, we're down to 4.8% of contract labor as a percentage of salary wages and benefits. And I do think that the go-forward improvement, we'll still have some. We've guided, as you've noted from my comment on guidance that we think we'll run probably in the mid-4 range in the back half of the year. So, there's some improvement in the future. But I think the big move on contract labor from the highs of COVID really have been reflected now and what's to come is more incremental improvement as we continue to work on recruiting and retention. So that would be my -- I don't see anything other than that. It's material related to driving our labor trends. I mean productivity remains good. Wage inflation has been stable especially kind of coming off COVID and into 2024. So, those are the major things that we think about when we think about from now to the back half of the year. And one more comment on labor. The other thing that was very helpful for us in the -- not only in the quarter, but year-to-date is this 2% reduction length of stay. So, if you think about kind of how did we service almost 6% growth in inpatient volume on the admission side, 2% reduction length of stay. Sam mentioned this, we had a percent increase in our bed count from our capital investment program and then our occupancy levels were up 2%. But that 2% drop in length of stay and the ER efficiency that Sam mentioned earlier also supports our labor costs and the efficiency in the way we're managing our labor. So, I wanted to add that as well. Here's what I would say about the guidance on the back half year. We talked about when we came this year that we thought we would have a headwind of $100 million, $200 million for Medicaid supplemental payment programs. As we've gotten deeper into this year, we're now kind of changing that or updating that to a $100 million to $200 million tailwind. So, if you think about that flip of $200 million to $400 million, I would tell you that much of that already occurred in the first half of '24. So, if you think about the back half of '24, what we're expecting for supplemental payment programs will look pretty similar to what we had in the back half of 2023. It is. I mean, as I said earlier, if I think about M&A or another way to think of that is kind of new stores. It was -- for the second quarter is about a 1% dilution to EBITDA for the quarter in terms of the impact from M&A activity. That includes, by the way, Valesco. I mean I would note that Valesco moves into same-store in 2025 and so you'll see us kind of stop talking about Valesco next year. But that M&A was not a material impact related to our earnings for the quarter. What we typically say about our health care exchange payer category, it's our second-best payer. It's below -- from a reimbursement level, it's below commercial. It's above Medicare. So, it's in between those. So, it would have margins less than your typical commercial margins, but better than Medicare would be roughly what we're talking about. So, on 7% of admissions, if you look at revenue, something like 9% of revenues. Sarah, I would just add on Medicaid redeterminations. We're about one year into the redetermination process in most of our states. But you remember from last year, really started gaining speed towards the end of last year. So, I don't think you'll sunset or anniversary you're into the full Medicaid year-over-year comparison period until you get closer to the end of the year."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir. \nFrank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we'll take questions. \n Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. \n On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare is included in today's release. \n This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam. \nSamuel Hazen: All right. Frank, thank you. Good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining the call. The positive fundamentals we saw in our business this past year continued into the first quarter of 2024. This momentum generated strong financial results that were driven by broad-based volume growth, improved payer mix and solid operating margins. As we look to the rest of the year, we remain encouraged by our performance, the overall backdrop of growing demand for our services and our enhanced stability across our networks to serve our communities. \n The people of HCA Healthcare continue to deliver for our patients with improvements in key nonfinancial metrics, including improved quality outcomes, more efficient process measures in emergency room services, which have accelerated time to discharge and increased satisfaction, and finally, better inpatient capacity management with reduced length of stay and increased acceptance of patients who needed to be transferred to our hospitals. \n As compared to the prior year, diluted earnings per share as adjusted increased almost 9% in the first quarter to $5.36. Same-facility volumes were favorable across the company. Inpatient admissions grew 6% year-over-year, inpatient surgeries were up almost 2%, equivalent admissions grew 5% and emergency room visits increased 7%. Most of our other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and rehab admissions, also had solid growth metrics in the quarter. \n While outpatient surgery revenue increased year-over-year due primarily to favorable payer mix, total cases declined 2%. We attribute most of this decrease to the effect of the calendar and the redetermination process, which drove a considerable decline in Medicaid volume. All the domestic divisions had growth in inpatient admissions and equivalent admissions. \n And finally, payer mix and acuity levels improved as compared to the prior year. Commercial volumes represented approximately 36% of equivalent admissions. Last year, they were 34% of the total. The case mix for our inpatient business increased slightly, continuing the upward trend we have seen over the past few years. Same-facility revenue grew almost 9% as a result of these volume metrics, coupled with 3.5% higher reimbursement per equivalent admission. \n We continue to make progress on our cost agenda. Operating costs across most categories were in line with our expectations. As part of our capital spending plan, the number of facilities or sites for care increased by almost 5% to around 2,600. And we added approximately 2% to our inpatient bed capacity. As we move through the remainder of the year, we will maintain a disciplined approach to our operations while continuing to invest appropriately in our strategic agenda, which we believe should position the company favorably to meet our long-term objectives. \n With that, I will turn the call to Bill for his last earnings call. I want to congratulate him again on his tremendous career with the company. It's been my privilege to work with him over these years, and I want to thank him for a job well done. \nWilliam Rutherford: Great. Good morning, everyone. And thank you, Sam, appreciate that. We believe our first quarter performance represents a strong start to the year, and we continue to combine solid operational performance with a disciplined and balanced allocation of capital to generate value over time. \n We had strong top line growth with revenues growing 11.2% over the prior year in the quarter. Sam highlighted the same-facility volume, acuity and mix metrics that drove our almost 9% same-facility revenue growth in the quarter. So let me highlight a few points on our operating costs. \n Overall, operating costs were managed well. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3% in the quarter. Labor results were solid with as-reported labor cost as a percent of revenue improving 100 basis points from the prior year. We continue to see good trends on contract labor, which improved 21.7% from the prior year and represented 5.1% of total labor cost. Supply cost as a percent of revenues improved 10 basis points from the prior year. \n While other operating costs as a percent of revenue has grown compared to the prior year, it has remained relatively consistent for the past 3 quarters. The sequential growth of professional fee expense contributed -- continued to moderate and performed in line with our expectations. In addition, the Valesco operations performed better than our expectations in the quarter. \n Adjusted EBITDA was $3.35 billion in the quarter, which represented a 5.7% increase over prior year. I will mention, as a reminder, we recorded a $145 million favorable settlement in the first quarter of last year. So we are pleased with the operational performance for the company during the first quarter. \n Next, let me speak to capital allocation as we continue to employ a balanced allocation of capital. Cash flow from operations was just under $2.5 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion. And we repurchased just under $1.2 billion of our outstanding shares during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range. And we believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective. And finally, in our release this morning, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 guidance ranges. \n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank and open it up for Q&A, and we look forward to your questions. \nFrank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. [Operator Instructions] Operator, you may now give instructions for those who'd like to ask a question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from [ Credit Suisse ]. \nAlbert Rice: Obviously, the inpatient side of the business was quite strong. I wondered if there were service areas that were particularly strong. Or was there anything else that you can highlight? I know at one point, as you talked about laying out the year, you thought maybe the first half comparisons would be stronger than the back half. I don't know if that's still your view. Any comment along those lines would be interesting as well. \nSamuel Hazen: A.J., it's Sam. As I mentioned, we had broad-based volume growth across the company. Every division had growth in inpatient admissions. Actually, we had the best portfolio performance, I think, I've seen in my experience in the company with 56 of our hospitals growing greater than 10%. So almost 1/3 of our portfolio grew by greater than 10%. We had another 1/4 of our portfolio grow greater than 5%, so really strong volume across the company broadly. \n When you look not only at the divisions in the aggregate but when you disaggregate the divisions, within our hospital portfolio, you see similar performance metrics. As far as services, the service line volume growth on the inpatient side was strong across the board. Even in obstetrics, we saw births grow on a year-over-year basis. And that's been down a little bit, so very broad-based from a service line standpoint as well. \n And then on the outpatient side, with the exception of outpatient surgery, and it's known to everybody that the calendar effects were not necessarily favorable, that influenced the outcomes on the outpatient surgery. But underneath our volumes on the outpatient surgery, as I mentioned, it was mostly Medicaid volume which we lost. \n And we think again that's due to the redetermination process. A working theory that we have is that some of those patients have migrated to the exchange or to an employer. And with co-pays and deductibles, maybe those cases are actually deferred because of that for some period of time. We just don't know at this point. \n But our overall profitability and revenue within our outpatient surgery business was up. So at the end of the day, the metric may look challenged, but the result was positive. So I would say that, as far as volumes, as we look toward the rest of the year, we do anticipate that the volume comparisons will be slightly more difficult. \n But we expect, as I mentioned in my comments, that the demand for health care over the course of the year will continue to be strong, and we will be able to sustain growth. It may not be at this particular level, but we're pretty encouraged by where we are from an overall competitive positioning standpoint as well as what we see as the backdrop of demand. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho. \nAnn Hynes: So I know, I think, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how Medicaid redeterminations was having a negative impact on volumes. Can you just quantify what you think the impact was? And then secondly, do you think you had a revenue benefit from the two-midnight rule in the quarter? \nWilliam Rutherford: Yes. Ann, this is Bill. It's hard to quantify. Regarding Medicaid redeterminations, we are doing our best to track that. We're seeing, just as we saw towards the end of last year, a large percentage of those people maintaining coverage, which I think is positive. Perhaps 20% of those we previously saw are not. And we're seeing a large portion of those end up in either HICS or employer-sponsored coverage. So we believe there is a small positive benefit here. And we're going to continue to monitor that over time on Medicaid redeterminations. \n On the two-midnight rule, I'd say it's still early. We are starting to see some encouraging signs. We do believe it's providing a modest benefit. We're seeing some of our two-midnight inpatient volume grow. And we think that's due to statusing in accordance with the new rules. But I'll emphasize it's still early and not all claims have completed the adjudication processes. But at this point, we still believe there's going to be a modest benefit from the two-midnight rule. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. \nPito Chickering: Can you talk about the OpEx pressure that you're seeing? Is there any else besides business expenses sort of going in there? And how should we think about OpEx as a percent of revenues using the first quarter as a launchpad? Does that continue to see pressure in 2Q? Does it level off at the back half of the year? And then any quantification of how Valesco is tracking better than expectations? \nWilliam Rutherford: Yes, Pito, this is Bill. Let me start. So I think there's two primary factors that are influencing the year-over-year comparisons in other operating costs. I'll emphasize it's been very consistent over the past 3 quarters though. And I think, first, as you know and recall from others that we began to see the pro fee pressures mostly in the second quarter of last year. So we're still looking at some year-over-year effect of that. We're pleased that we're at least seeing the sequential growth in pro fees begin to moderate as we have for the past several quarters. \n And I think the second contributor is just the expected increase in provider taxes related to the supplemental payment programs that we participate in. So those are really the two primary year-over-year contributors. And I think mostly, it was in line with our expectations. As we go forward, again I think for the past 3 quarters, the OpEx percent of revenue are relatively consistent and hopefully that will continue through the balance of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. \nBenjamin Mayo: It looks like there's about almost $500 million of revenue that's not in the same-store segment this quarter. You did modest M&A this quarter, less than $100 million, you spent. I mean, is the entirety of the almost $500 million the campuses that you acquired last quarter? Anything I'm missing? I'm just trying to figure out maybe the impact on margins. Because if those don't really have any earnings, that could be maybe like a 60, 70 basis point drag. So if you could help me out there, Bill, that would be helpful. \nWilliam Rutherford: Yes. Well, I think there's probably two. One, the Valesco operations would be in the non-same-store. And then we did acquire the Wise Health System in the last year. And that would be probably the other entity that's the difference between same-store and consolidated. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. \nBrian Tanquilut: Bill, thanks for all the help over the years, and congrats on the retirement again. Just my question on labor, you touched on Valesco a little bit. Any quantification you can share with us or expectation for further improvement both in Valesco and nurse staffing on temp labor? \nWilliam Rutherford: Let me start with Valesco. So as we've said in our year-end call, we anticipate the Valesco operations to kind of generate the same amount that we had in '23. But in '23, we had them for 3 quarters. Obviously, we'll have them for 4 quarters in '24. So again, I think that's resulting in some sequential improvement. But I think that's still good guidance for us is to basically be flagged on a full year basis. \n On the labor cost, we continue to be pleased with the trends in contract labor. The teams have a number of initiatives as we've seen. Turnover has stabilized, recruiting and hiring, still up. As I mentioned, our contract labor is down still 20% year-over-year. We think there's still more room to go as we go forward. So again, I think we're pleased, and we're again in a good position in overall labor trends. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. \nBenjamin Hendrix: Congratulations, Bill. Wanted to follow up on some of the mix commentary. You said you had some really strong commercial mix. I wanted to see kind of more detail on how exchange volume fits into that. I know you've talked about redetermination in Medicaid losses being offset, one pickup on exchange could offset three Medicaid losses. So just wondering kind of where we are on that recapture. And are we still on a lull? Or are we seeing enough exchange volume to kind of offset that? \nWilliam Rutherford: Yes, Bill. Let me start with that one. We are very pleased with the mix. We're seeing our overall managed care increase in the 12%, 13% range. That is fueled by health insurance exchanges. Our exchange volume was up close to 50% in the first quarter. \n The data we see, perhaps enrollment in our markets is up a little north of 30%. So our volume is a little higher than that. And I think that is probably attributable to redeterminations, at least a big chunk of that delta, as we are seeing some people who are redetermined off Medicaid landing in both employer-sponsored coverage as well as the HICS volume. \n Remind you, it's still roughly 6% or so of our borrowing. But we have seen really good growth in that. And so we're pleased with that. Hard to tell where we are in that cycle. I think we may be there in the end, at least to the state's redetermination process. But we're very pleased with the trends we're seeing so far. \n On the Medicaid redeterminations, as I said before, I think it has provided some benefit for us. We continue to track individuals that are presenting what their previous coverage was. And we're seeing the people who are being redetermined of landing in either employer-sponsored or HICS coverage. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gary Taylor from TD Cowen. \nGary Taylor: Bill, you'll be missed, so congrats. My two -- there were two numbers that really jumped out at me, so I just want to get your comment on those. The first is, I think, the occupancy number is all-time high you've reported or at least in the last decade. And I just want to think through, I mean, does that mean, I mean, we're peaking in terms of operating leverage on labor and other operating expense outside of professional fees? Could there still be more room on leverage? \n And then the other would just be same-store ER visits is up 7% versus a plus 10% comp. And we had a similar phenomenon last year, where we're up huge against a very tough comp in the first quarter and then that kind of moderated. And I'm just trying to think through if there's anything around ER seasonality that's new with redeterminations or ACA, SEPs or anything that numbers like that brings to mind for you. \nSamuel Hazen: Gary, it's Sam. I think we're actually pretty pleased with the occupancy levels. When you look at our operating agenda, our operating agenda is making sure, number one, that we have the staffing supply necessary in order to accommodate what we believe to be again a positive demand backdrop. And we've made solid improvements over the last 18 months in recruitment, retention, enhanced care models that really create a better environment for our patients. \n The second aspect to our capacity management and meeting the demand in the market is around our case management efforts. And our teams again have executed as normal inside of our company around whatever our imperatives are at a really high level. And we actually had acuity grow, as we mentioned, but length of stay went down. That allowed us to open up more beds, receive more patients in through our transfer centers and our emergency rooms and so forth. And that's not necessarily compromising our operating leverage. \n 1 quarter over 1 quarter is never a perfect proxy for the business. And so we're looking at the business sort of over a longer run. And with the exception of pro fees, which we believe will moderate over time, we will continue to see operating leverage in most scenarios when we have incremental volume because we have fixed cost in our labor platform, we have other fixed costs inside of our other operating expenses. So we are investing to add inpatient bed capacity. We had, I think, a little over 2% come online this year versus last year. We have a significant pipeline of capital that will help deliver more inpatient capacity over the next 2 to 2.5 years. So that's, that question. \n On the emergency room, when you look at the emergency room and look underneath the emergency room, our commercial emergency room visits were up 20% on a year-over-year basis. That is a really strong metric. We're down 10% in Medicaid, up slightly in self-pay, which speaks to the point Bill was making around redeterminations, finding a different level within the mix of our business. And so our emergency room business, obviously, we had 1 extra day, so we see the same level of emergency room business inside of the leap year dynamic this year. So that would pull it back in normal quarters. But we're encouraged about what's going on in our emergency rooms. \n We have a robust agenda there to revitalize the service levels because we've had a lot of dynamics coming out of COVID. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our service levels have improved. The process time for a patient to be seen as well as the process time for a patient to be discharged or admitted to the floor has improved markedly. Our patient satisfaction continues to improve on a year-over-year basis in our emergency rooms and also on a sequential basis. \n Additionally, we're investing in our emergency room platform both on-campus and off-campus. And those efforts are proving to be important to that particular service line as well. So the emergency room and our urgent care platform play a huge role in our overall network model. And we continue to be encouraged by what's going on in both areas. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. \nJustin Lake: Let me add my congrats to Bill on his retirement, really appreciate all your help over the years, bud. So my question was trying to get an update on your expectations for Medicaid, DPP and DSH. You reported the benefit here at $3.9 billion in 2023. I shouldn't say benefit, that's a gross number, I believe. \n Appreciate the increased transparency, was hoping you could give us an update on what you're expecting for 2024 on this metric relative to 2023. Maybe how much of that -- that's a gross number again. How much should we think of as kind of the net benefit there? And then can you go back, if you have the number handy, to 2019, pre COVID, pre kind of the big increase in some of these programs and tell us what the number looked like back then? \nWilliam Rutherford: Yes. Justin, let me try. And I think we'll have to get back to you on the '19, I don't have that upfront. But if I reflect back to our year-end discussion, that's still our belief today. First, just level set, these DPP programs are really fundamentally part of our Medicaid reimbursement. There's a lot of them. We have 18 or 19 states have these programs. But a lot of them have some complexity with a lot of variables associated. So use that as a backdrop.\n But we still believe when we look at the full year, there's going to be a modest headwind in the revenue to these programs, '24 versus '23, largely because of some settlements that we realized in '23, we do not expect to reoccur going forward. And so that's still our belief. In any 1 quarter, there may be factors that influence quarter-by-quarterly trends. But for the full year, we think there's still going to be a modest headwind on the revenue component that we have. \n Each state has a little bit different in terms of whether they're tax-based or contribution-based. So there are clearly operating expenses associated with the revenue number that you quoted that we disclosed within our 10-K. But the ratios have remained relatively consistent. And we'll have to maybe get back to you on the '19 levels, I don't have that handy. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays. \nAndrew Mok: I just wanted to echo congratulations to Bill. I just wanted to follow up on the comments you made on other OpEx. I think the year-over-year comparisons all make sense, given the timing of Valesco. But I'm still confused on the sequential progression from Q4. Because it sounds like Valesco performed better, physician fees moderated. \n And it was my understanding that supplemental payments would actually step down a bit from elevated Q4 levels. So I'm just trying to understand why we didn't see a larger decrease or more leverage on the other OpEx line, given those trends. Is there something that we don't understand or some other unexpected kind of item in that other OpEx line? \nWilliam Rutherford: No. I'd say we did have growth in our state supplemental payment expense quarter-by-quarter. As I said in Justin's response, there are certain variables that come on the timing of those. So sequentially, that was up. And the pro fees were up sequentially, it just was up small on there. \n So those are the two main factors to call out in the other operating is pro fees and the state supplemental payment. And I think when you look at sequentially, it makes sense, pretty much the trends were in line with our expectations, but nothing else there that I'd highlight. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America. \nKevin Fischbeck: So maybe two questions. I guess, one question, I guess, just about the guidance, I guess, there's been a lot of talk about how you guys are thinking about providing guidance. And you reaffirmed guidance in the quarter. I wasn't sure if that was trying to move away from providing an update every Q1 or whether that was -- you're actually reaffirming guidance because everything is exactly in line, so you're changing your communication around that without giving an update on that.\n But then second, just really about the volumes. Obviously, 3% to 4% volume for the year. You're above 5% to start. So does that imply that you're going to end the year more like 2%? And what we're seeing this year is 3% to 4%. How do you think about where volume will be in 2024 relative to that long-term trend line with the demand that you see in your markets? Are we maybe more or less back to that long-term trend line in 2024? Or is there still some room for that to kind of move up towards a longer-term trend line? \nWilliam Rutherford: Kevin, this is Bill. Let me start and I'll ask Sam to add in. On the guidance, we typically would not adjust guidance in Q1 in normal years. But as we talked in our year-end call and as we've tried to set the guidance ranges, I believe the ranges are wide enough to accommodate a range of outcomes. And so we want to get out of the trend, if you will, of trying to reset guidance every quarter-by-quarter. \n I think the long-term business trends that we've highlighted over the years and we highlighted in our Investor Day last year, we believe, are solid. They're kind of durable. And they've been pretty predictable over time. And our overall guidance is based on that. So we're not planning to adjust quarter-by-quarter unless there's material circumstances to warrant on either side of that.\n And on the volume trends, again, Sam can comment on here. As we've said, we're very pleased, very strong volume, very strong demand. And perhaps we do end up on the high side of our overall annual guidance. We'll remind you as we get into kind of the second half year-over-year comparisons, we started to see some volume -- positive volume trends in the third and fourth quarter last year. So the year-over-year comps will adjust a little bit. But we're very pleased where the volume trends are. And with these efforts, hopefully, we will end up on the high side. \nSamuel Hazen: Nothing else to add. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter, Wells Fargo. \nStephen Baxter: Just to hopefully put a bow on the Medicaid state-directed payment question, can you just remind us, are we at the point now that you're accruing these evenly each quarter in 2024? Is there any lumpiness to kind of keep in mind about the first quarter or the rest of the year? \n And then just to tie on to that, the final rule that got published earlier this week around this issue, do you feel optimistic that maybe more of your states kind of have more to do here? Or do you think maybe your states are doing a better job of proactively seeking these programs out? \nWilliam Rutherford: Yes, let me. There is some variability in the timing of when we recognize these. For the most part, programs we've had under a while were on an accrual basis. With new programs, we would typically wait until we get some established history and actually funds starting to flow. So it's a little bit of a mix. But there is some variability that we see as we go year-by-year. Remind people, previous to this year, we were recognizing Florida on an annual lump sum basis. We started accruing. We started a little bit, but we tried to accrue those as much as we can as we got some historical practices.\n Relative to the rule that was released earlier this week, it's still early. We're working our way through the assessment. But generally, we review it as positive. It removes the potential for some [ capi add-on ] payments. And there's a potential for changes in terms of how providers receive payments. It will take a little bit of time for states to work through those and implement it. But generally, we view that as a positive development for us. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla from Citi. \nJason Cassorla: I just want to follow up on labor. I know you're benefiting from reduced contract labor spend and the like. When we think about the first quarter SWB per just a patient day of about 3%, can you give us a sense of how wage growth trended in the quarter and then offsets on the productivity front that you're seeing and if there's anything within the first quarter that gives you confidence on your labor agenda kind of for the balance of the year? \nWilliam Rutherford: Yes, I mean, obviously, as we've talked about over the past year, we've got a lot of initiatives on labor and our teams are executing very well from turnover reductions to recruitment and retention efforts on there. And our core labor trends are in line with our expectations. We said we anticipate wage inflation in that 2.5% to 3% level. And we're starting to -- and we are seeing that. And that's helping to offset, and we continue to be pleased with the contract labor trends. So I would say the core labor trends that we are seeing this year are right in line with our expectations. And the initiatives that we have continue to be underway. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes, Bernstein. \nLance Wilkes: One follow-up on the labor question. And that's just if you could give any comment on hiring pipeline and if there are any categories where you're seeing either more appetite out there or any sort of constraints. And then my real question was on your comment on folks getting shifted over due to redeterminations and maybe that impacting outpatient surgeries. I was wondering if you're seeing any impacts of that sort of stuff on bad debt or any other things where perhaps the overall backdrop is impacting consumers here. \nWilliam Rutherford: Yes, let me attempt on that. Relative to the pipeline of labor, I don't know if there's any specific things I'd call out. I mean, obviously, we have diversity of geography, diversity of different employer cohorts. And labor teams are doing a great job. Our nurse hiring is up. And so I don't think there's anything unique I would call on that. And Sam or others can add in on that.\n And relative to the redeterminations and perhaps that influencing our outpatient surgery, I think both the combination of the HICS volume growth that we spoke about earlier, some of that due to the Medicaid redetermination, it is just a working thesis that perhaps there's a little bit more sensitivity on some of those elective procedures early in the year relative to deductible and co-pays. As Sam mentioned in his comments, almost all of our drop in outpatient surgeries was in Medicaid and self-pay levels. So we'll need a little bit more time to see how that plays out. And perhaps there will be some rebound on that as that begins to kind of normalize throughout the year.\n And on your question relative to the impact of that on bad debts, we're saying, no, I can't say we've seen any impact on that right now. There's still some of our self-pay growth are individuals that are in what we call a pending Medicaid status as we're pursuing eligibility efforts on there. But it has not yet resulted in any material change in our collectibility or bad debts at this stage. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. \nJoshua Raskin: Bill, I'll also add my congrats, and thanks for all the help. My question is just on CapEx. Could you speak to the CapEx and sort of the deployment in the quarter. It was down a tiny bit, so let's call it flattish year-over-year, but generally been trending higher in recent years. I guess, maybe there's obviously a lot of timing. And then any new capacity specifically to call out in the next 12 months? I know you've got a bunch of projects over the next sort of 2 to 2.5 years as well. \nSamuel Hazen: This is Sam. The amount for the quarter is flattish, to your point. And it is timing. We haven't slowed anything down. Some of our construction projects move at different paces than we anticipate at some level. But we expect for the year to be somewhere close to the number that we guided to last quarter, which is somewhere around $5.2 billion or so. So we're investing more in the business than we've ever invested because of the capacity that we need in the network development that we want. And so those efforts continue as we go through the course of this year.\n As far as any particular capacity that I would call out, I would tell you we have a new hospital in San Antonio, Texas that will open up later this year on the west side of that community. We're excited about that. We have other major projects on a host of campuses that will come online over the year. I think our bed capacity, when we conclude the year, will be somewhere similar to the growth that we experienced this year, which is maybe another 2% or so. \n As I mentioned previously, our emergency room capacity is also growing as we invest in new units or as we expand existing units. I don't have the number in front of me as to exactly how much we're anticipating there. But we're investing consistently as far as in the areas of our business. But we're investing more inside of those as a reflection of our overall spending.\n We also continue to invest in basic infrastructure in our facilities. Whether it's capabilities and technology for our nurses or surgical equipment and so forth, those investments continue again at elevated levels to improve the offerings for our physicians and patients. And so we have some increases embedded in that as well. So we're really excited about what we're spending our money on. And our patterns have proven that we can generate very positive returns. And we continue to believe that's the case. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Sarah James, Cantor Fitzgerald. \nSarah James: I was wondering if you could give us what the commercial outpatient surgeries were. Just with the moving pieces, I think we're all just trying to understand if that piece was where you expected it to be. I know it's coming off of a tough comp last year. But was it still positive like it was the last few quarters? \n And then Galen, I think, you guys are within a few weeks of your first graduating class. So just wondering strategically, how has that panned out? Did you get your share or better of the work commitments of the graduating class? \nSamuel Hazen: This is Sam. On the commercial side of outpatient surgery, I would say it's generally flat, so it performed better than the aggregate as a whole. Again, the calendar effects affected outpatient surgery in general. Specifically, it had a more dramatic effect on Medicaid, as we mentioned. But we aren't anticipating or seeing anything that's structural with our outpatient surgery business. And as I just mentioned, our capital spending has investments in our outpatient surgery platform as well.\n With respect to Galen, we have had graduating classes in the past. We continue to have larger ones as we expand that component of our organization. And one of our priorities within our facilities and within our nursing agenda is to integrate the Galen campuses into sort of the organization more effectively. And we are seeing incremental improvement in retaining those graduates within our company. And we continue to see opportunities for improvement there. It's really early to say it's completely solidified. We have numerous campuses that are in early stages of development. \n We will have again somewhere around 30 campuses by the end of 2027 with roughly 30,000 students across those campuses graduating somewhere between 7,000 or 8,000 per year, allowing us to pipeline and hopefully create a really good student experience, integrate them into the system through clinical integration and retain them when they graduate. So that's our strategy. And we're still early in seeing the effects of that. But we're encouraged by the efforts. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Cal Sternick from JPMorgan. \nCalvin Sternick: We've heard commentary from some others that January and February were strong from a volume perspective with some softening of demand in March. Can you talk about what you saw in the quarter? And then if you're seeing the expected rebound volumes into April? \n And if I could also just ask one clarification on the Medicaid supplemental payments, do you have any visibility right now into any retro programs that could come through in the second quarter? \nWilliam Rutherford: This is Bill, I'll answer the last one. No, we don't have specific visibility. There's always timing differences of certain aspects, but no specific visibility, no. \nSamuel Hazen: As far as the volumes, every quarter has calendar effects. And again, as I mentioned previously, we judge the business over a longer period of time to really understand what's working and what's not working. March was a difficult calendar for purposes of elective outpatient business and elective inpatient business simply because we had less working days, business days, and we had the Easter holidays during that time period. So it was clearly softer.\n We actually grew our inpatient admissions, however, in March. But our outpatient activity was soft and influenced sort of the aggregate for the quarter. We don't give guidance with respect to 1 month into the next quarter. I will tell you, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that we're encouraged by the overall backdrop of demand in our markets. \nOperator: And this concludes our Q&A session for today. And I would like to turn the call back over to Frank Morgan for closing remarks. \nFrank Morgan: Wally, thank you for your help today, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. We hope you have a nice weekend. I'm around this afternoon if you have additional questions. Give us a call. Have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Enjoy the rest of your day. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "William Rutherford",
            "content": "Great. Good morning, everyone. And thank you, Sam, appreciate that. We believe our first quarter performance represents a strong start to the year, and we continue to combine solid operational performance with a disciplined and balanced allocation of capital to generate value over time. \n We had strong top line growth with revenues growing 11.2% over the prior year in the quarter. Sam highlighted the same-facility volume, acuity and mix metrics that drove our almost 9% same-facility revenue growth in the quarter. So let me highlight a few points on our operating costs. \n Overall, operating costs were managed well. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3% in the quarter. Labor results were solid with as-reported labor cost as a percent of revenue improving 100 basis points from the prior year. We continue to see good trends on contract labor, which improved 21.7% from the prior year and represented 5.1% of total labor cost. Supply cost as a percent of revenues improved 10 basis points from the prior year. \n While other operating costs as a percent of revenue has grown compared to the prior year, it has remained relatively consistent for the past 3 quarters. The sequential growth of professional fee expense contributed -- continued to moderate and performed in line with our expectations. In addition, the Valesco operations performed better than our expectations in the quarter. \n Adjusted EBITDA was $3.35 billion in the quarter, which represented a 5.7% increase over prior year. I will mention, as a reminder, we recorded a $145 million favorable settlement in the first quarter of last year. So we are pleased with the operational performance for the company during the first quarter. \n Next, let me speak to capital allocation as we continue to employ a balanced allocation of capital. Cash flow from operations was just under $2.5 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion. And we repurchased just under $1.2 billion of our outstanding shares during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range. And we believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective. And finally, in our release this morning, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 guidance ranges. \n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank and open it up for Q&A, and we look forward to your questions. Yes. Ann, this is Bill. It's hard to quantify. Regarding Medicaid redeterminations, we are doing our best to track that. We're seeing, just as we saw towards the end of last year, a large percentage of those people maintaining coverage, which I think is positive. Perhaps 20% of those we previously saw are not. And we're seeing a large portion of those end up in either HICS or employer-sponsored coverage. So we believe there is a small positive benefit here. And we're going to continue to monitor that over time on Medicaid redeterminations. \n On the two-midnight rule, I'd say it's still early. We are starting to see some encouraging signs. We do believe it's providing a modest benefit. We're seeing some of our two-midnight inpatient volume grow. And we think that's due to statusing in accordance with the new rules. But I'll emphasize it's still early and not all claims have completed the adjudication processes. But at this point, we still believe there's going to be a modest benefit from the two-midnight rule. Yes, Pito, this is Bill. Let me start. So I think there's two primary factors that are influencing the year-over-year comparisons in other operating costs. I'll emphasize it's been very consistent over the past 3 quarters though. And I think, first, as you know and recall from others that we began to see the pro fee pressures mostly in the second quarter of last year. So we're still looking at some year-over-year effect of that. We're pleased that we're at least seeing the sequential growth in pro fees begin to moderate as we have for the past several quarters. \n And I think the second contributor is just the expected increase in provider taxes related to the supplemental payment programs that we participate in. So those are really the two primary year-over-year contributors. And I think mostly, it was in line with our expectations. As we go forward, again I think for the past 3 quarters, the OpEx percent of revenue are relatively consistent and hopefully that will continue through the balance of the year. Yes. Well, I think there's probably two. One, the Valesco operations would be in the non-same-store. And then we did acquire the Wise Health System in the last year. And that would be probably the other entity that's the difference between same-store and consolidated. Let me start with Valesco. So as we've said in our year-end call, we anticipate the Valesco operations to kind of generate the same amount that we had in '23. But in '23, we had them for 3 quarters. Obviously, we'll have them for 4 quarters in '24. So again, I think that's resulting in some sequential improvement. But I think that's still good guidance for us is to basically be flagged on a full year basis. \n On the labor cost, we continue to be pleased with the trends in contract labor. The teams have a number of initiatives as we've seen. Turnover has stabilized, recruiting and hiring, still up. As I mentioned, our contract labor is down still 20% year-over-year. We think there's still more room to go as we go forward. So again, I think we're pleased, and we're again in a good position in overall labor trends. Yes, Bill. Let me start with that one. We are very pleased with the mix. We're seeing our overall managed care increase in the 12%, 13% range. That is fueled by health insurance exchanges. Our exchange volume was up close to 50% in the first quarter. \n The data we see, perhaps enrollment in our markets is up a little north of 30%. So our volume is a little higher than that. And I think that is probably attributable to redeterminations, at least a big chunk of that delta, as we are seeing some people who are redetermined off Medicaid landing in both employer-sponsored coverage as well as the HICS volume. \n Remind you, it's still roughly 6% or so of our borrowing. But we have seen really good growth in that. And so we're pleased with that. Hard to tell where we are in that cycle. I think we may be there in the end, at least to the state's redetermination process. But we're very pleased with the trends we're seeing so far. \n On the Medicaid redeterminations, as I said before, I think it has provided some benefit for us. We continue to track individuals that are presenting what their previous coverage was. And we're seeing the people who are being redetermined of landing in either employer-sponsored or HICS coverage. Yes. Justin, let me try. And I think we'll have to get back to you on the '19, I don't have that upfront. But if I reflect back to our year-end discussion, that's still our belief today. First, just level set, these DPP programs are really fundamentally part of our Medicaid reimbursement. There's a lot of them. We have 18 or 19 states have these programs. But a lot of them have some complexity with a lot of variables associated. So use that as a backdrop.\n But we still believe when we look at the full year, there's going to be a modest headwind in the revenue to these programs, '24 versus '23, largely because of some settlements that we realized in '23, we do not expect to reoccur going forward. And so that's still our belief. In any 1 quarter, there may be factors that influence quarter-by-quarterly trends. But for the full year, we think there's still going to be a modest headwind on the revenue component that we have. \n Each state has a little bit different in terms of whether they're tax-based or contribution-based. So there are clearly operating expenses associated with the revenue number that you quoted that we disclosed within our 10-K. But the ratios have remained relatively consistent. And we'll have to maybe get back to you on the '19 levels, I don't have that handy. No. I'd say we did have growth in our state supplemental payment expense quarter-by-quarter. As I said in Justin's response, there are certain variables that come on the timing of those. So sequentially, that was up. And the pro fees were up sequentially, it just was up small on there. \n So those are the two main factors to call out in the other operating is pro fees and the state supplemental payment. And I think when you look at sequentially, it makes sense, pretty much the trends were in line with our expectations, but nothing else there that I'd highlight. Kevin, this is Bill. Let me start and I'll ask Sam to add in. On the guidance, we typically would not adjust guidance in Q1 in normal years. But as we talked in our year-end call and as we've tried to set the guidance ranges, I believe the ranges are wide enough to accommodate a range of outcomes. And so we want to get out of the trend, if you will, of trying to reset guidance every quarter-by-quarter. \n I think the long-term business trends that we've highlighted over the years and we highlighted in our Investor Day last year, we believe, are solid. They're kind of durable. And they've been pretty predictable over time. And our overall guidance is based on that. So we're not planning to adjust quarter-by-quarter unless there's material circumstances to warrant on either side of that.\n And on the volume trends, again, Sam can comment on here. As we've said, we're very pleased, very strong volume, very strong demand. And perhaps we do end up on the high side of our overall annual guidance. We'll remind you as we get into kind of the second half year-over-year comparisons, we started to see some volume -- positive volume trends in the third and fourth quarter last year. So the year-over-year comps will adjust a little bit. But we're very pleased where the volume trends are. And with these efforts, hopefully, we will end up on the high side. Yes, let me. There is some variability in the timing of when we recognize these. For the most part, programs we've had under a while were on an accrual basis. With new programs, we would typically wait until we get some established history and actually funds starting to flow. So it's a little bit of a mix. But there is some variability that we see as we go year-by-year. Remind people, previous to this year, we were recognizing Florida on an annual lump sum basis. We started accruing. We started a little bit, but we tried to accrue those as much as we can as we got some historical practices.\n Relative to the rule that was released earlier this week, it's still early. We're working our way through the assessment. But generally, we review it as positive. It removes the potential for some [ capi add-on ] payments. And there's a potential for changes in terms of how providers receive payments. It will take a little bit of time for states to work through those and implement it. But generally, we view that as a positive development for us. Yes, I mean, obviously, as we've talked about over the past year, we've got a lot of initiatives on labor and our teams are executing very well from turnover reductions to recruitment and retention efforts on there. And our core labor trends are in line with our expectations. We said we anticipate wage inflation in that 2.5% to 3% level. And we're starting to -- and we are seeing that. And that's helping to offset, and we continue to be pleased with the contract labor trends. So I would say the core labor trends that we are seeing this year are right in line with our expectations. And the initiatives that we have continue to be underway. Yes, let me attempt on that. Relative to the pipeline of labor, I don't know if there's any specific things I'd call out. I mean, obviously, we have diversity of geography, diversity of different employer cohorts. And labor teams are doing a great job. Our nurse hiring is up. And so I don't think there's anything unique I would call on that. And Sam or others can add in on that.\n And relative to the redeterminations and perhaps that influencing our outpatient surgery, I think both the combination of the HICS volume growth that we spoke about earlier, some of that due to the Medicaid redetermination, it is just a working thesis that perhaps there's a little bit more sensitivity on some of those elective procedures early in the year relative to deductible and co-pays. As Sam mentioned in his comments, almost all of our drop in outpatient surgeries was in Medicaid and self-pay levels. So we'll need a little bit more time to see how that plays out. And perhaps there will be some rebound on that as that begins to kind of normalize throughout the year.\n And on your question relative to the impact of that on bad debts, we're saying, no, I can't say we've seen any impact on that right now. There's still some of our self-pay growth are individuals that are in what we call a pending Medicaid status as we're pursuing eligibility efforts on there. But it has not yet resulted in any material change in our collectibility or bad debts at this stage. This is Bill, I'll answer the last one. No, we don't have specific visibility. There's always timing differences of certain aspects, but no specific visibility, no."

            "name": "Samuel Hazen",
            "content": "All right. Frank, thank you. Good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining the call. The positive fundamentals we saw in our business this past year continued into the first quarter of 2024. This momentum generated strong financial results that were driven by broad-based volume growth, improved payer mix and solid operating margins. As we look to the rest of the year, we remain encouraged by our performance, the overall backdrop of growing demand for our services and our enhanced stability across our networks to serve our communities. \n The people of HCA Healthcare continue to deliver for our patients with improvements in key nonfinancial metrics, including improved quality outcomes, more efficient process measures in emergency room services, which have accelerated time to discharge and increased satisfaction, and finally, better inpatient capacity management with reduced length of stay and increased acceptance of patients who needed to be transferred to our hospitals. \n As compared to the prior year, diluted earnings per share as adjusted increased almost 9% in the first quarter to $5.36. Same-facility volumes were favorable across the company. Inpatient admissions grew 6% year-over-year, inpatient surgeries were up almost 2%, equivalent admissions grew 5% and emergency room visits increased 7%. Most of our other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and rehab admissions, also had solid growth metrics in the quarter. \n While outpatient surgery revenue increased year-over-year due primarily to favorable payer mix, total cases declined 2%. We attribute most of this decrease to the effect of the calendar and the redetermination process, which drove a considerable decline in Medicaid volume. All the domestic divisions had growth in inpatient admissions and equivalent admissions. \n And finally, payer mix and acuity levels improved as compared to the prior year. Commercial volumes represented approximately 36% of equivalent admissions. Last year, they were 34% of the total. The case mix for our inpatient business increased slightly, continuing the upward trend we have seen over the past few years. Same-facility revenue grew almost 9% as a result of these volume metrics, coupled with 3.5% higher reimbursement per equivalent admission. \n We continue to make progress on our cost agenda. Operating costs across most categories were in line with our expectations. As part of our capital spending plan, the number of facilities or sites for care increased by almost 5% to around 2,600. And we added approximately 2% to our inpatient bed capacity. As we move through the remainder of the year, we will maintain a disciplined approach to our operations while continuing to invest appropriately in our strategic agenda, which we believe should position the company favorably to meet our long-term objectives. \n With that, I will turn the call to Bill for his last earnings call. I want to congratulate him again on his tremendous career with the company. It's been my privilege to work with him over these years, and I want to thank him for a job well done. A.J., it's Sam. As I mentioned, we had broad-based volume growth across the company. Every division had growth in inpatient admissions. Actually, we had the best portfolio performance, I think, I've seen in my experience in the company with 56 of our hospitals growing greater than 10%. So almost 1/3 of our portfolio grew by greater than 10%. We had another 1/4 of our portfolio grow greater than 5%, so really strong volume across the company broadly. \n When you look not only at the divisions in the aggregate but when you disaggregate the divisions, within our hospital portfolio, you see similar performance metrics. As far as services, the service line volume growth on the inpatient side was strong across the board. Even in obstetrics, we saw births grow on a year-over-year basis. And that's been down a little bit, so very broad-based from a service line standpoint as well. \n And then on the outpatient side, with the exception of outpatient surgery, and it's known to everybody that the calendar effects were not necessarily favorable, that influenced the outcomes on the outpatient surgery. But underneath our volumes on the outpatient surgery, as I mentioned, it was mostly Medicaid volume which we lost. \n And we think again that's due to the redetermination process. A working theory that we have is that some of those patients have migrated to the exchange or to an employer. And with co-pays and deductibles, maybe those cases are actually deferred because of that for some period of time. We just don't know at this point. \n But our overall profitability and revenue within our outpatient surgery business was up. So at the end of the day, the metric may look challenged, but the result was positive. So I would say that, as far as volumes, as we look toward the rest of the year, we do anticipate that the volume comparisons will be slightly more difficult. \n But we expect, as I mentioned in my comments, that the demand for health care over the course of the year will continue to be strong, and we will be able to sustain growth. It may not be at this particular level, but we're pretty encouraged by where we are from an overall competitive positioning standpoint as well as what we see as the backdrop of demand. Gary, it's Sam. I think we're actually pretty pleased with the occupancy levels. When you look at our operating agenda, our operating agenda is making sure, number one, that we have the staffing supply necessary in order to accommodate what we believe to be again a positive demand backdrop. And we've made solid improvements over the last 18 months in recruitment, retention, enhanced care models that really create a better environment for our patients. \n The second aspect to our capacity management and meeting the demand in the market is around our case management efforts. And our teams again have executed as normal inside of our company around whatever our imperatives are at a really high level. And we actually had acuity grow, as we mentioned, but length of stay went down. That allowed us to open up more beds, receive more patients in through our transfer centers and our emergency rooms and so forth. And that's not necessarily compromising our operating leverage. \n 1 quarter over 1 quarter is never a perfect proxy for the business. And so we're looking at the business sort of over a longer run. And with the exception of pro fees, which we believe will moderate over time, we will continue to see operating leverage in most scenarios when we have incremental volume because we have fixed cost in our labor platform, we have other fixed costs inside of our other operating expenses. So we are investing to add inpatient bed capacity. We had, I think, a little over 2% come online this year versus last year. We have a significant pipeline of capital that will help deliver more inpatient capacity over the next 2 to 2.5 years. So that's, that question. \n On the emergency room, when you look at the emergency room and look underneath the emergency room, our commercial emergency room visits were up 20% on a year-over-year basis. That is a really strong metric. We're down 10% in Medicaid, up slightly in self-pay, which speaks to the point Bill was making around redeterminations, finding a different level within the mix of our business. And so our emergency room business, obviously, we had 1 extra day, so we see the same level of emergency room business inside of the leap year dynamic this year. So that would pull it back in normal quarters. But we're encouraged about what's going on in our emergency rooms. \n We have a robust agenda there to revitalize the service levels because we've had a lot of dynamics coming out of COVID. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our service levels have improved. The process time for a patient to be seen as well as the process time for a patient to be discharged or admitted to the floor has improved markedly. Our patient satisfaction continues to improve on a year-over-year basis in our emergency rooms and also on a sequential basis. \n Additionally, we're investing in our emergency room platform both on-campus and off-campus. And those efforts are proving to be important to that particular service line as well. So the emergency room and our urgent care platform play a huge role in our overall network model. And we continue to be encouraged by what's going on in both areas. Nothing else to add. Thank you. This is Sam. The amount for the quarter is flattish, to your point. And it is timing. We haven't slowed anything down. Some of our construction projects move at different paces than we anticipate at some level. But we expect for the year to be somewhere close to the number that we guided to last quarter, which is somewhere around $5.2 billion or so. So we're investing more in the business than we've ever invested because of the capacity that we need in the network development that we want. And so those efforts continue as we go through the course of this year.\n As far as any particular capacity that I would call out, I would tell you we have a new hospital in San Antonio, Texas that will open up later this year on the west side of that community. We're excited about that. We have other major projects on a host of campuses that will come online over the year. I think our bed capacity, when we conclude the year, will be somewhere similar to the growth that we experienced this year, which is maybe another 2% or so. \n As I mentioned previously, our emergency room capacity is also growing as we invest in new units or as we expand existing units. I don't have the number in front of me as to exactly how much we're anticipating there. But we're investing consistently as far as in the areas of our business. But we're investing more inside of those as a reflection of our overall spending.\n We also continue to invest in basic infrastructure in our facilities. Whether it's capabilities and technology for our nurses or surgical equipment and so forth, those investments continue again at elevated levels to improve the offerings for our physicians and patients. And so we have some increases embedded in that as well. So we're really excited about what we're spending our money on. And our patterns have proven that we can generate very positive returns. And we continue to believe that's the case. This is Sam. On the commercial side of outpatient surgery, I would say it's generally flat, so it performed better than the aggregate as a whole. Again, the calendar effects affected outpatient surgery in general. Specifically, it had a more dramatic effect on Medicaid, as we mentioned. But we aren't anticipating or seeing anything that's structural with our outpatient surgery business. And as I just mentioned, our capital spending has investments in our outpatient surgery platform as well.\n With respect to Galen, we have had graduating classes in the past. We continue to have larger ones as we expand that component of our organization. And one of our priorities within our facilities and within our nursing agenda is to integrate the Galen campuses into sort of the organization more effectively. And we are seeing incremental improvement in retaining those graduates within our company. And we continue to see opportunities for improvement there. It's really early to say it's completely solidified. We have numerous campuses that are in early stages of development. \n We will have again somewhere around 30 campuses by the end of 2027 with roughly 30,000 students across those campuses graduating somewhere between 7,000 or 8,000 per year, allowing us to pipeline and hopefully create a really good student experience, integrate them into the system through clinical integration and retain them when they graduate. So that's our strategy. And we're still early in seeing the effects of that. But we're encouraged by the efforts. As far as the volumes, every quarter has calendar effects. And again, as I mentioned previously, we judge the business over a longer period of time to really understand what's working and what's not working. March was a difficult calendar for purposes of elective outpatient business and elective inpatient business simply because we had less working days, business days, and we had the Easter holidays during that time period. So it was clearly softer.\n We actually grew our inpatient admissions, however, in March. But our outpatient activity was soft and influenced sort of the aggregate for the quarter. We don't give guidance with respect to 1 month into the next quarter. I will tell you, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that we're encouraged by the overall backdrop of demand in our markets."
