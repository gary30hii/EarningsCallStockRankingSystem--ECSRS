At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by welcoming a couple new members to our executive team. First, in January, we announced the appointment of Maryann Mannen as our new CFO. She joins us having spent nearly a decade as a CFO in the energy services and manufacturing sectors. Maryann brings the financial acumen and strategic leadership expertise critical for delivering our business transformation objectives, including strict capital discipline and overall expense management to lower our cost structure. I'm excited for the perspective and business insights she will add to our executive team as we work together to continue strengthening our financial and competitive position. Yesterday, we announced Brian Davis has joined the company in our newly created role of Chief Commercial Officer. Brian has spent over three decades in the industry. His extensive commercial experience, his recent deep background in renewables and alternative energy and a track record of developing and enhancing capabilities is highly complementary to our strategic focus on improving our commercial performance. We look forward to his leadership in developing and implementing a holistic and integrated strategy for MPC's commercial business. These additions will be integral in supporting our strategic initiatives as we progress through 2021 and beyond. Before we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief business update. The unprecedented challenges this year created by the COVID pandemic accelerated the need for us to act swiftly and decisively to change how we conduct our business. The three initiatives highlighted on the slide focus on the aspects of our business within our control, strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance and lowering our cost structure. During the year, we've been faced with many tough decisions, but our team continues to make tangible progress in all three initiatives in ways we believe will drive stronger through cycle earnings and position the company for long-term success. Slide #5 highlights some of our actions taken around our strategic priorities this quarter. First, we continue progressing the sales of Speedway business. During the quarter, we responded to the second request from the FTC and continue to support 7-Eleven in its efforts to secure antitrust clearance. Our interactions with 7-Eleven and our interactions with the FTC have gone well.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Slide 9 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.94. This reflects pre-tax adjustments of $851 million, driven primarily by a $1.2 billion pre-tax lower of cost or market inventory benefit. These adjustments can be found in detail on Slide 29 in the appendix.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks Maryann. I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership. Last quarter, we discussed the recent publication of our 2020 Climate Perspectives Report highlighting opportunities in strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. We also discussed our goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and freshwater withdrawal intensities. It's important that we set objectives for the organization to driver our continuous improvement on ESG. Our principles for leading and sustainable energy position us to deliver strong results in the space from lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency in conserving natural resources to increasing renewable fuels production and embracing innovation and deploying advanced technologies. We believe the goals we are setting and our transparent disclosures on how we plan to achieve them place Marathon at the leading edge of our industry. We're seeing recent improvements in our ESG ratings reflecting our hard work in the area. Slide 20 in the appendix highlights to some of these accomplishments. Our approach to sustainability also reflects our commitment to create shared value with our stakeholders, the communities where we operate, our people, our business partners and many others. How we conduct our business enhances the performance we deliver. We look forward to even further expanding our robust engagement with stakeholders and continuing to serve as a valued partner. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike.  As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. We will now open the line to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question will come from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDoug Terreson: Good morning, everybody.\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: Mark, I have a market outlook question refining and specifically, it looks like inventories for both gasoline and distillate are headed towards normal levels by the end of this quarter, which may be why refining margins are returning to -- have returned to near year ago levels. And if we see OPEC raise output later in the year, which also seems likely, we could also get some help on feedstock differentials. So my question is whether you're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing in products markets and the pace of the recovery as well and also whether you think this will be sustainable?\nMike Hennigan: Yeah, thanks, it's a good question. Before I answer and I'll let some other members of the team jump in as well. I first want to say, I appreciate your insights over the years and I want to congratulate you specifically on your next steps in your career and thank you for your contributions to our industry.\nDoug Terreson: Well, thank you, Mike. You guys have been easy to support for sure. The pleasure has been all mine.\nMike Hennigan: On your question as far as go forward, I think, you mentioned a lot of things that we're looking at. And I guess our term is cautious optimism. For me, specifically, I tend to try not to call the market, but really call the banks of the rivers more. And on the positive side, some of the things that you mentioned that we're clearly seeing and we have that I call it cautious optimism as a result, hopefully, vaccinations will go smooth and hopefully we'll come out of this pandemic in a robust way. So that's kind of the bull view. And then the bear case is, we saw towards the end of last year, cases were going up, restrictions started to kick in a little bit more and we saw what a lot of people anticipated, which was a tough December and into January. Now we\u2019re approaching February and will head into the spring. So for us, there's a bull case that says things are moving in the right direction. There's a bear case that says we're not through with this pandemic yet and we got some more fuel to play through before we really see the end of it. But let me - I am going to let Tim comment on gasoline a little bit and Brian can comment on the other projects, just so we can get a sense of what we see in the market today. Tim?\nTim Griffith: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Doug, the \u2013 just to reitereate Mike\u2019s comments, I mean, we did see a little bit of softness into the back half of the year really after Thanksgiving and really through the end of year, almost a step down with regard to demand and again a lot of it relating to higher case rates. What we'll see, we're seeing a couple of bright spots early in the year, but we're hoping for more. We think this is probably going to take some time. As Mike said, we really need to get the immunization protocol built and as a country accelerate that process to get more and more people comfortable and then ultimately get schools back in session, get people back in the office, get people back on the roads, improve discretionary travel and we think that's going to happen, but that may take some time. And I think we're going to be sort of patient over the course of the year to see that really bear fruit. But definitely better times ahead. We just think it's going to take a little bit of time to really see that. I mean, for the first quarter, I think based on the year-over-year, we're probably going to be 90% of last year's volumes at the retail gasoline level and again, hope to see improvement over the continued -- over the rest of 2021.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. And then also, Mike, a few minutes ago, you talked about strategic focus and commitment to corporate responsibility as being key elements. And so that makes it kind of clear to me that your leadership team believes that we may be experiencing a paradigm shift in energy may be more so than we've had in the past. And so my question is, first of all, do you agree? And second, what are some of the things that the management team needs to do to stay on the leading-edge in the industry which I think was a phrase you used a minute ago in this new environment?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. It's a really good question, Doug. So first off, all yes, we do believe that there is a paradigm shift occurring. I like the word energy evolution. So we see that occurring. And I guess, the momentum toward the low-carbon future is obvious. We're focused on how we position ourselves. As you mentioned, I felt that we had to get some things in line relative to cost and looking at our portfolio. But our focus on cost is essential in addition to our lower carbon intensity company to remain competitive for the long-term as these scenarios start to play themselves out. As you mentioned, we have made a commitment in sustainable energy and partly that comes from lowering the carbon intensity of our assets and increasing our exposure in renewable fuels production and we can talk about that a lot more detail today, but we have our Dickinson facility up and running and raise working through the start up there. And then we're still very optimistic about what Martinez can bring to us in that area. And then we're hopeful as technologies advance that we're on top of that and commercially and responsibly put ourselves in a position for the future. So I do agree with your belief that it is a paradigm shift. I do believe there's going to be increasing momentum towards low carbon. Obviously, everybody sees that occurring through the administration\u2019s announcements as well as many other companies coming out. And our goal is to stay focused on that change and put Marathon in the best position to be a long-term player in that energy evolution.\nDoug Terreson: Thanks again, everybody.\nMike Hennigan: Thank you, Doug, and again congratulations on your next step.\nDoug Terreson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team, and congrats on some better-than-expected results here. I guess, the first question is just to build on that is, is refining cost came in certainly better than what we were expecting. And in the 2021 standalone capital spending surprised as well to the downside and that was largely at refining as well. So can you talk about both of those, the CapEx and the OpEx improvements and how much of it is cyclical given that you still are running at depressed utilization although maybe a little bit better than what we had anticipated based on the guide and how much of it is structural and that will carry forward as we recover from here?\nMike Hennigan: Hey, Neil, thanks for that question. So, obviously, we've been very focused on cost. I stated that throughout 2020 that we needed to make a step change. And in refining, particularly, Ray and his team have taken that and put some really good actions in place. So I'll let him comment in a second. But overall, I think, what you're seeing from us is trying to reset our overall cost structure whether it's in the corporate area or midstream or refining. To your point, we do expect over time as we get past the pandemic for variable cost to come up a little bit. At the same time, we believe that many of the cost reductions that we have in place are structural. They're fixed cost in nature. Obviously, we're hopeful that we have more variable cost and that the demand for our product comes back up. But I think you\u2019ve seen, over the last couple of quarters, a pretty sustainable step change and that's what we're hoping to show the market. As far as capital Neil, what we're doing there is pivoting to what Doug just referred to as a new paradigm. We have a bunch of projects that are already in progress in refining that we'll continue to finish those out. Examples of that would be like the Star project we have going on down in the Gulf Coast. That's an important project for us. It's still going to take some time to get through, but at the end of the day, we're going to do those projects that we think are in progress and are still valued. We're going to look for projects in refining that lower our costs going forward or change the dynamic we have around this energy evolution and then obviously, pivot more into the renewable space. We've a bunch of things planned for both Dickinson and Martinez. As kind of the first step in this energy evolution, renewables is the hot topic and I think we're in a real good position to put ourselves in a good spot there. So Ray, do you have anything you want to add or\u2026\nRay Brooks: Sure Mike, Neil, I'll just give a little bit more color on the OpEx and this should be fairly consistent with what we talked about during the last earnings call but for OpEx reductions in refining, it wasn't just one thing, it was a multitude of things, but if I had a key on two items, I would say the first is scrutinizing the number of people in our facilities. This is both contractors and employees and just looking at the number of people we have, the number of projects we were working on and so forth and not just cutting people but also consolidating contractor companies and really taking a deficiency look at that. The other thing that we really wanted to do and our procurement supply chain group did a phenomenal job of working with us is making sure that we really leverage to spend across our 2.9 million barrel day of refining system. So looking at all of our contracts, goods and services and making sure that we just had the best terms and best contracts out there, just wanted to jump on what Mike said earlier to is our goal is to make sure that these reductions are structural as possible. Early on in the pandemic, we did some deferral activity with turnarounds, but largely that was to get out of the initial period of March, April, May timeframe but since then, we've caught up on our turnaround work and going into this year we'll do more of the same. So that's just a little bit more color on OpEx.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks guys and a follow-up is just on the transaction of the Speedway transaction. Can you walk us through what are the gating items to close the deal? Your conviction level that you concluded in Q1 and Mike I've asked this question so many times over the last couple months, but can you just walk through the waterfall again of how you get $16.5 billion of the cash coming in plus another $1.2 billion or so from the government and based on where your debt level is, what the ballpark ability to return capital to shareholders is to that framework? So two questions there, deal gating factors and then return of capital framework?\nMike Hennigan: Yeah Neil on the first one the major gating factor is the FTC process with 7-Eleven, so we're watching the process, we're contributing where we can as needed, but that's really a process between 7-Eleven and the FTC. What we know as of today it continues to go well and like I say, I use the word were targeting for the end of Q1 or we're hopeful that the end of Q1 is the right timing, but really the gating item is essentially that process that is not really our processes it's more 7-Eleven in the FTC. So we're supporting it where we can. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we responded to questions, we're supporting it as much as we can. The other activities that we have to get accomplished, which we're very confident we'll get done is the transition services. Obviously it's a major transaction between us and 7-Eleven and there are some services that Marathon is going to transition to 7-Eleven over time. So that's been a lot of the internal work that we've been doing recently. But the bottom line and I know everybody keeps asking about your use of proceeds, we're as anxious as anybody to get to that spot, but at the end of the day, the major gating item is we don't have control of that timing. All we can do is continue to give you the best insight we have and right now we still say we're hopeful its end of first quarter. We're targeting that. We think that's achievable based on what we know. So that our best guidance at this point. On your second issue, as far as the use of proceeds, we've tried as best we can to frame what we believe is the two main pillars that we're going to be targeting, which is getting the balance sheet back to where we want it to be and then return capital to our shareholders as quickly and as efficiently as we can and on the first issue, we've tried to make the statement that our debt situation majorities is there's about $2.5 billion the comes with your essentially minimal friction cost and we'll jump on that one right away. Right today, we have a little over $11 billion of debt. We'll continue to try and evaluate as everybody wants to know where is mid-cycle going to be etcetera, etcetera. We need to work with the agencies so our financial team, Mary Ann and Tom and the treasury team will work with the agencies as to the proper path to bring that debt down to a level that we think is the right spot. In an effort to try and give as much color as we can, we've kind of said to people that hey we don't see it going below $5 billion and that's kind of like our low refining case if you want to call that. So if you say in that regard, we have about a little over $11 billion. We don't see it going below $5 billion. So a number of the put on the piece of paper is around $6 billion depending on how well the recovery is and how quick the recovery is and working with the agencies etcetera. Absent that, we said we're going to return capital, we've talked about what's the best way to do that and the only reason we don't give additional color there is because at least in our mind, we believe right now is end of March is the targeted timeframe. So we have another 60 days to go and we'll continue to evaluate the market and the opportunities and we've been going through this internally with our board, with our advisors, with ourselves and we have a pretty good framework, but we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves in case it takes a little longer than we were expecting. So we do want to return that capital to shareholders. I personally am a believer that refining to a large extent is a return of capital business. We got to position ourselves where we're generating cash and then think about the best way to create value returning it to shareholders and we've talked about all the various ways to do that. It's predominately in a buyback type mode, that's what we're thinking about and then there's pros and cons to the various ways that you can do that and then our commitment is once we get close enough that we know we're there then we'll come on publicly and give a little bit more color as to how we think that'll affect itself, but our goal is as efficiently and as quickly and effectively as we can, we want to try and provide that return of capital.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Legate with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nDoug Legate: Mike, you're going to head in for this, I am going to bleat on about the same issue of my first question and I am going to hold of Mike or Ray for this and really I want to preserve some very quick marks with you and make sure I am think about this right. So your market comp is about $30 billion, your share of MPLX two thirds is about $16 billion. So let's assume in some of the parts spaces, the value recognized for everything else is about $14 billion and you're potentially going to have a $10 billion share buyback program if our net charge is $6 billion of debt pay down. But those are pretty enormous numbers obviously. So first of all am I thinking about right and secondly, how exactly would you expect to deploy such a scale of a buyback which I guess is Neil's question and I'm thinking along the lines of what the deal regular acquisition of shares in the market, what are you actually thinking about structure and timing because those numbers are obviously pretty significant when you look at it that way?\nMike Hennigan: Doug, first of all I don\u2019t hate you for asking the question. It's a fair question and I know you've asked a few times about do we plan to use any of the proceeds towards MPLX. As I stated before, we don't see that as in the best interest, but we do see to your point returning that capital and I think you\u2019ve made the point, it will be a large sum of money. It will take some time to effectively do it efficiently etcetera. So that's part of what we're kicking around and a lot of things come into play. Where's the equity going to be when we actually go to do this, what's the best method pros and cons relative to that. So part of the reason that we don't get more detailed at this point, I just use this as the example is when we announce the deal, we were trading in the 30s. Now we're trading around the 40s or so and we'll see where we are in 60 days or whatever the timing turns out to be. Obviously to your point, if you're trying to convince us for undervalued we're 100% aligned with you. We think that there is a lot of opportunity in our equity, but part of the process and looking at the pros and cons is where is that equity going to be by the time we get there and what's the best way to actually go about doing things. The debt side of it I mentioned a little bit, that'll be ongoing conversations with the rating agencies. We do want to protect our investment grade rating. So that's important to us. We want to see how the pandemic continues to play itself out. As you heard Tim mentioned earlier you're feeling good and then all the restrictions and things give you a little bit of a pause, but we're feeling pretty good about that as well. So taken that all into consideration is what we're thinking about and then to your point, it'll be a large return of capital. it will deftly take some time and when we get there, we'll give as much color as we can as to what we think at that time and then there will be some ongoing dialogues to your point. The numbers are good and we're happy that we're in that position. So we think we'll be able to affect the balance sheet adjustment that's really good for us. We think we'll be able affect return of capital that's really good for us. It will take some time and the only thing they we're holding out is the method and the timing because we'll have to wait and see when that time comes. Hopefully that helps. I am trying my best to give you guys as much color as I can, but at the same time trying not to get ahead of where we're going to be when we actually receive the proceeds.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: I just want to say I am glad to know that we on the sell side don\u2019t have to talk to you and your stock being undervalued, that's very comforting on our side. Kidding comment for the day, to kick back into some of the stuff that's been asked and maybe to dig a little deeper on a couple of things first off I think Doug Terreson mentioned on the crack spreads, but as we know at least part of the move in the crack spreads here has been rims related and I know with the separation of Speedway you're retaining the rims inside of the R&M segment. Now I was just curious how you're looking at the impact of the increase in the rims cost and then how we should think about that flowing through the company now that we're going to have I guess essentially already have the separation in terms of how it comes through?\nMike Hennigan: Hey Roger, that's a good question on rims. I'll let Brian take that one.\nBrian Partee: Hey Roger, good morning. Thank you. Yeah so great question. So rims expense is real right, it's cash out the door. We say it's an element of our industry, but no rims costs are also very transparent day in and day out. So we really believe the full consideration is given really across the entire value chain when you look at refiners and some of our producers, blenders, marketers that sit in the value chain and establishing daily prices. So that's not to say that is quote unquote in the crack. I think empirically that's very difficult to point to no different than hydrogen cost or catalyst cost being in the crack, but it's a very transparent element in the value chain that we believe is fully considered in the commercial pension across all the various players that we mentioned. Specific to Speedway, yeah absolutely zero impact. We've always treated Speedway as a third-party customer and our contracts across our entire book really gets full consideration for rims cost and value. So really no impact, no shift in value when you think about between segments as result of the separation. The last point to make on this really is because their entire book, we have extensive terminal network and a pretty robust marketing platform the least of which is into the Speedway book of business. So historically or near historic, the last couple years 70% to 75% of RFS obligations one has been met really through when planning with Dickinson you can add roughly another 10% of that and you can keep doing the math and the Martinez. So we're quickly approaching 100%. So we feel like historically we're positioned well on this issue. We're positioned great today and we're going to be positioned even better into the future.\nRoger Read: Okay. That's helpful thanks. And then I guess is a somewhat unrelated follow up here. I saw on the CapEx for the renewables I think I'm sorry I am going to try to find the chart here, I was flipping around all the different pages, but I think it's 325 or 350 in renewable CapEx in 2021. Is that all Martinez I know you\u2019ve mentioned some other things in renewables. So I was just curious what all is included in 350 and as we think about Martinez, would it be another 350 and 22 just sort of a preliminary way to think about it.\nMike Hennigan: Roger so you're right on that. Most of that is Martinez, that's the way to think about it. Little bit it's dedicated to Dickinson but mostly Martinez and that's the start of what we believe is going to be a multiphase project. So I'll let Ray give you a little bit more color on that to talk a little bit about timing and the phase approach that we have to do. We're pretty excited about the opportunity.\nRay Brooks: Thanks Mike, yeah as Mike said earlier, we are progressing the Martinez renewable fuels project and that is the bulk of the projected renewable spend in 2021. Just to tell you where we are right now, we're in definition engineering. So we're in the third phase of the engineering on the project and we're also working to progress our permit. So were working with the governmental, the regulatory, the NGO, all the stakeholders in our project for aggressive permitting efforts and our focus remains to have the first phase, the first of the hydro traders reconverted to an renewable diesel facility or diesel unit in the second half of 2022 and then we would follow that up with the remaining two hydro traders and 2023 along with the pretreatment system. So it's a stage project and the reason that we're doing the first stage in 2022 is that requires the least amount of the equipment modification to do that. So we're still in the evaluation stage, but just want to give you a little color on the project.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Doug Legate with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDoug Legate: Thank you, Mike. I am so sorry my line dropped when you were halfway through your question, but I'll obviously see the answer in the transcript. So thank you for that and I apologize again everybody. My follow-up question was probably for Ray, and Ray it's actually I guess a follow-up from Mr. Terreson's question earlier on the product side, but I wanted to be a little bit more specific, it seems to us that we're seeing lots of LPG substitution in Asia full of heat related driving not the brent spreads and we're obviously the second-order effects on the gasoline fill. So I am just wondering if you can share any alterations you have specific the issue? Are we seeing gasoline products to support coming from non-transportation sources? I just want to get your color and I'll leave it there, thank you.\nBrian Partee: This is Brian Partee. I think on that brent spread, we have seen some uptick in the demand over in Asia as a result of obviously the cooler temperatures over there and really the entire petrochemical complex. So we've seen some steady demand outside of the US Gulf and even beyond moving over to Asia and really moving into the petrochemical space. So I think it's been supportive to that. I don't know that that's a long-term structural shipment. In the short term we've seen that as a positive.\nDoug Legate: I just confirmation of that if it was in place but with all these instruction guys and appreciate the answers.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nManav Gupta: I wanted to focus on the Gulf Coast opening cost which was like $3.40 down about 31% year-over-year. This is one of the lowest we've in the MPC and definitely well below a number of the FBOs. So what has allowed them to achieve this? I know Mike you're very focused on cost reductions but I am trying to understand what specifically driving the Gulf cost reductions there?\nMike Hennigan: It's a good question. I'll let Ray give you some specifics there.\nRay Brooks: Hey Manav, good morning. Say on the Gulf Coast we have two refineries large refineries Gary Bell and Louisiana and Galveston and Texas and of course Gary Bell has always been a very low cost refinery for us and so the ability to get better there is somewhat limited. The big reductions that we've had in our Gulf Coast structure has been the Galveston Bay. They've made significant improvements in their OpEx and that really showed in the back half of 2020.\nManav Gupta: A quick follow-up here is on your Dickinson facility. Obviously you're spending some money right now to move the product to California, but Canada has already just talking about introducing the two standards in 2022, the location of that facility would allow you to move the products across the border. So is that something you're considering and also if possible at the Dickinson facility also the size of the market in that facility, thank you.\nBrian Partee: Hey Manav. This is Brian Partee. Just to address kind of the market disposition out of Dickinson, of course we're looking for the highest valued markets, the design for Dickinson and the expectation in and around placement is certainly in California and that really has proven to be the most lucrative markets out of the box, but we're having active dialogue with outside of really the West Coast in California and including Canada and we'll continue to chase that high-value placement. But with our position in the Portland area and the Pacific Northwest, we really feel optimally positioned with the wet physical position to be able to move product into Canada and even export as well as into Californian and we also think long-term with the contemplated project that Martin is really complementary to having an robust position out on the West Coast. And the last thing I would say beyond just Canada, there's a lot of different contemplated low carbon fuel standards in the US as well as with a load out on rail, we have really ultimate flexibility only limited by the rail infrastructure in the US which is quite robust. So along with a way of saying, we really feel like we've got a good -- we're in a great position logistically to optimize the placement of the product out of Dickinson.\nManav Gupta: And let's consider pretreatment at Dickinson also.\nMike Hennigan: We have pretreatment options for Dickinson, but that would be at our facility with Beatrice pretreated corn oil. So that is in progress.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: I think the first question I have is for Brady . The average cost in refining and the distribution cost is really impressive. So at this point if it's the bulk of whatever it is you're doing that you're think you already captured it as you say that is limited upside or that I am sure that you continue to drive the cost down, but when that function changed from this point on that we can expect or that this is a pretty good phase and any improvement would be pretty limited. So that's the first question. The second question is probably for Mike and Brian. Brian when we look at your oil  they're far more aggressive in the commercial trading and everything. So when we're looking at Marathon, do you have to raise systems getting paid and also the right person to have for your organization or that's really if only the first staff and you're really going to take some time for you to build it out and where do you see the most opportunities for the improvement in return and earning from that operation and where is the risk and are we going to see that increase the risk?\nMike Hennigan: So Paul I'll start on both in a minute and I'll let Ray and Brain chip in. So on the cost, we've made a significant move as you noted, we're going to challenge ourselves in '21 and beyond to continue to look at each part of our portfolio and where we're spending money whether it's in refining or on the corporate side etcetera. So I don't want to ever say that we're done and at the same time, I do appreciate acknowledging that it was a pretty significant move. We decided when I put out the three initiatives that cost would be a major part of what we were doing in 2020. So that's why it got a lot of attention, but it continues on. It's not something that's over just because we've come to the end of the year whatever. So I'll let Ray comment a little bit more on refining and then on your second question relative to commercial and systems one of the things if you look at in our disclosure on capital is we are spending some money at the corporate level to try and improve ourselves from a digital standpoint. Doug mentioned we were moving in the low carbon future. The business has also become much more strategic from a digital standpoint and our new Chief Digital Officer has a lot of good thoughts that will help our commercial teams advance the ball. So we're going to try and deploy capital in that regard and put ourselves in a much better position from an information standpoint so that you we can act on it better commercially, but I'll let Ray jump in and Brian if he wants to add something there.\nRay Brooks: On the OpEx, I'm prepared to ask that because Mike actually ask that to me all the time, are we done yet? Is there more to do? What I'll tell you is with $1 billion of cost taken out of the system, we took a big bite out of the apple in 2020, but what I'll tell you is that the culture is there and as far as questioning everything we do, whether it's a person replacement, whether it's a project need to do or whatever, there's definitely the mentality and refining the question everything that we do from a cost standpoint. The one thing that I want to emphasize though is the one thing that's not in play is anything that would impact the safety of our environmental performance of our refineries. Mike in his opening comments talked about 2020 being the safest environmental performance that we had. So that always is the key thing, but with our team really is questioning everything we do beyond that.\nPaul Cheng: In September we guys have a restructuring and so 1,000 people from McKinsey and also we people that are gone. So that already into the fourth quarter or we have another breakup in the first quarter that we receive the benefit of the companies.\nMike Hennigan: On that one Paul you'll see some of the benefit occurring in the first quarter. We did the restructuring in the back end of 2020 but you'll actually see the benefit in the first quarter, but before I turn it over to Brian Partee, since we have two Brians, you may have been asking relative to Brian Davis who has just joined us, but Brian Davis is not on the call for us today but I'll let Brian Partee talk a little bit from products and I'll let Rick kick in with a little bit from crude and by our next call, Brian Davis will be with us and will be able to get his insights as well.\nBrian Partee: Just to answer your question on people and systems and commercial opportunity, the short answer is absolutely yes. We've gone through a massive transformation over the last several months realigning on the clean product side of the business, our marketing, supply and trading. our international book as well as into one unified organization. So I think just ordered structure loan will help unleash opportunities. As Mike indicated, we're spending quite a bit of time building out for a massive system to integrate the back office and that's in-flight and underway and really long-term see great potential and we're starting to see the benefits of that already and when we think about commercial performance it's not just revenue, it's looking at the expense and distribution cost as you called out earlier, inventory positions as well. So it's really the full deployment of capital across the value chain, not just on the revenue side, but I am extraordinarily encouraged with we're at and we're really pivoting Paul to be quite honest with you from really a legacy as more of an operational focus with refining over the last decade running full capacity and utilizing physically infrastructure and arms to maximize value to system that we're in today, which is requiring a little different playbook and more commerciality. So were excited to work with the team to bring out to bear and we're seeing benefits already. We'll continue to build on that here over the next year.\nPaul Cheng: Mike I'll just sneak in a really quick question. Should we look at over the next several the CapEx for 2021 would be sort of the base and you're not going to be substantially higher than that?\nMike Hennigan: Yeah Paul on capital we're not given guidance beyond that, but I give you my general philosophy is like I mentioned earlier, we're going to obviously finish the projects that we have in progress. So some of those are going to go in '21 into '22. So that's ongoing. As far as investment in refining, asking Ray to look at ideas that reduce cost and put ourselves in a position for low carbon future. So energy intensity as an example is something that still matters a lot in the energy evolution. Looking at putting ourselves in a position where we check both of those boxes of cost and carbon emission reductions etcetera are going to be top of mind for us. At the same time we're pivoting to investment into renewables and some of the other areas, which will give you some more color as time goes on, but I think that's the general philosophy of it. As far as the absolute spend, we will obviously give guidance as we progress, but I think just in general, I think that's the philosophy that you should be thinking about and it kind of started off with the way Doug asked the question. We do think there's a paradigm shift occurring and our reaction to that is get our cost down be very conscious of the new environment and trying to check off two birds with one stone, put ourselves portfolio wise in a position where our refining assets are in a good spot for many decades to come. That's obviously the goal for us and position ourselves so the products we're making are with the demand in the market. So that's kind of our overall philosophy and we'll continue to challenge what we're doing in that area and we tried to give you a little bit more color with that breakdown of capital. So hopefully that helps people get a sense of what we're thinking philosophy wise.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nBenny Wong: My first question is really on your outlook on the gasoline market. I think over the next couple of years we're going to see almost a million barrels of capacity come offline. Arguably half of that is going to be gasoline and if look at the imports over the last five years, we've been making 5,000 barrels per day. If the math kind of rounds back up to more of a normal environments, could we get back to more of an importing scenario for US? Is that kind of a reasonable way to think about it or how do you guys think about that?\nMike Hennigan: So I'll start off and I'll let other guys jump in. So one of the things Benny that I think everybody is obviously trying to understand is what does the supply-demand look like post-pandemic and we obviously are seeing in the short term the demand reduction supply rationalizations in progress, but how that all plays itself out at the end of the day is still an unknown. We tend to like I said earlier, we look at the banks of the river, we anticipated some challenges on the supply demand coming into the decade as part of the reason why we wanted to focus on cost reductions. But the question of where does the supply-demand you end up after the pandemic after the demand settles to a new normal wherever that's going to be after the rationalization settles out to where that's going to be, I think that's still the question that we're all trying to get our arms around. For us like I keep saying is we\u2019re trying to look at it from the banks of the river standpoint and then we'll assess it as time goes on. I don\u2019t know if you guys have anything to add, they're shaking their head. So I think that's the best we can give you at this point.\nBenny Wong: Thanks Mike, that's very helpful and can you just remind us like if we look at NPC system what's the ability to flex your gasoline deal and how different is that from the US complex? Is it more or less or is relatively alive?\nMike Hennigan: Are you asking Benny liked flex between gasoline and diesel, is that what you're asking?\nBenny Wong: Like how high can you get your yield in terms of gasoline output overall?\nRay Brooks: Benny this is Ray. We typically will have like a 10% swing that we can swing between our gasoline and diesel and we'll do that based on the economics that we see and what I'll tell you in the last year and the pandemic you've seen us do it both ways, you\u2019ve seen this all the way to diesel and challenging ourselves how much more diesel and we come back the other direction.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Benny this is Rick, just one thing I'll add to that to raise comments on yield, a lot of that is driven by econ and a lot of that is driven by the sweet sour spread, the heavy to light spread. So as we've stated many times, we have great flexibility by region as you'll continue to see as we pivot from suites to sours from heavy to lights. We often say one third, two third, but that varies by region and that gives us the flexibility to really turn that yield now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Prashant Rao with Citi Group. You may go ahead.\nPrashant Rao: First one Mike, I wanted to touch back on the leaning into renewables, we've talked about it several times on this call, so wanted to take a big picture view, ultimately how do you think about your ambitions here and would you think about at some point maybe as we go forward holding that out either as a separate earnings stream or a separate segment, I think some of the peers in the space are starting to allude to or are starting to do that and I was helping the analysts and investors to quantify that and sort of gauge where the progress is. So that's my first question any within that too sort of a tag along is on the carbon capture. I know you\u2019ve talked about in carbon emission reduction and energy intensity earlier in this call, I was curious there is opportunities of that in carbon capture on LCFS programs that are fairly attractive. So wanted to sort of ask on that and then I just had a follow-up on the cash flow statement after that thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Prashant on your first one as far as the renewables and segment results, we do have that on the radar screen. At some point we think that may be appropriate for us. As you know, we just started up Dickinson, so we don't even have a full quarter yet. So once we get Dickinson up and running and are generating results and then we have Martinez coming behind that, then we'll have more of a significant discussion point on actual results as opposed to where we are today which is anticipating those results. So I can see that at some point. I would say one of the things that we've worked with Kristina and her team is trying to be very consistent so people can get a good insight into the things that we're doing today, but at some point in the future, I think you could see some changes from us and we'll give you obviously heads up when we're thinking of doing that. Second question was carbon capture and I'll let Ray jump in on this as well is I mean right now in all of the areas of low carbon future or climbing areas, there's a lot of things on the plate. Obviously renewable diesel as you mentioned is kind of at the top of the list because we're executing on that as we speak, but there's a lot of different items that we haven't talked a lot about technologies, different areas that we think we can drive our carbon footprint down and there's different ways whether it's capture or many other areas that we have on the radar screen and we're looking at it. We want to make sure that what we're thinking about is economical for us, going to create value for the shareholders or I guess if we can hit two birds with one stone, that's the best of all world. So I'll let Ray comment specifically on capture.\nRay Brooks: Yeah what I just had on capture is that something that's on the radar screen. We're looking at opportunities there and I'll just emphasize that the capture part is the easier part. The sequestration is a little bit more of the challenging part. So you have that opportunities within hydrogen plants and some of our other operations to do capture and sequestration. I'll just say that it's on the radar screen. We're looking at it, but nothing more incremental there to really say at this point.\nPrashant Rao: Okay. Appreciate all the color and than just a quick follow-up on the financial statements particularly on the cash flow. Working capital is a good tailwind and the quarter sort of a two-parter, one how to think about that here in 1Q as that hold on towards that if what we see a bit a reversal and secondly, within the Speedway portion of discontinued is working cap also assuming it's concluded in that, was that also sort of positive there as well?\nMike Hennigan: Prashant, on working capital as we've said in the past is there's a rule of thumb that as flat price moves we have a essentially a net 20 days exposure to that. So as flat price moves itself up, that's a obviously a source of capital for us in a flat price where it comes down like we saw in the early part of 2020 then it's the use of capital. So the part of that that you're going to see is dependent on where crude price is and product prices are, but as a general rule, we're about a net 20 days exposure there.\nPrashant Rao: Okay. And then fix this and that Speedway number in the discontinued also included working capital as well that's not just to clarify that's not an ex-working capital number correct?\nMike Hennigan: I don\u2019t know if I am understanding your questionnaire there.\nPrashant Rao: The working capital, there will be cash flow from ops from Speedway that was in the discontinued portion. I just wanted to just clarify that that includes any working capital impacts the Speedway and the discontinued portion of cash flows that makes sense. I am just trying to flush out how much, the comments was of working capital impact is still in MPC after Speedway, but I can take the question offline as well Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Okay try better to take it offline.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time that we have for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Kristina Kazarian for closing remarks.\nKristina Kazarian: Sounds great. Thank you, everyone for joining the call today. If you have any follow-ups after the call, our team is available to help out with that. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Ray Brooks",
            "content": "Sure Mike, Neil, I'll just give a little bit more color on the OpEx and this should be fairly consistent with what we talked about during the last earnings call but for OpEx reductions in refining, it wasn't just one thing, it was a multitude of things, but if I had a key on two items, I would say the first is scrutinizing the number of people in our facilities. This is both contractors and employees and just looking at the number of people we have, the number of projects we were working on and so forth and not just cutting people but also consolidating contractor companies and really taking a deficiency look at that. The other thing that we really wanted to do and our procurement supply chain group did a phenomenal job of working with us is making sure that we really leverage to spend across our 2.9 million barrel day of refining system. So looking at all of our contracts, goods and services and making sure that we just had the best terms and best contracts out there, just wanted to jump on what Mike said earlier to is our goal is to make sure that these reductions are structural as possible. Early on in the pandemic, we did some deferral activity with turnarounds, but largely that was to get out of the initial period of March, April, May timeframe but since then, we've caught up on our turnaround work and going into this year we'll do more of the same. So that's just a little bit more color on OpEx. Thanks Mike, yeah as Mike said earlier, we are progressing the Martinez renewable fuels project and that is the bulk of the projected renewable spend in 2021. Just to tell you where we are right now, we're in definition engineering. So we're in the third phase of the engineering on the project and we're also working to progress our permit. So were working with the governmental, the regulatory, the NGO, all the stakeholders in our project for aggressive permitting efforts and our focus remains to have the first phase, the first of the hydro traders reconverted to an renewable diesel facility or diesel unit in the second half of 2022 and then we would follow that up with the remaining two hydro traders and 2023 along with the pretreatment system. So it's a stage project and the reason that we're doing the first stage in 2022 is that requires the least amount of the equipment modification to do that. So we're still in the evaluation stage, but just want to give you a little color on the project. Hey Manav, good morning. Say on the Gulf Coast we have two refineries large refineries Gary Bell and Louisiana and Galveston and Texas and of course Gary Bell has always been a very low cost refinery for us and so the ability to get better there is somewhat limited. The big reductions that we've had in our Gulf Coast structure has been the Galveston Bay. They've made significant improvements in their OpEx and that really showed in the back half of 2020. On the OpEx, I'm prepared to ask that because Mike actually ask that to me all the time, are we done yet? Is there more to do? What I'll tell you is with $1 billion of cost taken out of the system, we took a big bite out of the apple in 2020, but what I'll tell you is that the culture is there and as far as questioning everything we do, whether it's a person replacement, whether it's a project need to do or whatever, there's definitely the mentality and refining the question everything that we do from a cost standpoint. The one thing that I want to emphasize though is the one thing that's not in play is anything that would impact the safety of our environmental performance of our refineries. Mike in his opening comments talked about 2020 being the safest environmental performance that we had. So that always is the key thing, but with our team really is questioning everything we do beyond that. Benny this is Ray.

The sequestration is a little bit more of the challenging part. So you have that opportunities within hydrogen plants and some of our other operations to do capture and sequestration.

            "name": "Brian Partee",
            "content": "Hey Roger, good morning. Thank you. Yeah so great question. So rims expense is real right, it's cash out the door. We say it's an element of our industry, but no rims costs are also very transparent day in and day out. So we really believe the full consideration is given really across the entire value chain when you look at refiners and some of our producers, blenders, marketers that sit in the value chain and establishing daily prices. So that's not to say that is quote unquote in the crack. I think empirically that's very difficult to point to no different than hydrogen cost or catalyst cost being in the crack, but it's a very transparent element in the value chain that we believe is fully considered in the commercial pension across all the various players that we mentioned. Specific to Speedway, yeah absolutely zero impact. We've always treated Speedway as a third-party customer and our contracts across our entire book really gets full consideration for rims cost and value. So really no impact, no shift in value when you think about between segments as result of the separation. The last point to make on this really is because their entire book, we have extensive terminal network and a pretty robust marketing platform the least of which is into the Speedway book of business. So historically or near historic, the last couple years 70% to 75% of RFS obligations one has been met really through when planning with Dickinson you can add roughly another 10% of that and you can keep doing the math and the Martinez. So we're quickly approaching 100%. So we feel like historically we're positioned well on this issue. We're positioned great today and we're going to be positioned even better into the future. This is Brian Partee. I think on that brent spread, we have seen some uptick in the demand over in Asia as a result of obviously the cooler temperatures over there and really the entire petrochemical complex. So we've seen some steady demand outside of the US Gulf and even beyond moving over to Asia and really moving into the petrochemical space. So I think it's been supportive to that. I don't know that that's a long-term structural shipment. In the short term we've seen that as a positive. Hey Manav. This is Brian Partee. Just to address kind of the market disposition out of Dickinson, of course we're looking for the highest valued markets, the design for Dickinson and the expectation in and around placement is certainly in California and that really has proven to be the most lucrative markets out of the box, but we're having active dialogue with outside of really the West Coast in California and including Canada and we'll continue to chase that high-value placement. But with our position in the Portland area and the Pacific Northwest, we really feel optimally positioned with the wet physical position to be able to move product into Canada and even export as well as into Californian and we also think long-term with the contemplated project that Martin is really complementary to having an robust position out on the West Coast. And the last thing I would say beyond just Canada, there's a lot of different contemplated low carbon fuel standards in the US as well as with a load out on rail, we have really ultimate flexibility only limited by the rail infrastructure in the US which is quite robust. So along with a way of saying, we really feel like we've got a good -- we're in a great position logistically to optimize the placement of the product out of Dickinson. Just to answer your question on people and systems and commercial opportunity, the short answer is absolutely yes. We've gone through a massive transformation over the last several months realigning on the clean product side of the business, our marketing, supply and trading. our international book as well as into one unified organization. So I think just ordered structure loan will help unleash opportunities. As Mike indicated, we're spending quite a bit of time building out for a massive system to integrate the back office and that's in-flight and underway and really long-term see great potential and we're starting to see the benefits of that already and when we think about commercial performance it's not just revenue, it's looking at the expense and distribution cost as you called out earlier, inventory positions as well.

Doug, the \u2013 just to reitereate Mike's comments, I mean, we did see a little bit of softness into the back half of the year really after Thanksgiving and really through the end of year, almost a step down with regard to demand and again a lot of it relating to higher case rates. What we'll see, we're seeing a couple of bright spots early in the year, but we're hoping for more. We think this is probably going to take some time. As Mike said, we really need to get the immunization protocol built and as a country accelerate that process to get more and more people comfortable and then ultimately get schools back in session, get people back in the office, get people back on the roads, improve discretionary travel and we think that's going to happen, but that may take some time. And I think we're going to be sort of patient over the course of the year to see that really bear fruit. But definitely better times ahead. We just think it's going to take a little bit of time to really see that. I mean, for the first quarter, I think based on the year-over-year, we're probably going to be 90% of last year's volumes at the retail gasoline level and again, hope to see improvement over the continued -- over the rest of 2021."

            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by welcoming a couple new members to our executive team. First, in January, we announced the appointment of Maryann Mannen as our new CFO. She joins us having spent nearly a decade as a CFO in the energy services and manufacturing sectors. Maryann brings the financial acumen and strategic leadership expertise critical for delivering our business transformation objectives, including strict capital discipline and overall expense management to lower our cost structure. I'm excited for the perspective and business insights she will add to our executive team as we work together to continue strengthening our financial and competitive position. Yesterday, we announced Brian Davis has joined the company in our newly created role of Chief Commercial Officer. Brian has spent over three decades in the industry. His extensive commercial experience, his recent deep background in renewables and alternative energy and a track record of developing and enhancing capabilities is highly complementary to our strategic focus on improving our commercial performance. We look forward to his leadership in developing and implementing a holistic and integrated strategy for MPC's commercial business. These additions will be integral in supporting our strategic initiatives as we progress through 2021 and beyond. Before we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief business update. The unprecedented challenges this year created by the COVID pandemic accelerated the need for us to act swiftly and decisively to change how we conduct our business. The three initiatives highlighted on the slide focus on the aspects of our business within our control, strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance and lowering our cost structure. During the year, we've been faced with many tough decisions, but our team continues to make tangible progress in all three initiatives in ways we believe will drive stronger through cycle earnings and position the company for long-term success. Slide #5 highlights some of our actions taken around our strategic priorities this quarter. First, we continue progressing the sales of Speedway business. During the quarter, we responded to the second request from the FTC and continue to support 7-Eleven in its efforts to secure antitrust clearance. Our interactions with 7-Eleven and our interactions with the FTC have gone well. Thanks Maryann. I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership. Last quarter, we discussed the recent publication of our 2020 Climate Perspectives Report highlighting opportunities in strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. We also discussed our goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and freshwater withdrawal intensities. It's important that we set objectives for the organization to driver our continuous improvement on ESG. Our principles for leading and sustainable energy position us to deliver strong results in the space from lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency in conserving natural resources to increasing renewable fuels production and embracing innovation and deploying advanced technologies. We believe the goals we are setting and our transparent disclosures on how we plan to achieve them place Marathon at the leading edge of our industry. We're seeing recent improvements in our ESG ratings reflecting our hard work in the area. Slide 20 in the appendix highlights to some of these accomplishments. Our approach to sustainability also reflects our commitment to create shared value with our stakeholders, the communities where we operate, our people, our business partners and many others. How we conduct our business enhances the performance we deliver. We look forward to even further expanding our robust engagement with stakeholders and continuing to serve as a valued partner. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Good morning, Doug. Yeah, thanks, it's a good question. Before I answer and I'll let some other members of the team jump in as well. I first want to say, I appreciate your insights over the years and I want to congratulate you specifically on your next steps in your career and thank you for your contributions to our industry. On your question as far as go forward, I think, you mentioned a lot of things that we're looking at. And I guess our term is cautious optimism. For me, specifically, I tend to try not to call the market, but really call the banks of the rivers more. And on the positive side, some of the things that you mentioned that we're clearly seeing and we have that I call it cautious optimism as a result, hopefully, vaccinations will go smooth and hopefully we'll come out of this pandemic in a robust way. So that's kind of the bull view. And then the bear case is, we saw towards the end of last year, cases were going up, restrictions started to kick in a little bit more and we saw what a lot of people anticipated, which was a tough December and into January. Now we're approaching February and will head into the spring. So for us, there's a bull case that says things are moving in the right direction. There's a bear case that says we're not through with this pandemic yet and we got some more fuel to play through before we really see the end of it. But let me - I am going to let Tim comment on gasoline a little bit and Brian can comment on the other projects, just so we can get a sense of what we see in the market today. Tim? Yes. It's a really good question, Doug. So first off, all yes, we do believe that there is a paradigm shift occurring. I like the word energy evolution. So we see that occurring. And I guess, the momentum toward the low-carbon future is obvious. We're focused on how we position ourselves. As you mentioned, I felt that we had to get some things in line relative to cost and looking at our portfolio. But our focus on cost is essential in addition to our lower carbon intensity company to remain competitive for the long-term as these scenarios start to play themselves out. As you mentioned, we have made a commitment in sustainable energy and partly that comes from lowering the carbon intensity of our assets and increasing our exposure in renewable fuels production and we can talk about that a lot more detail today, but we have our Dickinson facility up and running and raise working through the start up there. And then we're still very optimistic about what Martinez can bring to us in that area. And then we're hopeful as technologies advance that we're on top of that and commercially and responsibly put ourselves in a position for the future. So I do agree with your belief that it is a paradigm shift. I do believe there's going to be increasing momentum towards low carbon. Obviously, everybody sees that occurring through the administration's announcements as well as many other companies coming out. And our goal is to stay focused on that change and put Marathon in the best position to be a long-term player in that energy evolution. Thank you, Doug, and again congratulations on your next step. Hey, Neil, thanks for that question. So, obviously, we've been very focused on cost. I stated that throughout 2020 that we needed to make a step change. And in refining, particularly, Ray and his team have taken that and put some really good actions in place. So I'll let him comment in a second. But overall, I think, what you're seeing from us is trying to reset our overall cost structure whether it's in the corporate area or midstream or refining. To your point, we do expect over time as we get past the pandemic for variable cost to come up a little bit. At the same time, we believe that many of the cost reductions that we have in place are structural. They're fixed cost in nature. Obviously, we're hopeful that we have more variable cost and that the demand for our product comes back up. But I think you've seen, over the last couple of quarters, a pretty sustainable step change and that's what we're hoping to show the market. As far as capital Neil, what we're doing there is pivoting to what Doug just referred to as a new paradigm. We have a bunch of projects that are already in progress in refining that we'll continue to finish those out. Examples of that would be like the Star project we have going on down in the Gulf Coast. That's an important project for us. It's still going to take some time to get through, but at the end of the day, we're going to do those projects that we think are in progress and are still valued. We're going to look for projects in refining that lower our costs going forward or change the dynamic we have around this energy evolution and then obviously, pivot more into the renewable space. We've a bunch of things planned for both Dickinson and Martinez. As kind of the first step in this energy evolution, renewables is the hot topic and I think we're in a real good position to put ourselves in a good spot there. So Ray, do you have anything you want to add or... Yeah Neil on the first one the major gating factor is the FTC process with 7-Eleven, so we're watching the process, we're contributing where we can as needed, but that's really a process between 7-Eleven and the FTC. What we know as of today it continues to go well and like I say, I use the word were targeting for the end of Q1 or we're hopeful that the end of Q1 is the right timing, but really the gating item is essentially that process that is not really our processes it's more 7-Eleven in the FTC. So we're supporting it where we can. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we responded to questions, we're supporting it as much as we can. The other activities that we have to get accomplished, which we're very confident we'll get done is the transition services. Obviously it's a major transaction between us and 7-Eleven and there are some services that Marathon is going to transition to 7-Eleven over time. So that's been a lot of the internal work that we've been doing recently. But the bottom line and I know everybody keeps asking about your use of proceeds, we're as anxious as anybody to get to that spot, but at the end of the day, the major gating item is we don't have control of that timing. All we can do is continue to give you the best insight we have and right now we still say we're hopeful its end of first quarter. We're targeting that. We think that's achievable based on what we know. So that our best guidance at this point. On your second issue, as far as the use of proceeds, we've tried as best we can to frame what we believe is the two main pillars that we're going to be targeting, which is getting the balance sheet back to where we want it to be and then return capital to our shareholders as quickly and as efficiently as we can and on the first issue, we've tried to make the statement that our debt situation majorities is there's about $2.5 billion the comes with your essentially minimal friction cost and we'll jump on that one right away. Right today, we have a little over $11 billion of debt. We'll continue to try and evaluate as everybody wants to know where is mid-cycle going to be etcetera, etcetera. We need to work with the agencies so our financial team, Mary Ann and Tom and the treasury team will work with the agencies as to the proper path to bring that debt down to a level that we think is the right spot. In an effort to try and give as much color as we can, we've kind of said to people that hey we don't see it going below $5 billion and that's kind of like our low refining case if you want to call that. So if you say in that regard, we have about a little over $11 billion. We don't see it going below $5 billion. So a number of the put on the piece of paper is around $6 billion depending on how well the recovery is and how quick the recovery is and working with the agencies etcetera. Absent that, we said we're going to return capital, we've talked about what's the best way to do that and the only reason we don't give additional color there is because at least in our mind, we believe right now is end of March is the targeted timeframe. So we have another 60 days to go and we'll continue to evaluate the market and the opportunities and we've been going through this internally with our board, with our advisors, with ourselves and we have a pretty good framework, but we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves in case it takes a little longer than we were expecting. So we do want to return that capital to shareholders. I personally am a believer that refining to a large extent is a return of capital business. We got to position ourselves where we're generating cash and then think about the best way to create value returning it to shareholders and we've talked about all the various ways to do that. It's predominately in a buyback type mode, that's what we're thinking about and then there's pros and cons to the various ways that you can do that and then our commitment is once we get close enough that we know we're there then we'll come on publicly and give a little bit more color as to how we think that'll affect itself, but our goal is as efficiently and as quickly and effectively as we can, we want to try and provide that return of capital. Doug, first of all I don't hate you for asking the question. It's a fair question and I know you've asked a few times about do we plan to use any of the proceeds towards MPLX. As I stated before, we don't see that as in the best interest, but we do see to your point returning that capital and I think you've made the point, it will be a large sum of money. It will take some time to effectively do it efficiently etcetera. So that's part of what we're kicking around and a lot of things come into play. Where's the equity going to be when we actually go to do this, what's the best method pros and cons relative to that. So part of the reason that we don't get more detailed at this point, I just use this as the example is when we announce the deal, we were trading in the 30s. Now we're trading around the 40s or so and we'll see where we are in 60 days or whatever the timing turns out to be. Obviously to your point, if you're trying to convince us for undervalued we're 100% aligned with you. We think that there is a lot of opportunity in our equity, but part of the process and looking at the pros and cons is where is that equity going to be by the time we get there and what's the best way to actually go about doing things. The debt side of it I mentioned a little bit, that'll be ongoing conversations with the rating agencies. We do want to protect our investment grade rating. So that's important to us. We want to see how the pandemic continues to play itself out. As you heard Tim mentioned earlier you're feeling good and then all the restrictions and things give you a little bit of a pause, but we're feeling pretty good about that as well. So taken that all into consideration is what we're thinking about and then to your point, it'll be a large return of capital. it will deftly take some time and when we get there, we'll give as much color as we can as to what we think at that time and then there will be some ongoing dialogues to your point. The numbers are good and we're happy that we're in that position. So we think we'll be able to affect the balance sheet adjustment that's really good for us. We think we'll be able affect return of capital that's really good for us. It will take some time and the only thing they we're holding out is the method and the timing because we'll have to wait and see when that time comes. Hopefully that helps. I am trying my best to give you guys as much color as I can, but at the same time trying not to get ahead of where we're going to be when we actually receive the proceeds. Hey Roger, that's a good question on rims. I'll let Brian take that one. Roger so you're right on that. Most of that is Martinez, that's the way to think about it. Little bit it's dedicated to Dickinson but mostly Martinez and that's the start of what we believe is going to be a multiphase project. So I'll let Ray give you a little bit more color on that to talk a little bit about timing and the phase approach that we have to do. We're pretty excited about the opportunity. You're welcome Doug. It's a good question. I'll let Ray give you some specifics there. We have pretreatment options for Dickinson, but that would be at our facility with Beatrice pretreated corn oil. So that is in progress. So Paul I'll start on both in a minute and I'll let Ray and Brain chip in. So on the cost, we've made a significant move as you noted, we're going to challenge ourselves in '21 and beyond to continue to look at each part of our portfolio and where we're spending money whether it's in refining or on the corporate side etcetera. So I don't want to ever say that we're done and at the same time, I do appreciate acknowledging that it was a pretty significant move. We decided when I put out the three initiatives that cost would be a major part of what we were doing in 2020. So that's why it got a lot of attention, but it continues on. It's not something that's over just because we've come to the end of the year whatever. So I'll let Ray comment a little bit more on refining and then on your second question relative to commercial and systems one of the things if you look at in our disclosure on capital is we are spending some money at the corporate level to try and improve ourselves from a digital standpoint. Doug mentioned we were moving in the low carbon future. The business has also become much more strategic from a digital standpoint and our new Chief Digital Officer has a lot of good thoughts that will help our commercial teams advance the ball. So we're going to try and deploy capital in that regard and put ourselves in a much better position from an information standpoint so that you we can act on it better commercially, but I'll let Ray jump in and Brian if he wants to add something there. On that one Paul you'll see some of the benefit occurring in the first quarter. We did the restructuring in the back end of 2020 but you'll actually see the benefit in the first quarter, but before I turn it over to Brian Partee, since we have two Brians, you may have been asking relative to Brian Davis who has just joined us, but Brian Davis is not on the call for us today but I'll let Brian Partee talk a little bit from products and I'll let Rick kick in with a little bit from crude and by our next call, Brian Davis will be with us and will be able to get his insights as well. Yeah Paul on capital we're not given guidance beyond that, but I give you my general philosophy is like I mentioned earlier, we're going to obviously finish the projects that we have in progress. So some of those are going to go in '21 into '22. So that's ongoing. As far as investment in refining, asking Ray to look at ideas that reduce cost and put ourselves in a position for low carbon future. So energy intensity as an example is something that still matters a lot in the energy evolution. Looking at putting ourselves in a position where we check both of those boxes of cost and carbon emission reductions etcetera are going to be top of mind for us. At the same time we're pivoting to investment into renewables and some of the other areas, which will give you some more color as time goes on, but I think that's the general philosophy of it. As far as the absolute spend, we will obviously give guidance as we progress, but I think just in general, I think that's the philosophy that you should be thinking about and it kind of started off with the way Doug asked the question. We do think there's a paradigm shift occurring and our reaction to that is get our cost down be very conscious of the new environment and trying to check off two birds with one stone, put ourselves portfolio wise in a position where our refining assets are in a good spot for many decades to come. That's obviously the goal for us and position ourselves so the products we're making are with the demand in the market. So that's kind of our overall philosophy and we'll continue to challenge what we're doing in that area and we tried to give you a little bit more color with that breakdown of capital. So hopefully that helps people get a sense of what we're thinking philosophy wise. So I'll start off and I'll let other guys jump in. So one of the things Benny that I think everybody is obviously trying to understand is what does the supply-demand look like post-pandemic and we obviously are seeing in the short term the demand reduction supply rationalizations in progress, but how that all plays itself out at the end of the day is still an unknown. We tend to like I said earlier, we look at the banks of the river, we anticipated some challenges on the supply demand coming into the decade as part of the reason why we wanted to focus on cost reductions. But the question of where does the supply-demand you end up after the pandemic after the demand settles to a new normal wherever that's going to be after the rationalization settles out to where that's going to be, I think that's still the question that we're all trying to get our arms around. For us like I keep saying is we're trying to look at it from the banks of the river standpoint and then we'll assess it as time goes on. I don't know if you guys have anything to add, they're shaking their head. So I think that's the best we can give you at this point. Are you asking Benny liked flex between gasoline and diesel, is that what you're asking? Prashant on your first one as far as the renewables and segment results, we do have that on the radar screen. At some point we think that may be appropriate for us. As you know, we just started up Dickinson, so we don't even have a full quarter yet. So once we get Dickinson up and running and are generating results and then we have Martinez coming behind that, then we'll have more of a significant discussion point on actual results as opposed to where we are today which is anticipating those results. So I can see that at some point. I would say one of the things that we've worked with Kristina and her team is trying to be very consistent so people can get a good insight into the things that we're doing today, but at some point in the future, I think you could see some changes from us and we'll give you obviously heads up when we're thinking of doing that. Second question was carbon capture and I'll let Ray jump in on this as well is I mean right now in all of the areas of low carbon future or climbing areas, there's a lot of things on the plate. Obviously renewable diesel as you mentioned is kind of at the top of the list because we're executing on that as we speak, but there's a lot of different items that we haven't talked a lot about technologies, different areas that we think we can drive our carbon footprint down and there's different ways whether it's capture or many other areas that we have on the radar screen and we're looking at it. We want to make sure that what we're thinking about is economical for us, going to create value for the shareholders or I guess if we can hit two birds with one stone, that's the best of all world. So I'll let Ray comment specifically on capture. Prashant, on working capital as we've said in the past is there's a rule of thumb that as flat price moves we have a essentially a net 20 days exposure to that. So as flat price moves itself up, that's a obviously a source of capital for us in a flat price where it comes down like we saw in the early part of 2020 then it's the use of capital. So the part of that that you're going to see is dependent on where crude price is and product prices are, but as a general rule, we're about a net 20 days exposure there. I don't know if I am understanding your questionnaire there. Okay try better to take it offline."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Don Templin, CFO; and other members of our Executive Team.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina, and thanks for joining our call this morning. Slides 3, highlights our company's three strategic areas of focus in the near-term. Building and executing on these three strategic pillars will enable us to position the company for long-term success and through cycle resiliency. As we continue to navigate the challenges created by COVID-19, for both our company and the industry, we've remained focused on the aspects of our business within our control. This includes, strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance, and lowering our cost structure. On Slide 4, we provide a quick update on actions taken around those three strategic priorities this quarter. First, we're making good progress on the sales of Speedway business and continue to target the first quarter of 2021 to close the transaction. The Speedway and 7-Eleven teams are very focused on completing the activities required to successfully close the transaction. Additionally, our interactions with the FTC have been constructive. We also wanted to provide more color around the use of proceeds from the Speedway sale, since we have continued to receive questions about an MPLX buy in. As you know, we ran a comprehensive midstream review process that began last year, and we announced the results of that review earlier this year. Our conclusion from that process has not changed. We've remained committed to using the sale proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to MPC shareholders, and do not intend to buy an MPLX with cash from the Speedway sale. As it relates to MPLX, however, we continue to position MPLX towards free cash flow after distributions and capital, in order to proceed with unit buybacks which have now been authorized by the MPLX Board. One of our most important priorities as we evaluate the use of proceeds is our commitment to defending an investment grade credit profile. We expect to target in MPC alone debt-to-EBITDA leverage metric of 1 to 1.5 times. Given the significant and stable distributions from MPLX, we don't envision an MPC balance sheet with less than $5 billion of debt on a true cycle basis. As a reminder, we also expect to increase the cash component of our core liquidity position, by an additional $1 billion to offset for the loss of cash flows from Speedway. Within this framework and based on our current assessment, we expect that the remaining proceeds will be targeted for shareholder return. We are evaluating the form and timing and we'll share our plans closer to their transaction close.\nDon Templin: Thanks Mike. MPC's adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion for the third quarter of 2020. In addition to the adjustment for turnaround costs, adjusted EBITDA excludes net pre-tax charges of $525 million recorded in the third quarter, which are summarized on Slide 5. We recorded $348 million of restructuring expense related to the indefinite idling of our Martinez and Gallup facilities, as well as costs associated with our announced workforce reduction plan.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Don. I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership. We recently published our 2020 perspectives on climate related scenarios report, highlights of which can be found on Slide 17 in the appendix. This is the fourth year we have published our TCFD compliant report, which highlights the opportunities and strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. As a result of continued refinements of our ESG perspectives, we want to mention two additional and important initiatives we have established, incremental to our announcement earlier this year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity to 30% below 2014 levels by 2030. First, we've established a 2025 goal to reduce methane emissions intensity from our natural gas business to 50% below 2016 levels. Second, we're focusing on conserving and managing our use of water. Through our efforts in this area, we have reduced our freshwater withdrawal intensity by over 10% since 2015, and we expect to further reduce it by an additional 10% by 2030.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If time permits, we will re prompt for additional questions. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question will come from Doug Legate with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDoug Legate: Well, thank you. Good morning, everybody. Mike, I appreciate the clarity on recent statement on MPLX, however, I wonder if I could ask you to elaborate a little bit on the justification. And just to remind you and I'm sure you know, we have a 15% yield versus MPC at a little under 8%. And obviously the question is over what happens after the election as it awaits for the relative tax advantage are probably going to be something that that you may want to comment on as well. But just a justification as to, why buying an MPLX does not make sense for MPC at this point?\nMike Hennigan: Hey. Good morning, Doug. So I'll give you couple of comments. Number one, we stated continuously that our goals have been to put the balance sheet back in order and return capital MPC shareholders. So, we still believe that that's our first priority here. And as you look at what we've done over the last couple of months, we've enhanced our base case on shareholder return with the change from a spin of Speedway into a sale of Speedway, which I do believe is a win-win for both ourselves and for 7-Eleven. But as we look at the equities, I mean we certainly acknowledge the argument the people have made about, like you said, a 15% yield or so around MPLX. At the same time, we view both equities are very undervalued. Particularly we view the MPC considerably undervalued compared to where we think it should be long-term. And if you dovetail that with our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, we think the best value is to return capital in the form of buying back units in MPC. We believe that the yield at MPLX should improve with our base plans at MPLX, which we noted today that we are going to continue to proceed into a free cash flow after distributions in capital at MPLX, and put ourselves in a position to start buying back MPLX's units with MPLX cash flow, and then we can target MPC cash at MPC shareholders in a form of buybacks. We also mentioned on the call that we still have a little bit of time before we get to closing, which we're still anticipating first quarter. But we're going to continue to look at, we've said form and timing of those buybacks is something we're continuing to evaluate, continuing to talk to our Board about. But at the end of the day, we think it's a much better value proposition for MPC shareholders, and we believe it's the right use of proceeds.\nDoug Legate: Okay. I appreciate the answer. We can probably debate that, but I'm sure you continue to get questions on it. My follow-up, if I may, is on the portfolio. It looks like your operating cost reductions or at least the headcount reductions you mentioned are starting to show up in the numbers. So just wondered, if you can give us an update on how you see any specifics as to what you see are the next steps for the portfolio? I know you've been somewhat reluctant to give any specifics, but as the process is going on, I just wondered if you can offer any more clarity, and I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Thanks, Doug. A couple of comments, on the portfolio, obviously, the most important things we've been going we've been very public about. I mentioned Speedway sale is a win-win. I think at the end of the day, 7-Eleven is getting a quality team and a group of assets that enhance their portfolio. At the same time, MPC is monetizing the retail margin by keeping the fuel supply chain, so I think that's an important portfolio step for us. We've also talked about moving into the renewable space. We can give a little more color on that as well, but we're starting up a facility up in North Dakota. We're continuing plans at Martinez. So, those are the major portfolio discussions that we have going in our public about at this time. I will tell you that, we continue to look at our portfolio and our goal is to make sure that we have a competitive set of assets that can manage through any type of tough environments, like we're experiencing today. The other thing that hopefully you are going to continue to see on a quarter-to-quarter basis, is our cost cutting efforts and time to change the cost structure of the company. One of my styles is not to get ahead of ourselves, because we continue to work at it. We're continuing internally to challenge ourselves in different areas. So the best way to stay apprised of that effort is to look at our quarterly results, as we continue to report out each quarter. And I think you'll see a sense of concentration on this area. And you'll be able to really see what we're delivering as far as costs restructuring of the company.\nDoug Legate: Mike, I appreciate again the full answer, but just for clarification. There's been speculation in the market that you were looking to exit one of your assets on the Gulf Coast. Can you address that directly, and I will leave it there? Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Doug, again, there's always a lot of rumors. We're not expecting to exit our assets on the Gulf Coast, we are expecting to evaluate all of our assets. And we're looking at ways that we can reduce our cost structure in the Gulf Coast, on the West Coast and in the midcontinent. But right now, I think, the important thing for you to think about is, look at the results that we're delivering, try and get a good assessment of where you see the costs, I'll let Don comment on that specifically. And then continue to get updates from us on a quarterly basis, and we'll try and give you as much color as we can as to how that occurred. One of the tough things in our business is, we did implement a workforce reduction. As I said, in my prepared remarks, that's a very difficult decision for us, but we thought it was necessary for the long-term viability of the Corporation.\nDon Templin: Yes. Doug, I might add in Mike's comments, he talked about at the end of the first quarter, when we had our earnings call, we told you all that we were targeting two things around reducing capital and reducing our expenses. And we'd indicated that we were planning to reduce our capital by about $1.4 billion. I think we're trending probably $100 million to $200 million better than that right now. Most of that would be on the R&M side of the business, but we're also seeing some improvement on the MPLX side of the business. With respect to the - and you'll recall that that $1.4 billion of reductions was split sort of evenly $700 million for MPLX, $700 million for the rest of them MPC. With respect to the cost reductions that we were targeting $950 million that was $750 million for MPC, excluding MPLX, and $200 million for MPLX. MPLX is doing well against their target and we'll do better than they were targeting. And I think where we've really seen the difference and the improvement and the effort is around our R&M part of the business, particularly the refining part of the business. So I mentioned that our operating costs have been averaging about $1.27 billion a quarter since we made that announcement, that's about $350 million better than the first quarter of 2019. So if you just extrapolated that sort of $350 million a quarter, that gets you to - and our guidance for the fourth quarter is right in that same range, that would get you to about $1.50 billion against what was a target of $750 million. So, we feel really good about our ability to deliver that cost reduction.\nDoug Legate: Great. Thanks for the full answers, fellows. I appreciate it.\nDon Templin: You're welcome, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for doing this, this morning. I guess just going back to the Speedway transaction, what are the hurdles and milestones we should be watching in terms of closure of the transaction? It does seem like you guys believe they'll be on track for Q1. And then as you think about the allocation of the cash to the extent that you will be executing it fill a large buyback program. Just how do you think about doing it efficiently and ensuring that you're able to reduce as much of the share count as possible? So that's more of a tactical question. That's my first question.\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, Neil. So on your first part, I mean, the process is going along as expected. We did receive a second request from the FTC. And we were expecting that, 7-Eleven was expecting that. So the teams are working through the questions that have come out of that review. Overall, I would say, in general, it just takes time to get through that process. And as a result of that, that's why we've targeted this first quarter timing. We don't see anything at this moment that takes us off of that timing. Obviously, if we did, we would communicate that. But right now the process is going I'd say as expected and the situation is such that we have not seen any surprises. Our anticipation of what the FTC would ask is very consistent with what 7-Eleven was thinking as well. So overall, I'd say the process is on target. And our expectation is still for a first quarter close. I just forgot - what was the second question, I forget.\nDon Templin: It was around the process for returning shares, or share repurchase or a capital return, if you will.\nMike Hennigan: Okay. Yes. And on that, Neil, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that, we've tried to put some clarity on use of proceeds. As Doug mentioned, there was a lot of questions around MPLX buy in. And we wanted to definitively state that our goal is not to buy an MPLX with this cash, but to return to shareholders, as well as get the balance sheet in order. We're not ones, it's not in our DNA to predict what's the mid cycle going to be. But we thought, we'd give a little bit more clarity by some of our scenario planning, which basically said that we don't see the debt on the balance sheet at MPC going below $5 billion. I mean, hopefully, that gives a little more clarity as we do our scenario planning. We want to have an appropriate amount of leverage at MPC. And so we thought that that was a good disclosure for the market to understand how we're thinking about it. As far as the return, we're still in that process. We have several more months to go before we reach the closure point. Myself, Don, the Board, the whole team is evaluating with our advisors. And I think you hit it on the head, what's the most efficient way for us to return that capital? And that's exactly what we have been debating. And as you know, there's a lot of different ways that you can return that capital, there are pros and cons to each of those. And it's our expectation that as we get closer to the close, we'll give a little bit more clarity there. But that's where we are in the process at this point.\nNeil Mehta: No, that's very clear, Mike and Don. And the follow-up is, there's been a lots happening on the West Coast. I just want your perspective on the medium to long-term outlook for the refining market out there, as you weigh a couple of different factors, renewable diesel, changes in efficiency standards, but on the positive side, asset closures. How do you think about the different moving pieces on the West Coast?\nMike Hennigan: Hey, Neil, I'll start and Don can jump in if he likes or Ray. One of the things that I think is occurring with COVID is it's forcing rationalization in this industry, and you don't want a faster pace that would normally be occurring in a downward cycle. So, one of the things that I think we're seeing across the board, certainly for Marathon, we've announced that we are changing the configuration at Martinez, that's our goal at this point to move it to renewable diesel as a result of its cost structure. And we've also put Gallup in a shutdown mode. So, our view is the tough challenge, whether it's the West Coast, or whether it's global worldwide, the industry is under a lot of stress right now. And the way cyclical industries get out of that stress is rationalization. And our expectation is that COVID is just accelerating that. Overall, Neil my motto is, we're going to worry about the things we can control and keep an eye on the things that we don't control. The things we do control out on the West Coast specifically is moving expeditiously the change, what we believe was a high cost asset that would not survive in the long-term, processing hydrocarbons and moving that to renewable diesel. And we have an update on that in our prepared remarks, like I said, or Ray can go into a little bit more. But that's something that we do control. So, we're moving forward with that study. At the same time, we are continuing to evaluate costs back on the West Coast, as well as the rest of the company. Don just gave you, hopefully, a lot more color on what we're doing in that area. And then again, I'll just reiterate that our style will be such that every quarter we'll try and give you an update on these major initiatives, and tell you how we're progressing with Martinez, tell you how we're progressing with our cost initiative, and any changes to the portfolio we'll be happy to update as time goes by.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, guys.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome, Neil.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess really to dive into last parts of kind of your answer to Neil's question. As we think about rationalization in an industry that's absolutely struggling here. What thoughts do you have for - I don't know, if it's magnitude, if it's timing, it's a combination of the two of what else the industry may do here? I mean, Marathon is obviously taking a big first step on your own kind of what are the expectations for the industry, as we look into, I guess, Q1 and Q2 of next year for most of the big decisions to occur between now and yearend as well?\nMike Hennigan: Roger, I think, you pointed out and like you said we addressed that a little bit on Neil's question is, at the end of the day, one of the things that the industry is struggling with is, the loss of demand that's occurred and been accelerated as a result of COVID. That demand has recovered quite a bit, but it's not back to the levels that we've seen previous to the virus. Overall, gasoline and diesel are obviously doing much better than jet fuel. But at the end of the day, this is a commodity business, it's a margin business. And to your very point, the way that the industry gets itself back into a good position is twofold, is one is demand recovers to the point of post-Coronavirus, whenever that occurs, hopefully vaccines are progressing, as we've been reading about. And I'm sure you guys have been reading about, so the expectation for that to occur sooner is great news. And that'll help on the demand side. And then on the supply side, it's purely a matter of math and marginal assets, we'll have to rationalize. If you look at some of the data, even outside the U.S. that rationalization is occurring and the bottom line is in a new world, wherever that may be, from a demand standpoint, or whatever, marginal assets will not be able to sustain themselves long-term. And the main reason that one of our key short-term initiatives is get our cost structure in a position that can manage these types of dips in commodity markets. So, one of our important goals is to make sure that we continue to progress, our cost structure changes, and I think you'll continue to see that quarter after quarter as we work on these initiatives, and position ourselves so that we're not the marginal assets. To Neil's point, whether it's West Coast-related or U.S.-related or globally-related, at the end of the day rationalization will occur, is occurring, will continue to occur and hopefully, demand comes back and the industry gets itself back on a better footing.\nRoger Read: Okay. Great, thanks. And then a question for you, Don, kind of, I guess we call them somewhat non-operating cash flow questions. But working capital had a big move here in Q3, what are your thoughts as we look into the next quarter? And then on the income tax receivable side, that was discussed on the last call. I was just curious where that number kind of shakes out? And if there's any change in the expectation of cash recovery, Q2 of next year on that front?\nDon Templin: Yes. So let me take sort of your second question first, Roger, in terms of a tax refund. So, we anticipate that we will have a relatively significant NOL this year, and we will have the ability to carry that back into prior years. We have not yet published our 10-Q, but I'll kind of give you sort of a preview in the 10-Q, you'll see in the cash flow statement that there's an increase in tax receivables of about a $1 billion. So right now, that will be the - what we will be having as a receivable sitting on our balance sheet related to our forecast right now of that sort of refund. Obviously, lots of things can happen between now and the end of the year. If there's a change in administration or we see a change in tax law, between now and the end of the year, there's probably some knobs that we may want to or levers that we may want to manage to make sure that we're optimizing our tax situation in 2020, and in 2021. But right now, I would say that numbers in sort of the $1 billion-ish range that will be on the balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. The other thing in terms of timing, I think realistically, the timing is probably third quarter, not second quarter. And the reason I say that is, we'll need to get everything closed, our tax returns filed, and then wait for the refund, and I just don't know how fast that will happen. But I think that it'll take some period of time into 2021 to get the tax return completed, all the things that we have to do. So, hopefully that's helpful from that perspective. And then I think you're right, in terms of the cash flow statement for the quarter, we had a fairly large working capital impact. And we highlighted one piece of that working capital impact that related to accruals that we made with respect to the restructurings that we were doing. I guess, the other piece that's in the working capital adjustment, so in the $868 million, you'll recall that we had a $256 million charge for LIFO liquidations. So that $256 million charge is showing up as a negative, if you will, in cash flow - cash flow from operations. And then the reduction in the inventory is showing up as a source of cash in the cash flow statement from working capital. So, there's a bit of - our cash flow statement probably is a little bit has some unusual items in it this quarter because of some of the charges that we've recorded. As we think forward, I mean, we were pleased with where we ended up with cash, as the quarter end was at $716 million. And if you think about sort of the change from the second quarter about $300 million change, and $200 million of that change was really because we paid down some debt at MPLX. So I think a pretty strong cash quarter for us, given the situation and the environment in which we're operating.\nRoger Read: Definitely. Thanks. Just to clarify your comment on the tax receivable. The $1 billion change, was it like year-to-date? Or is that the Q2 to Q3 we should think about? And I appreciate the Q will come out later, but I'd just\u2026\nDon Templin: That's year-to-date, Roger. So that will be in the cash flow statement. The cash flow statement has not done for a quarter, the cash flow statement has done for a year-to-date period. So that $1 billion is in the year-to-date number.\nRoger Read: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: Hey, guys. Congrats on getting the Dickinson Refinery converted. I'm just trying to understand, can you help us understand, when you create the product in North Dakota, the logistics and the marketing involved and trying to move it to the end market where you can get the highest value, which in this case right now would be California. At some point, we hope Canada puts a similar program so the market moves closer to you. But right now, how would you get your 12,000 barrels a day from North Dakota all the way to California?\nBrian Partee: Yes, Manav, this is Brian Partee. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So we've got the distribution channel all set up. We're working through the production and startup. It is a complex distribution network as you'd expect, and it's new too. So we've got transit time, so we'll be loading out the  rail. So a lot of flexibility as we hit the rail in North Dakota, and then we'll be moving it to the Pacific Northwest, where we'll be able to get to the water from there. So, both from rail domestically, as well as into Canada, we have a lot of flexibility to move, and then we'll be on the water out in the West Coast to hit as you noted, California, and frankly, wherever else we see the demand. From a marketing standpoint, as is typical, we've got a full portfolio to optimize how we sell into the market, both bulk sales. We've got committed contract sales as well as open rack sales. So we're excited to see the production come on. We're very optimistic placing into the market has not been a problem. So we've got things lined up and ready to go. In startup, though, we think probably mid to late December, so we've got oil in. Cash in is really important, obviously on the other end of thing. So we'll probably be mid to late December on that, and then really set up well for Q1 of 2021 to be rolling with the full production and full distribution.\nManav Gupta: Thanks. And I have a quick follow-up. You filed your permit for the Martinez conversion, I think October 1. You have listed various feedstocks in there. Can you help us understand the way the breakup would work between lower carbon intensity feedstocks versus higher carbon intensity feedstocks? And how do you plan to get the lower carbon intensity feedstocks to the Martinez Refinery? Thank you.\nRay Brooks: Hey, Manav, this is Ray Brooks. Thanks for the question. Our first goal has always been to complete the construction of the facility started up, and then optimize the refinery. And when I say optimize, optimize the carbon intensity of the operation, and then also the feedstock slate. And so I'm really happy to report that the plant completed construction about three weeks early, and is currently in startup as Mike said to earlier. I'm also happy that we were able to go from shovel to start up in under two years. Doing this while navigating through two North Dakota winters and a pandemic, and I just want to state that I'm really, really proud of the team for everything that they've accomplished. I was just out at the site, and it's really impressive facility, you might think that a 12,000 barrel day plant is small, but it's now the second largest renewable diesel plant in the United States. And getting to your question on the feed slate, the initial feed slate is 10,000 barrels a day of soybean oil, 2,000 barrels a day of corn oil. And we'll work diligently to make sure that we optimize that within any capabilities that we have. But I just want to say that we're really excited about the Dickinson plant being an early mover in the renewable diesel space.\nManav Gupta: Sorry, my question was more on the Martinez feedstock side. But that wasn't clear. How do you plan to run Martinez as far as lower CI versus higher CI feedstocks are concerned?\nRay Brooks: Pivoting to Martinez and I'll just talk a little bit about Martinez to give you a little bit more information you're looking for. But we're excited about Martinez from the standpoint that we have a facility with three hydro processing units, two hydrogen plants and an extensive infrastructure that gives us a very capital efficient project. And it gives us a capital efficient project from the standpoint that we will be able to run a multitude of feedstocks, whether it's soy, whether it's corn, whether it's tallow, whether it's use cooking oil. We are designing that flexibility into the program, into the project. And we're working diligently right now talking to feedstock suppliers as far as potential partners with us from the feedstock standpoint on that. The Martinez project, a little bit farther out there, while Dickinson is currently in operation. Martinez, we're working hard to get to that point. But now what we've done in the last quarter, we've submitted applications for our air permit. We've also submitted the initial study for the environmental impact report. We've completed our feasibility engineering and moved into detailed engineering. And we've also met with key regulatory, governmental and NGO stakeholders. So, we're continuing to move that along. And then part of moving that along will also be on the feedstock supply. So, we're not ready to tell you exactly what we're going to do on that, just tell you that we're working on it.\nManav Gupta: No, this is very helpful. Thank you so much, guys.\nDon Templin: Hey, Manav, this is Don. One other just sort of point to raise, you'd asked about sort of the cost to move Dickinson product to the West Coast. So, you probably saw in our outlook information that distribution costs went up slightly. And that sort of slight change in distribution costs is reflective of the distribution costs related to getting the Dickinson product to the West Coast.\nManav Gupta: Thank you. Thank you, guys.\nDon Templin: You're welcome, Manav.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBenny Wong: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is really around how you think about the midstream business? I think, there's expectations for lower E&P and upstream activity going forward, potentially more moderated volumes domestically. How do you guys see the environment changing? And how does that translate into how you, see an approach that part of the business?\nMike Hennigan: Hey, Benny, this is Mike. So, couple things. Number one, I'll say prior to COVID, the number one question we were getting asked was, the gas portion of MPLX in the midstream business. And since COVID, I mean, obviously, a lot of things have changed. And we're looking at a gas strip that has a three in front of it now compared to what was some pretty tough natural gas prices. So, our view longer-term, and we've kind of stated this, so I'm going to just repeat myself a little bit is, MPLX is an important part of MPCs structure. We really rely on that stable dividend that comes out or distribution that comes out of MPLX. It's an important part of our structure. At the same time, we do believe the midstream business is going to continue to grow. To you point, albeit maybe at a different pace, if the E&P business and goes to a little slower mode. But being a natural gas we think is an important thing right now, as the market continues to evolve in the energy landscape, natural gas in our view is going to continue to be an important part of growth. At the same time, as I mentioned earlier, we do believe we'll get back to normal once we get through the virus and have a vaccine and get demand back in our LMS business as well. We have a couple projects in play right now that will bring additional earnings. So, the forward growth structure there may be a little slower than originally anticipated, as a result of the E&P change. But at the end of the day, we think it's going to be a very strong contributor and continue to have growth that will continue to increase earnings, as far as even at MPLX, which continues to add value for both MPLX and MPC. At the end of the day, I'd tell you one of the things that I think has been misunderstood a little bit is, the stability of the earnings at MPLX. And hopefully, this quarter it gets to show how much we think how strong that earnings profile is, as well as it being supplemented by cost reductions that we've talked about as well.\nBenny Wong: Thanks, Mike. That's very clear and helpful. My follow-up might be for Don, but obviously, could be open for anybody. I appreciate the information around the recent changes in reporting. Just going forward, just curious how you think about how you can present the company, as your renewable diesel business grows it doesn't make sense at some point breaking that out, like some of your peers? And for your refining, marketing disclosures, could some of the marketing and direct dealer business eventually broken out so your refining business can be more comparable to peers? So, essentially, just curious how you think about how you can present your performance or your business and make it easier for investors to benchmark you guys? Thanks.\nDon Templin: Benny, this is Don. Thanks for that question. So, I think one of the things that we've been very focused on over let's say the last four quarters or so, with feedback from you all and from our investors, is that there was sort of a request or a suggestion that will be helpful, if we stabilized the way we were reporting the information to you all, so that it was consistent quarter-to-quarter without a lot of changes, so that you could get to a point where your models could get tightened up refined, whatever the right terminology is. So, I think we've gotten to that point. This quarter was obviously a quarter with lots of moving pieces, including the discontinued operations. And we didn't think that it was an appropriate quarter to introduce a whole bunch of other changes. Mike's talked about how we're restructuring the company, how we're optimizing it, there's a lot of changes that are still occurring. And I guess it would be our view, my view that the best time to roll out sort of a new way of thinking about how the company presents its information and operates is when we get through some of that transition, so that we can do at one time. We can recast all the prior periods. We can provide you all the data that you need to update your models timely, and avoid any sort of confusion or situations where the information isn't as clear. So yes, we are thinking about how the company should look and how we should be presenting that information. This just wasn't the right time to do that. But we will be looking for the right time to think about how we present that information. And we do welcome feedback from you all and from the investors on what's the right way to or what's helpful in terms of information that we can provide that allows you to understand our business better.\nBenny Wong: Great. Thanks, Don.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Couple of questions. The first one is probably for Don. In the third quarter, you have very good cost performance and is actually much better than your guidance. And you actually on the absolute dollar term in the refining, and you have a higher throughput. So Don, the question is, is that being just conservative in your guidance or that the performance has ended up better than what you think? And if that's the case, what's driving that better performance? Is it some one-off, or just ? And also that in California, you're $10.50 per unit on the operating costs. If those still have the personnel cost on McKinsey  or that those 0is already out? That's the first question. The second question is for Mike, for the 30% GHG emission intensity reduction by 2030, is that going to be sufficient? A lot of your larger customers, I think they are targeting by 2035 going to be net carbon zero at least in group one and two. So, is that something that you think is applicable to you? And if not, why not? Thank you.\nDon Templin: So Paul, let me try to, I think dissect the question or questions that you asked around our performance. So, the first one was, our operating costs have - the team has been performing very well, I mean, very much of a focus area for us. And we're very pleased with the progress that we're making there. So, I think that on a per barrel basis, we probably not only were the absolute costs, lower than we were projecting them to be. But our throughputs were slightly higher. And you have to remember, that guidance was provided at the end of the second quarter, and there was still a lot of uncertainty around what was happening with COVID and what the numbers would be. We've I think, stabilized a little bit in terms of the utilization rates. And so our guidance that we're giving for the fourth quarter, is pretty consistent with the actual that we incurred in the third quarter. And we have a lot of confidence sort of in providing that information. I think you asked about the West Coast and the costs on the West Coast. So, in our operating costs for the West Coast, there are still some continuing costs related to the Martinez Refinery and the idling there. And so, those are obviously putting sort of pressure, if you will, on the per barrel, and there's no equivalent operations at Martinez. So that would have some upward pressure on the per barrel cost. And then I think you were interested in maybe capture rate and sort of how the capture rate was significantly higher than we've historically guided to. So, I think most people model to a 90% capture rate. I think one of the things that happens is when your margins are thin, small variations can cause the capture rate to either be very high or very low. So this quarter, a couple of the factors that impacted the capture rate, I think, for purposes of modeling going forward, I would still be focused on in a normal world, a 90% capture rate, I would then think that I would want to add something for direct dealers, so let's just say, $100 million a quarter or in that range. And then the other things, I think, move about sort of quarter-to-quarter. So, hopefully, that's helpful. But I think part of what made the capture rate look as strong as it was this quarter, was the margins were very thin.\nPaul Cheng: Don. Can I just follow-up on the West Coast? What will be a reasonable target on your OpEx, or maybe this is for Ray, say in 2021 or 2022 once that you're restructuring and everything is in?\nRay Brooks: Yes. I think it's a little premature. We want to give that guidance. We know everybody wants that guidance, Paul, we gave you fourth quarter of what we expect the West Coast to do. But we're going to start tracking and providing color around what I would say is the costs to run or that the incremental costs at Martinez, that we're incurring on a quarterly basis, so that you can see that. And obviously, as we trend to a renewable diesel facility, there's going to be some period of time where we're incurring costs, but we're not incurring or not delivering any sort of throughput through that refinery. But we will be doing that kind of guidance and providing that outlook information sort of on a quarterly basis as we move into 2021.\nMike Hennigan: And, Paul, this is Mike. On your question on the greenhouse gas emissions intensity target, and whether it's enough, I think a couple points I wanted to point out. First off, we think it's more important to have kind of a mid-range goal instead of just a 2050 goal. But it's important to note that the background for our goal there is, so our goal of 30% reduction by 2030 from 2014 levels represents about a 2% reduction per year in carbon intensity, which is the slope necessary to meet the desired reductions, or aspirations of the Paris agreement by 2050. So, in order to kind of stay on track to that, we set a goal of 2030 that we believe kind of aligns with that longer-term 2040 to 2050 goal. And as time progresses, we will amend the target on a periodic basis to ensure we remain in line with those longer-term aspirations. But we thought it was more important to kind of show the slope and put a target out there that was more near in, so it was more achievable rather than so far out, that it doesn't - it gets a gets a little bit discounted. The other thing I do want to mention, Paul, aside from the greenhouse gas emissions intensity, I do want to reiterate, something we said in our prepared remarks is that we have stated, 2025 goal to reduce methane emissions intensity. And I think that's a significant ESG move on our part, as well as setting a goal on freshwater withdrawal intensity. Those are two other important areas, where we believe that we can make progress in this area and continue our commitment in the ESG area.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citi Group. Your line is open.\nPrashant Rao: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. My first one is really on the operating costs continued progress there, and now that you're talking about exceeding the $950 million in OpEx reduction savings. So, just wanted to circle back to that to get a little bit of clarity. How should we think about this kind of on a carry forward basis? I know, Mike, we had discussed in the spring, sort of the some of this is volume related and some of this is sort of just flat cost reduction that carries forward into future years. So, I just wanted to get an update on how we should think about flat and the sort of $950 million plus now? And then also the workforce reduction initiative, that restructuring, I wanted to get a sense of conceptually, is that kind of apart from the numbers that we were targeting? I know you were targeting earlier in the year. It sounds like it was but I just wanted to sort of confirm that, that sort of that really is the gap that the excess over the $900 million plus that we were talking about maybe six months ago? So, that's my first question and the follow-up on commercial ops. Thanks.\nDon Templin: Yes, Prashant. This is Don. So, with respect to the guidance that we gave at the end of the first quarter, the $950 million, that at the time did not envision, that we would - I guess we'd not embarked upon the workforce reduction plan that we just initiated and implemented. So, some of those costs would have been variable costs from operating in an environment where we anticipated that utilization rates would be lower than historical. What I can say and one of the things that we have been able to deliver, I mentioned on the refining side, the whole reduction for R&M or onsite for MPC, excluding MPLX was $750 million for the year 2020. And based upon what we've achieved and what we're guiding, we're probably closer to $1.50 billion or maybe slightly higher than that on an MPC, excluding MPLX basis. So, what that means is that, yes, there's still some variable costs that would have been, might go up as we ramp up operations into 2021. But a lot of the change that we've seen so far is around fixed costs. And so that gives us great confidence going forward. With respect to the workforce reduction, so that was more than 2,000 of our employees were impacted by those actions. Some of those were focused at the Martinez Refinery and the Gallup refinery, but a lot of those were also focused across the rest of the operation. So, you should start seeing some of those costs being embedded in our future projections. And I think, several of those costs, you'll see when we give our first quarter 2021 guidance, you'll be able to see, I think, a meaningful piece of that in the guidance that we give in 2021, but we've not moved that far forward yet.\nPrashant Rao: Okay. That's very helpful color. Thanks, Don. And then just a quick follow-up on to commercial operations and the improvement there. And it's hard to see in an environment like this and the numbers, so I was wondering if maybe Mike or Don you could talk about this for qualitatively, perhaps or point us to where you're seeing that improvement on a Q-on-Q basis, it looks like in your results especially that are held up, as well as not better than some of your peers? So just curious if you could talk about maybe some of the initiatives there that might be helping to bully those results in this tough macro, whether it be on the crude purchasing and logistics side or on the product placement side? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Hey, Prashant. This is Mike. I'll turn it over to Brian and Rick to give a comment. Although, I just want to remind you that in the commercial area, that's probably the toughest area for us to give disclosures, just because of the competitive nature to it, but I'll let the guys give a comment if they like.\nBrian Partee: Yes, thanks Mike. Prashant, good morning. This is Brian Partee. So great question, and I appreciate the recognition that we're in kind of unique environment here to optimize commercially. But just a couple of high-level comments and things to think about where we're focused. I mean, the first one is really around alignment, and that alignment being with people. So we did a pretty heavy restructuring, I have responsibility for all the clean products value chain. So aligning our marketing folks, our supply folks and our training folks into one unified team that are focused geographically, we think is a very positive step, will allow us to operate more efficiently and effectively going forward. And frankly, with the right people in the right space. The second part of focus really here in the short-term is around inventory levels. So we're operating in a different demand environment. So two things we're looking at there. One is, inventory levels and opportunities around inventory reductions, and then related distribution costs. So as Mike stated we're really focused on things that we can control. And those are two things we feel in the short to medium-term are really under our control. And the last part I'll mention before handing it back over to Rick is on the export side. So exports, we believe are foundational and fundamental to helping the business in North America clear, and we're really focused there, developing a broader long-term strategy around how to hit markets outside of the U.S., and utilize our full both production capacity as well as our logistical capacity, primarily along the Gulf Coast, but also on the West Coast as well.\nRick Hessling: Yes, Prashant. This is Rick, thank you for the question. Also, on the crude side from a distribution standpoint, we're certainly going towards more of a just-in time asset model, reducing our distribution costs, that's becoming readily apparent in our results. And in addition to that, when you look at crude avails, we've significantly shifted to light suite. You'll see that in our run rate here in the third quarter, so the adaptability the optionality the switch significantly to light suit runs throughout our operating area has been significant. And then as we look forward, we're looking at medium sours. We've come off a very, very disruptive storm season. And we're starting to see some signs of medium sours getting back to normal. And then we're seeing a little bit of a glimmer of hope from the Canadian side, when you look at the mandate that's been lifted. We're entering the diluent blending season, which will swell the pool. So we're optimistic on a few of the alternative grades, especially that we run in our midcontinent system.\nOperator: Thank you.\nKristina Kazarian: Operator, I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Excellent. Thank you. Our last question then will come from Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Gresh: Hey, good morning. My first question would be just around capital spending, obviously, on track or doing well on the reductions there. But as you look at, say, 2021, or more of a longer-term view on capital spending, curious how you think about that both for total company or just some kind of breakdown amongst the different business lines?\nDon Templin: Yes, Phil, I mean, as I mentioned, and Mike mentioned in the early comments, we're very, very focused on managing capital right now. As it relates to 2021, we've not gotten to the position where we're providing that guidance. We'll get our budget approved later in the year and we'll provide that guidance when we get to our yearend earnings call. But what I can say is that, particularly from the R&M side of the business, we are investing or continuing the investment in projects that are ongoing or that we're completing. And we are very focused on eliminating, I'll call it sort of discretionary spending unless it is in sort of promoting our cost reduction initiatives. So, there was a time probably where our growth spending on the R&M side of the world was more about, I'll call it molecule management, and trying to take sort of, take what we're producing and upgrade what we're producing. I think right now, given the environment we're in, a lot of what we're focused on, on the discretionary spending is on allowing us to be able to manage in a very competitive, low margin environment. So, with those parameters, I think that's what we're doing on the MPC side. On the MPLX side, I mean, the same kind of discipline there. Mike talked about the fact that we feel very good about being positioned in a place where the cash flow from MPLX will cover not only distributions and CapEx, but will have availability then to have that excess cash to deploy to repurchasing units. So very, very focused. Discretionary capital needs to meet a very, very high hurdle, and it needs to be really focused on the initiatives that, Mike has laid out, which is, improving our competitive performance, or reducing our cost structure.\nMike Hennigan: Phil, it's Mike. The only the only thing I want to add to Don's comments is hopefully you've seen over the last couple quarters, the discipline that we're putting in those areas. And then I just ask you to keep an eye on the next couple quarters as we continue to work through our initiatives, that you should be able to see that we are putting a high hurdle as Don mentioned, on ourselves and putting a strict discipline on ourselves in both the OpEx and the CapEx areas.\nOperator: Thank you. Go ahead.\nKristina Kazarian: Oh, perfect, Sheela.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time that we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back over to Kristina Kazarian for closing remarks.\nKristina Kazarian: Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or clarifications on topics discussed this morning, our team will be available to take your call. And with that, thanks for joining us.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Hey, Manav, this is Ray Brooks. Thanks for the question. Our first goal has always been to complete the construction of the facility started up, and then optimize the refinery. And when I say optimize, optimize the carbon intensity of the operation, and then also the feedstock slate. And so I'm really happy to report that the plant completed construction about three weeks early, and is currently in startup as Mike said to earlier. I'm also happy that we were able to go from shovel to start up in under two years. Doing this while navigating through two North Dakota winters and a pandemic, and I just want to state that I'm really, really proud of the team for everything that they've accomplished. I was just out at the site, and it's really impressive facility, you might think that a 12,000 barrel day plant is small, but it's now the second largest renewable diesel plant in the United States. And getting to your question on the feed slate, the initial feed slate is 10,000 barrels a day of soybean oil, 2,000 barrels a day of corn oil. And we'll work diligently to make sure that we optimize that within any capabilities that we have. But I just want to say that we're really excited about the Dickinson plant being an early mover in the renewable diesel space. Pivoting to Martinez and I'll just talk a little bit about Martinez to give you a little bit more information you're looking for. But we're excited about Martinez from the standpoint that we have a facility with three hydro processing units, two hydrogen plants and an extensive infrastructure that gives us a very capital efficient project. And it gives us a capital efficient project from the standpoint that we will be able to run a multitude of feedstocks, whether it's soy, whether it's corn, whether it's tallow, whether it's use cooking oil. We are designing that flexibility into the program, into the project. And we're working diligently right now talking to feedstock suppliers as far as potential partners with us from the feedstock standpoint on that. The Martinez project, a little bit farther out there, while Dickinson is currently in operation. Martinez, we're working hard to get to that point. But now what we've done in the last quarter, we've submitted applications for our air permit. We've also submitted the initial study for the environmental impact report. We've completed our feasibility engineering and moved into detailed engineering. And we've also met with key regulatory, governmental and NGO stakeholders. So, we're continuing to move that along. And then part of moving that along will also be on the feedstock supply. So, we're not ready to tell you exactly what we're going to do on that, just tell you that we're working on it. Yes. I think it's a little premature. We want to give that guidance. We know everybody wants that guidance, Paul, we gave you fourth quarter of what we expect the West Coast to do. But we're going to start tracking and providing color around what I would say is the costs to run or that the incremental costs at Martinez, that we're incurring on a quarterly basis, so that you can see that. And obviously, as we trend to a renewable diesel facility, there's going to be some period of time where we're incurring costs, but we're not incurring or not delivering any sort of throughput through that refinery. But we will be doing that kind of guidance and providing that outlook information sort of on a quarterly basis as we move into 2021."

            "content": "Yes, Manav, this is Brian Partee. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So we've got the distribution channel all set up. We're working through the production and startup. It is a complex distribution network as you'd expect, and it's new too. So we've got transit time, so we'll be loading out the  rail. So a lot of flexibility as we hit the rail in North Dakota, and then we'll be moving it to the Pacific Northwest, where we'll be able to get to the water from there. So, both from rail domestically, as well as into Canada, we have a lot of flexibility to move, and then we'll be on the water out in the West Coast to hit as you noted, California, and frankly, wherever else we see the demand. From a marketing standpoint, as is typical, we've got a full portfolio to optimize how we sell into the market, both bulk sales. We've got committed contract sales as well as open rack sales. So we're excited to see the production come on. We're very optimistic placing into the market has not been a problem. So we've got things lined up and ready to go. In startup, though, we think probably mid to late December, so we've got oil in. Cash in is really important, obviously on the other end of thing. So we'll probably be mid to late December on that, and then really set up well for Q1 of 2021 to be rolling with the full production and full distribution. Yes, thanks Mike. Prashant, good morning. This is Brian Partee. So great question, and I appreciate the recognition that we're in kind of unique environment here to optimize commercially. But just a couple of high-level comments and things to think about where we're focused. I mean, the first one is really around alignment, and that alignment being with people. So we did a pretty heavy restructuring, I have responsibility for all the clean products value chain. So aligning our marketing folks, our supply folks and our training folks into one unified team that are focused geographically, we think is a very positive step, will allow us to operate more efficiently and effectively going forward. And frankly, with the right people in the right space. The second part of focus really here in the short-term is around inventory levels. So we're operating in a different demand environment. So two things we're looking at there. One is, inventory levels and opportunities around inventory reductions, and then related distribution costs. So as Mike stated we're really focused on things that we can control. And those are two things we feel in the short to medium-term are really under our control. And the last part I'll mention before handing it back over to Rick is on the export side. So exports, we believe are foundational and fundamental to helping the business in North America clear, and we're really focused there, developing a broader long-term strategy around how to hit markets outside of the U.S., and utilize our full both production capacity as well as our logistical capacity, primarily along the Gulf Coast, but also on the West Coast as well."

            "content": "Yes, Prashant. This is Rick, thank you for the question. Also, on the crude side from a distribution standpoint, we're certainly going towards more of a just-in time asset model, reducing our distribution costs, that's becoming readily apparent in our results. And in addition to that, when you look at crude avails, we've significantly shifted to light suite. You'll see that in our run rate here in the third quarter, so the adaptability the optionality the switch significantly to light suit runs throughout our operating area has been significant. And then as we look forward, we're looking at medium sours. We've come off a very, very disruptive storm season. And we're starting to see some signs of medium sours getting back to normal. And then we're seeing a little bit of a glimmer of hope from the Canadian side, when you look at the mandate that's been lifted. We're entering the diluent blending season, which will swell the pool. So we're optimistic on a few of the alternative grades, especially that we run in our midcontinent system."

            "name": "Don Templin",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. MPC's adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion for the third quarter of 2020. In addition to the adjustment for turnaround costs, adjusted EBITDA excludes net pre-tax charges of $525 million recorded in the third quarter, which are summarized on Slide 5. We recorded $348 million of restructuring expense related to the indefinite idling of our Martinez and Gallup facilities, as well as costs associated with our announced workforce reduction plan. Yes. Doug, I might add in Mike's comments, he talked about at the end of the first quarter, when we had our earnings call, we told you all that we were targeting two things around reducing capital and reducing our expenses. And we'd indicated that we were planning to reduce our capital by about $1.4 billion. I think we're trending probably $100 million to $200 million better than that right now. Most of that would be on the R&M side of the business, but we're also seeing some improvement on the MPLX side of the business. With respect to the - and you'll recall that that $1.4 billion of reductions was split sort of evenly $700 million for MPLX, $700 million for the rest of them MPC. With respect to the cost reductions that we were targeting $950 million that was $750 million for MPC, excluding MPLX, and $200 million for MPLX. MPLX is doing well against their target and we'll do better than they were targeting. And I think where we've really seen the difference and the improvement and the effort is around our R&M part of the business, particularly the refining part of the business. So I mentioned that our operating costs have been averaging about $1.27 billion a quarter since we made that announcement, that's about $350 million better than the first quarter of 2019. So if you just extrapolated that sort of $350 million a quarter, that gets you to - and our guidance for the fourth quarter is right in that same range, that would get you to about $1.50 billion against what was a target of $750 million. So, we feel really good about our ability to deliver that cost reduction. You're welcome, Doug. It was around the process for returning shares, or share repurchase or a capital return, if you will. Yes. So let me take sort of your second question first, Roger, in terms of a tax refund. So, we anticipate that we will have a relatively significant NOL this year, and we will have the ability to carry that back into prior years. We have not yet published our 10-Q, but I'll kind of give you sort of a preview in the 10-Q, you'll see in the cash flow statement that there's an increase in tax receivables of about a $1 billion. So right now, that will be the - what we will be having as a receivable sitting on our balance sheet related to our forecast right now of that sort of refund. Obviously, lots of things can happen between now and the end of the year. If there's a change in administration or we see a change in tax law, between now and the end of the year, there's probably some knobs that we may want to or levers that we may want to manage to make sure that we're optimizing our tax situation in 2020, and in 2021. But right now, I would say that numbers in sort of the $1 billion-ish range that will be on the balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. The other thing in terms of timing, I think realistically, the timing is probably third quarter, not second quarter. And the reason I say that is, we'll need to get everything closed, our tax returns filed, and then wait for the refund, and I just don't know how fast that will happen. But I think that it'll take some period of time into 2021 to get the tax return completed, all the things that we have to do. So, hopefully that's helpful from that perspective. And then I think you're right, in terms of the cash flow statement for the quarter, we had a fairly large working capital impact. And we highlighted one piece of that working capital impact that related to accruals that we made with respect to the restructurings that we were doing. I guess, the other piece that's in the working capital adjustment, so in the $868 million, you'll recall that we had a $256 million charge for LIFO liquidations. So that $256 million charge is showing up as a negative, if you will, in cash flow - cash flow from operations. And then the reduction in the inventory is showing up as a source of cash in the cash flow statement from working capital. So, there's a bit of - our cash flow statement probably is a little bit has some unusual items in it this quarter because of some of the charges that we've recorded. As we think forward, I mean, we were pleased with where we ended up with cash, as the quarter end was at $716 million. And if you think about sort of the change from the second quarter about $300 million change, and $200 million of that change was really because we paid down some debt at MPLX. So I think a pretty strong cash quarter for us, given the situation and the environment in which we're operating. That's year-to-date, Roger. So that will be in the cash flow statement. The cash flow statement has not done for a quarter, the cash flow statement has done for a year-to-date period. So that $1 billion is in the year-to-date number. Hey, Manav, this is Don. One other just sort of point to raise, you'd asked about sort of the cost to move Dickinson product to the West Coast. So, you probably saw in our outlook information that distribution costs went up slightly. And that sort of slight change in distribution costs is reflective of the distribution costs related to getting the Dickinson product to the West Coast. You're welcome, Manav. Benny, this is Don. Thanks for that question. So, I think one of the things that we've been very focused on over let's say the last four quarters or so, with feedback from you all and from our investors, is that there was sort of a request or a suggestion that will be helpful, if we stabilized the way we were reporting the information to you all, so that it was consistent quarter-to-quarter without a lot of changes, so that you could get to a point where your models could get tightened up refined, whatever the right terminology is. So, I think we've gotten to that point. This quarter was obviously a quarter with lots of moving pieces, including the discontinued operations. And we didn't think that it was an appropriate quarter to introduce a whole bunch of other changes. Mike's talked about how we're restructuring the company, how we're optimizing it, there's a lot of changes that are still occurring. And I guess it would be our view, my view that the best time to roll out sort of a new way of thinking about how the company presents its information and operates is when we get through some of that transition, so that we can do at one time. We can recast all the prior periods. We can provide you all the data that you need to update your models timely, and avoid any sort of confusion or situations where the information isn't as clear. So yes, we are thinking about how the company should look and how we should be presenting that information. This just wasn't the right time to do that. But we will be looking for the right time to think about how we present that information. And we do welcome feedback from you all and from the investors on what's the right way to or what's helpful in terms of information that we can provide that allows you to understand our business better. So Paul, let me try to, I think dissect the question or questions that you asked around our performance. So, the first one was, our operating costs have - the team has been performing very well, I mean, very much of a focus area for us. And we're very pleased with the progress that we're making there. So, I think that on a per barrel basis, we probably not only were the absolute costs, lower than we were projecting them to be. But our throughputs were slightly higher. And you have to remember, that guidance was provided at the end of the second quarter, and there was still a lot of uncertainty around what was happening with COVID and what the numbers would be. We've I think, stabilized a little bit in terms of the utilization rates. And so our guidance that we're giving for the fourth quarter, is pretty consistent with the actual that we incurred in the third quarter. And we have a lot of confidence sort of in providing that information. I think you asked about the West Coast and the costs on the West Coast. So, in our operating costs for the West Coast, there are still some continuing costs related to the Martinez Refinery and the idling there. And so, those are obviously putting sort of pressure, if you will, on the per barrel, and there's no equivalent operations at Martinez. So that would have some upward pressure on the per barrel cost. And then I think you were interested in maybe capture rate and sort of how the capture rate was significantly higher than we've historically guided to. So, I think most people model to a 90% capture rate. I think one of the things that happens is when your margins are thin, small variations can cause the capture rate to either be very high or very low. So this quarter, a couple of the factors that impacted the capture rate, I think, for purposes of modeling going forward, I would still be focused on in a normal world, a 90% capture rate, I would then think that I would want to add something for direct dealers, so let's just say, $100 million a quarter or in that range. And then the other things, I think, move about sort of quarter-to-quarter. So, hopefully, that's helpful. But I think part of what made the capture rate look as strong as it was this quarter, was the margins were very thin. Yes, Prashant. This is Don. So, with respect to the guidance that we gave at the end of the first quarter, the $950 million, that at the time did not envision, that we would - I guess we'd not embarked upon the workforce reduction plan that we just initiated and implemented. So, some of those costs would have been variable costs from operating in an environment where we anticipated that utilization rates would be lower than historical. What I can say and one of the things that we have been able to deliver, I mentioned on the refining side, the whole reduction for R&M or onsite for MPC, excluding MPLX was $750 million for the year 2020. And based upon what we've achieved and what we're guiding, we're probably closer to $1.50 billion or maybe slightly higher than that on an MPC, excluding MPLX basis. So, what that means is that, yes, there's still some variable costs that would have been, might go up as we ramp up operations into 2021. But a lot of the change that we've seen so far is around fixed costs. And so that gives us great confidence going forward. With respect to the workforce reduction, so that was more than 2,000 of our employees were impacted by those actions. Some of those were focused at the Martinez Refinery and the Gallup refinery, but a lot of those were also focused across the rest of the operation. So, you should start seeing some of those costs being embedded in our future projections. And I think, several of those costs, you'll see when we give our first quarter 2021 guidance, you'll be able to see, I think, a meaningful piece of that in the guidance that we give in 2021, but we've not moved that far forward yet. Yes, Phil, I mean, as I mentioned, and Mike mentioned in the early comments, we're very, very focused on managing capital right now. As it relates to 2021, we've not gotten to the position where we're providing that guidance. We'll get our budget approved later in the year and we'll provide that guidance when we get to our yearend earnings call. But what I can say is that, particularly from the R&M side of the business, we are investing or continuing the investment in projects that are ongoing or that we're completing. And we are very focused on eliminating, I'll call it sort of discretionary spending unless it is in sort of promoting our cost reduction initiatives. So, there was a time probably where our growth spending on the R&M side of the world was more about, I'll call it molecule management, and trying to take sort of, take what we're producing and upgrade what we're producing. I think right now, given the environment we're in, a lot of what we're focused on, on the discretionary spending is on allowing us to be able to manage in a very competitive, low margin environment. So, with those parameters, I think that's what we're doing on the MPC side. On the MPLX side, I mean, the same kind of discipline there. Mike talked about the fact that we feel very good about being positioned in a place where the cash flow from MPLX will cover not only distributions and CapEx, but will have availability then to have that excess cash to deploy to repurchasing units. So very, very focused. Discretionary capital needs to meet a very, very high hurdle, and it needs to be really focused on the initiatives that, Mike has laid out, which is, improving our competitive performance, or reducing our cost structure."

            "content": "Thanks, Kristina, and thanks for joining our call this morning. Slides 3, highlights our company's three strategic areas of focus in the near-term. Building and executing on these three strategic pillars will enable us to position the company for long-term success and through cycle resiliency. As we continue to navigate the challenges created by COVID-19, for both our company and the industry, we've remained focused on the aspects of our business within our control. This includes, strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance, and lowering our cost structure. On Slide 4, we provide a quick update on actions taken around those three strategic priorities this quarter. First, we're making good progress on the sales of Speedway business and continue to target the first quarter of 2021 to close the transaction. The Speedway and 7-Eleven teams are very focused on completing the activities required to successfully close the transaction. Additionally, our interactions with the FTC have been constructive. We also wanted to provide more color around the use of proceeds from the Speedway sale, since we have continued to receive questions about an MPLX buy in. As you know, we ran a comprehensive midstream review process that began last year, and we announced the results of that review earlier this year. Our conclusion from that process has not changed. We've remained committed to using the sale proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to MPC shareholders, and do not intend to buy an MPLX with cash from the Speedway sale. As it relates to MPLX, however, we continue to position MPLX towards free cash flow after distributions and capital, in order to proceed with unit buybacks which have now been authorized by the MPLX Board. One of our most important priorities as we evaluate the use of proceeds is our commitment to defending an investment grade credit profile. We expect to target in MPC alone debt-to-EBITDA leverage metric of 1 to 1.5 times. Given the significant and stable distributions from MPLX, we don't envision an MPC balance sheet with less than $5 billion of debt on a true cycle basis. As a reminder, we also expect to increase the cash component of our core liquidity position, by an additional $1 billion to offset for the loss of cash flows from Speedway. Within this framework and based on our current assessment, we expect that the remaining proceeds will be targeted for shareholder return. We are evaluating the form and timing and we'll share our plans closer to their transaction close. Thanks, Don. I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership. We recently published our 2020 perspectives on climate related scenarios report, highlights of which can be found on Slide 17 in the appendix. This is the fourth year we have published our TCFD compliant report, which highlights the opportunities and strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. As a result of continued refinements of our ESG perspectives, we want to mention two additional and important initiatives we have established, incremental to our announcement earlier this year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity to 30% below 2014 levels by 2030. First, we've established a 2025 goal to reduce methane emissions intensity from our natural gas business to 50% below 2016 levels. Second, we're focusing on conserving and managing our use of water. Through our efforts in this area, we have reduced our freshwater withdrawal intensity by over 10% since 2015, and we expect to further reduce it by an additional 10% by 2030. Hey. Good morning, Doug. So I'll give you couple of comments. Number one, we stated continuously that our goals have been to put the balance sheet back in order and return capital MPC shareholders. So, we still believe that that's our first priority here. And as you look at what we've done over the last couple of months, we've enhanced our base case on shareholder return with the change from a spin of Speedway into a sale of Speedway, which I do believe is a win-win for both ourselves and for 7-Eleven. But as we look at the equities, I mean we certainly acknowledge the argument the people have made about, like you said, a 15% yield or so around MPLX. At the same time, we view both equities are very undervalued. Particularly we view the MPC considerably undervalued compared to where we think it should be long-term. And if you dovetail that with our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, we think the best value is to return capital in the form of buying back units in MPC. We believe that the yield at MPLX should improve with our base plans at MPLX, which we noted today that we are going to continue to proceed into a free cash flow after distributions in capital at MPLX, and put ourselves in a position to start buying back MPLX's units with MPLX cash flow, and then we can target MPC cash at MPC shareholders in a form of buybacks. We also mentioned on the call that we still have a little bit of time before we get to closing, which we're still anticipating first quarter. But we're going to continue to look at, we've said form and timing of those buybacks is something we're continuing to evaluate, continuing to talk to our Board about. But at the end of the day, we think it's a much better value proposition for MPC shareholders, and we believe it's the right use of proceeds. Yes. Thanks, Doug. A couple of comments, on the portfolio, obviously, the most important things we've been going we've been very public about. I mentioned Speedway sale is a win-win. I think at the end of the day, 7-Eleven is getting a quality team and a group of assets that enhance their portfolio. At the same time, MPC is monetizing the retail margin by keeping the fuel supply chain, so I think that's an important portfolio step for us. We've also talked about moving into the renewable space. We can give a little more color on that as well, but we're starting up a facility up in North Dakota. We're continuing plans at Martinez. So, those are the major portfolio discussions that we have going in our public about at this time. I will tell you that, we continue to look at our portfolio and our goal is to make sure that we have a competitive set of assets that can manage through any type of tough environments, like we're experiencing today. The other thing that hopefully you are going to continue to see on a quarter-to-quarter basis, is our cost cutting efforts and time to change the cost structure of the company. One of my styles is not to get ahead of ourselves, because we continue to work at it. We're continuing internally to challenge ourselves in different areas. So the best way to stay apprised of that effort is to look at our quarterly results, as we continue to report out each quarter. And I think you'll see a sense of concentration on this area. And you'll be able to really see what we're delivering as far as costs restructuring of the company. Yes. Doug, again, there's always a lot of rumors. We're not expecting to exit our assets on the Gulf Coast, we are expecting to evaluate all of our assets. And we're looking at ways that we can reduce our cost structure in the Gulf Coast, on the West Coast and in the midcontinent. But right now, I think, the important thing for you to think about is, look at the results that we're delivering, try and get a good assessment of where you see the costs, I'll let Don comment on that specifically. And then continue to get updates from us on a quarterly basis, and we'll try and give you as much color as we can as to how that occurred. One of the tough things in our business is, we did implement a workforce reduction. As I said, in my prepared remarks, that's a very difficult decision for us, but we thought it was necessary for the long-term viability of the Corporation. Good morning, Neil. So on your first part, I mean, the process is going along as expected. We did receive a second request from the FTC. And we were expecting that, 7-Eleven was expecting that. So the teams are working through the questions that have come out of that review. Overall, I would say, in general, it just takes time to get through that process. And as a result of that, that's why we've targeted this first quarter timing. We don't see anything at this moment that takes us off of that timing. Obviously, if we did, we would communicate that. But right now the process is going I'd say as expected and the situation is such that we have not seen any surprises. Our anticipation of what the FTC would ask is very consistent with what 7-Eleven was thinking as well. So overall, I'd say the process is on target. And our expectation is still for a first quarter close. I just forgot - what was the second question, I forget. Okay. Yes. And on that, Neil, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that, we've tried to put some clarity on use of proceeds. As Doug mentioned, there was a lot of questions around MPLX buy in. And we wanted to definitively state that our goal is not to buy an MPLX with this cash, but to return to shareholders, as well as get the balance sheet in order. We're not ones, it's not in our DNA to predict what's the mid cycle going to be. But we thought, we'd give a little bit more clarity by some of our scenario planning, which basically said that we don't see the debt on the balance sheet at MPC going below $5 billion. I mean, hopefully, that gives a little more clarity as we do our scenario planning. We want to have an appropriate amount of leverage at MPC. And so we thought that that was a good disclosure for the market to understand how we're thinking about it. As far as the return, we're still in that process. We have several more months to go before we reach the closure point. Myself, Don, the Board, the whole team is evaluating with our advisors. And I think you hit it on the head, what's the most efficient way for us to return that capital? And that's exactly what we have been debating. And as you know, there's a lot of different ways that you can return that capital, there are pros and cons to each of those. And it's our expectation that as we get closer to the close, we'll give a little bit more clarity there. But that's where we are in the process at this point. Hey, Neil, I'll start and Don can jump in if he likes or Ray. One of the things that I think is occurring with COVID is it's forcing rationalization in this industry, and you don't want a faster pace that would normally be occurring in a downward cycle. So, one of the things that I think we're seeing across the board, certainly for Marathon, we've announced that we are changing the configuration at Martinez, that's our goal at this point to move it to renewable diesel as a result of its cost structure. And we've also put Gallup in a shutdown mode. So, our view is the tough challenge, whether it's the West Coast, or whether it's global worldwide, the industry is under a lot of stress right now. And the way cyclical industries get out of that stress is rationalization. And our expectation is that COVID is just accelerating that. Overall, Neil my motto is, we're going to worry about the things we can control and keep an eye on the things that we don't control. The things we do control out on the West Coast specifically is moving expeditiously the change, what we believe was a high cost asset that would not survive in the long-term, processing hydrocarbons and moving that to renewable diesel. And we have an update on that in our prepared remarks, like I said, or Ray can go into a little bit more. But that's something that we do control. So, we're moving forward with that study. At the same time, we are continuing to evaluate costs back on the West Coast, as well as the rest of the company. Don just gave you, hopefully, a lot more color on what we're doing in that area. And then again, I'll just reiterate that our style will be such that every quarter we'll try and give you an update on these major initiatives, and tell you how we're progressing with Martinez, tell you how we're progressing with our cost initiative, and any changes to the portfolio we'll be happy to update as time goes by. You're welcome, Neil. Roger, I think, you pointed out and like you said we addressed that a little bit on Neil's question is, at the end of the day, one of the things that the industry is struggling with is, the loss of demand that's occurred and been accelerated as a result of COVID. That demand has recovered quite a bit, but it's not back to the levels that we've seen previous to the virus. Overall, gasoline and diesel are obviously doing much better than jet fuel. But at the end of the day, this is a commodity business, it's a margin business. And to your very point, the way that the industry gets itself back into a good position is twofold, is one is demand recovers to the point of post-Coronavirus, whenever that occurs, hopefully vaccines are progressing, as we've been reading about. And I'm sure you guys have been reading about, so the expectation for that to occur sooner is great news. And that'll help on the demand side. And then on the supply side, it's purely a matter of math and marginal assets, we'll have to rationalize. If you look at some of the data, even outside the U.S. that rationalization is occurring and the bottom line is in a new world, wherever that may be, from a demand standpoint, or whatever, marginal assets will not be able to sustain themselves long-term. And the main reason that one of our key short-term initiatives is get our cost structure in a position that can manage these types of dips in commodity markets. So, one of our important goals is to make sure that we continue to progress, our cost structure changes, and I think you'll continue to see that quarter after quarter as we work on these initiatives, and position ourselves so that we're not the marginal assets. To Neil's point, whether it's West Coast-related or U.S.-related or globally-related, at the end of the day rationalization will occur, is occurring, will continue to occur and hopefully, demand comes back and the industry gets itself back on a better footing. Hey, Benny, this is Mike. So, couple things. Number one, I'll say prior to COVID, the number one question we were getting asked was, the gas portion of MPLX in the midstream business. And since COVID, I mean, obviously, a lot of things have changed. And we're looking at a gas strip that has a three in front of it now compared to what was some pretty tough natural gas prices. So, our view longer-term, and we've kind of stated this, so I'm going to just repeat myself a little bit is, MPLX is an important part of MPCs structure. We really rely on that stable dividend that comes out or distribution that comes out of MPLX. It's an important part of our structure. At the same time, we do believe the midstream business is going to continue to grow. To you point, albeit maybe at a different pace, if the E&P business and goes to a little slower mode. But being a natural gas we think is an important thing right now, as the market continues to evolve in the energy landscape, natural gas in our view is going to continue to be an important part of growth. At the same time, as I mentioned earlier, we do believe we'll get back to normal once we get through the virus and have a vaccine and get demand back in our LMS business as well. We have a couple projects in play right now that will bring additional earnings. So, the forward growth structure there may be a little slower than originally anticipated, as a result of the E&P change. But at the end of the day, we think it's going to be a very strong contributor and continue to have growth that will continue to increase earnings, as far as even at MPLX, which continues to add value for both MPLX and MPC. At the end of the day, I'd tell you one of the things that I think has been misunderstood a little bit is, the stability of the earnings at MPLX. And hopefully, this quarter it gets to show how much we think how strong that earnings profile is, as well as it being supplemented by cost reductions that we've talked about as well. And, Paul, this is Mike. On your question on the greenhouse gas emissions intensity target, and whether it's enough, I think a couple points I wanted to point out. First off, we think it's more important to have kind of a mid-range goal instead of just a 2050 goal. But it's important to note that the background for our goal there is, so our goal of 30% reduction by 2030 from 2014 levels represents about a 2% reduction per year in carbon intensity, which is the slope necessary to meet the desired reductions, or aspirations of the Paris agreement by 2050. So, in order to kind of stay on track to that, we set a goal of 2030 that we believe kind of aligns with that longer-term 2040 to 2050 goal. And as time progresses, we will amend the target on a periodic basis to ensure we remain in line with those longer-term aspirations. But we thought it was more important to kind of show the slope and put a target out there that was more near in, so it was more achievable rather than so far out, that it doesn't - it gets a gets a little bit discounted. The other thing I do want to mention, Paul, aside from the greenhouse gas emissions intensity, I do want to reiterate, something we said in our prepared remarks is that we have stated, 2025 goal to reduce methane emissions intensity. And I think that's a significant ESG move on our part, as well as setting a goal on freshwater withdrawal intensity. Those are two other important areas, where we believe that we can make progress in this area and continue our commitment in the ESG area. You're welcome. Hey, Prashant. This is Mike. I'll turn it over to Brian and Rick to give a comment. Although, I just want to remind you that in the commercial area, that's probably the toughest area for us to give disclosures, just because of the competitive nature to it, but I'll let the guys give a comment if they like. Phil, it's Mike. The only the only thing I want to add to Don's comments is hopefully you've seen over the last couple quarters, the discipline that we're putting in those areas. And then I just ask you to keep an eye on the next couple quarters as we continue to work through our initiatives, that you should be able to see that we are putting a high hurdle as Don mentioned, on ourselves and putting a strict discipline on ourselves in both the OpEx and the CapEx areas."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session . Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Don Templin, CFO and other members of the Executive Team.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. Yesterday we announced an agreement to sell Speedway to 7-Eleven for $21 billion in cash demonstrating our commitment to execute on the strategic priorities we outlined earlier this year. The sale of this business provides certainty around value realization for MPC shareholders. As I've stated before I believe this is a return of capital business and the substantial estimated after tax proceeds of approximately $16.5 billion enables us to both strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our shareholders. At the same time the sale also creates a long-term relationship with 7-Eleven that enhances commercial performance potential through attractive fuel supply agreements and future growth opportunities. The transaction which is subject to customary closing conditions including HSR clearance is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2021. We move on to slide 4, as a follow-up to our first quarter earnings call, we're making very difficult decisions to increase profitability, create stronger through cycle earnings and drive long-term value creation. Despite the very challenging conditions in today's market we remain committed to those goals and will continue each quarter to update the market as we progress. We outlined three areas that will be priorities towards achieving our objectives. First, strengthening the competitive position of our portfolio. We need to be a leader in cost, operating and financial performance metrics need to make necessary changes to the portfolio to achieve these objectives. One of our key philosophies is that each asset needs to generate cash back to the business. We announce the decision to indefinitely idle our Gallup and Martinez refineries. Closures as a result of the tough refining business climate ahead of us have been amplified by the impact of the pandemic. At Martinez we are evaluating repurposing the refinery towards the production of renewable diesel. Facility has the ability to provide up to 48,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel. We have the unique opportunity to take advantage of the strong set of logistics assets for the area and also have three significant processing units that are an ideal fit for making renewable diesel. These advantages should drive significantly lower capital requirements compared to greenfield investments and pursued enable initial production as early as 2022 with the option to ramp up from there.\nDon Templin: Thanks Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning we reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.33. This adjustment reflects a $1.5 billion pre-tax lower of cost or market inventory benefit. Adjusted EBITDA was $653 million for the quarter. Cash from operations before working capital changes was a cash source of $172 million. Our dividend payments for the quarter were $378 million.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks Don. I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership. We\u2019ve recently published our 2019 sustainability report highlights of which can be found on slide 18 in the appendix. The report is greatly expanded this year in terms of content and disclosure and outlines our commitment to provide information consistent with the many reporting frameworks that are influential in the investment community. As such the report summarizes our comprehensive efforts related to environmental, social and governance aspects of our business. On that note I wanted to touch on recent events that have impacted many of the places where we live and work. At Marathon we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace and to partnering with organizations in the communities where we operate to encourage acceptance, tolerance and unity. Like many companies we are charting a path towards greater understanding, listening and open dialogue and we are firmly committed to continuing to make progress in this very important area. With that let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits we will re-prompt for additional questions. We will now open the line to questions. Operator? \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you and congratulations Mike, Don, Kristina team on the transaction. The first topic is around cash flow. Can you talk about the pieces that go into the tax number that bridge between $21 billion and $16.5 billion and with the cash what's the framework around allocating cash; recognizing we'll get more color around this later and thoughts on debt reduction versus buybacks versus special dividends and then I do have a follow-up. \nMike Hennigan: Hey Neil. Thanks for the comment. First of all before answering the question on use of proceeds let me just make a couple comments on the deal itself. First of all we looked at a lot of different structures and a lot of different options and then came to conclusion that this deal creates the most value and the most certainty for our shareholders.\nDon Templin: Yes. Neil I guess, you asked a couple of questions, maybe let me first talk a little bit about because I think it's important around our consideration of use of proceed. Let me talk a little bit about how we think about defending our investment grade credit profile. So maybe backtrack just a month or two when we had our first quarter earnings call liquidity was probably top of mind and I think we took some very proactive actions to make sure that we had addressed that issue and as I mentioned on our comments now we have $7.7 billion or so of available liquidity. So we feel like we're well-positioned, well-situated going forward. As we think about as we look ahead, I guess that we believe that an important part of our capital structure is an appropriate level of debt. We don't think it's efficient in this environment to be under levered but we also want to make sure that we're defending our investment grade credit profile. And as I think about defending our investment grade credit profile, no one metric or factor drives that consideration. We'll look to a number of inputs that include obviously the lost EBITDA from the Speedway sale but we'll also consider the steady cash flows we have from our ownership interest in MPLX, our views around mid-cycle and through cycle EBITDA, the size of our committed credit facilities which are very significant and the cash we currently have on our balance sheet which is a billion dollars, our dividend policy going forward and various metrics such as debt to EBITDA and debt to capital but I think that all of those things will be a part of the consideration and as Mike mentioned the unprecedented macro environment makes it difficult right now to be more specific. You did ask a question about tax and so on that particular topic our tax basis and the assets that we're selling was just under $4 billion so the after tax proceeds that were showing in the release the $16.5 billion is really predicated on that tax basis.\nNeil Mehta: That's very clear. The follow-up is bigger picture question which is -- in many ways you are losing your most valuable business. Now you're monetizing it at a great multiple but can you talk Mike about how you think about value creation for here and what you're left with is MPLX and refining business; how do you drive value out of those two business segments and set up the company over the long term without the stable ratable cash flow of Speedway? \nMike Hennigan: Hey Neil, that's a good question. Let me make one comment on the Speedway deal relative to that is we still believe we're going to get the benefit of integration. That's not loss because of the supply agreement that we have and the fact that we'll continue to be using our logistics assets but to your broader question, we still have a lot of work to do in the three areas that I keep mentioning. So strengthening the portfolio is going to continue to be a theme that you'll hear from us over time as we continue to look at our assets. We're just getting into the midst of improving our commercial performance. So you'll hear more about that over time as well. As well as the cost structure. We've given some early indications for 2020 to lower our cost structure by about $950 million but we have more work to do in that area. So you have a real good question, where do we go from here and I just ask you to keep thinking about those three priorities. We're going to continue to report on those. We're certainly not done from this standpoint. We've looked at obviously a couple of assets in that regard and obviously getting the Speedway deal done was a high priority for us. And I think it does put us in a unique position to return capital shareholders as Don mentioned to get the balance sheet in the right order. So I think we're in a good position relative to the environment that we're in and we expect that to stay challenged for some time. Although we're optimistic that just like all these cycles we'll get out of it at some point and we're seeing a slow recovery which is headed in the right direction but we're just anticipating that it could take a while to get back to normal.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks Mike. Appreciate it.\nMike Hennigan: You are welcome, Neil. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we will hear from Doug Legate with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nDoug Legate: Thanks. Good morning everybody and Mike let me add my congrats to that great multiple on Speedway. So I have two questions if I may. The first one is actually about Martinez and Gallup. I wonder if you could just walk us through the process that got you to the conclusion that you came to -- was there an option for example for a sale. Is it an inventory liquidation event that comes out of this and maybe if you could frame for us what other assets in the portfolio today don't meet that criteria of generating positive cash flow. A - Mike Hennigan Yes Doug, also very good question. I'll start with Gallup and like I said in my prepared remarks these are very difficult decisions for us to contemplate during some really tough times. I mean COVID has had an impact on many people in many different ways but it's obviously had a real strong impact on our business and the business and climate that we're seeing going forward is especially with refining supply and demand and obviously that's more weighted towards the demand side but anyway to answer the question we had a unique niche in the marketplace there that's essentially been competed away over time. So it's much more difficult for a small refinery to be successful but to answer your direct question we did look to sell the asset. We ran a process but unfortunately we did not get something that we could execute on. So absent the process being successful, we thought the next step was to put it in an indefinite idling position but still keep the logistics assets active so that we have some other opportunities from that standpoint and then we'll see how things play itself out. On Martinez, we did not look at a sale to your question there. We're pretty excited about the opportunity of reconfiguring the asset into renewable diesel. We got some more work to do there and I know we have a lot more detail but I do want to give you at least the direct answer to your question as to whether we looked at sales. We did at Gallup. We ran a process that wasn't successful. We did not at Martinez. So hopefully that answers that question. \nDoug Legate: It does and I appreciate the color there. Maybe I don't know if you want to take the next one with my follow-up as well Mike or if you want to throw it to Don but I'd like to preface the question but I'm just taking a look at MPLX's stock price or unit price since you did the IPO, I guess about seven or eight years ago and it's still trading below that level. I realize the MPLX processes is done and dusted so to speak but when you look at the outstanding equity and the amount of cash you just brought in why would it not make sense to buy in the balance of MPLX given that the incremental cost space still seems to weigh on your refining valuation? I'll leave it there. Thanks. A - Mike Hennigan Yes Doug, it's another good question and as you refer to our midstream study, whether it's bringing it all in or actually looking at the RLFD you're finding logistics and fuels distribution. We went through a pretty exhaustive study as you're aware and you referenced and the bottom line is we came to the conclusion that we didn't want to buy in a cash stream that we were already getting with respect to the RLFD. Marathon has a unique position where we're receiving about $1.8 billion in distributions from MPLX and RLFD is about $1.4 billion of EBITDA, so again I'm saying we came to that conclusion of why would we buy in that cash stream when we're getting it essentially via distributions and instead use that capital which would be north of $10 billion in return to MPC shareholders. So that's where we came out on the subset of it as far as all in at the end of the day there is some amount of cash flow that goes to partners on the one side of the fence. On the other side of the fence we'd be paying tax to a certain extent depending on where we think the tax rates will be going forward. So at this point and we do recognize and we are frustrated at the level of equity value that MPLX has at the same time we felt or continue to feel that the amount of capital that would be needed to do that at this time makes more sense to return to shareholders as opposed to not and obviously we've concentrated a lot on the Speedway unlock of value and that's kind of where our head is for right now and as I mentioned and Don commented as well is we're going to be doing a lot of analysis between now and the close to look at what's the best use of proceeds but the highlight priorities are the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders.\nDoug Legate: All right. Appreciate again for the answer guys. Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: Hey. thank you. Good morning.\nMike Hennigan: Good morning Roger.\nRoger Read: I guess maybe to follow up on kind of the whole restructuring and slide 4 where you've got the three kind of I guess guide posts I'll call it, where should we think about, where you are in the overall sort of evaluating the company, potentially restructuring the company and this is going to get back to some of the questions already been asked; do you buy an MPLX? Do you want to buy in a bunch of shares change the dividend, etc? But I'm just curious because you couldn't have known for certain about getting a sale of retail done until obviously you signed the papers even if the cash is still a few months away but now that you have certainty of that, how does that maybe affect the way and where are you maybe in terms of progress and doing an evaluation throughout the company on both sort of a current COVID basis and then on a maybe called more of a mid-cycle kind of \u201821/\u201922 outlook standpoint.?\nMike Hennigan: Yes Roger. So like you said on the three initiatives, we still have a lot of work to do on the portfolio. To your point we could not be assured that we would get this deal done. We were very optimistic because we believe Speedway is a really attractive asset out there. We did get significant interest and I think we concluded the deal that's in the best interest of ourselves, Speedway and 7-Eleven. As far as the portfolio though we still have a lot more work to do both on the refining side and the logistics side and the GMP side. I mean there's a lot of activity going on and the best I can give you is over time we'll continue to disclose how we're feeling about certain things. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves in the market but we want to get to a portfolio. Our goal is to get to a portfolio that generates significant free cash in any environment and for me personally I'm a protected downside. So knowing that we're going to have these down cycles we want to make sure the portfolio is very resilient during those times. As far as the other areas like I said, we're just starting to make some moves in the commercial area and that's the one area that I'm probably going to be the least disclosing about just because of the competitive nature and then the cost structure I think just keep an eye for each quarter as we continue to progress. My personal style is not to put out a big number and then try and track against it. It's more of a try to have continuous improvement in continuing to lower our costs in a lot of different ways and change our philosophy on cost and change our philosophy on capital discipline. So each of those I think Roger, each quarter we will be able to talk a little bit about how we've made progress in each of those areas and then hopefully you'll get to see over time how we're looking to maneuver the company. I hope that makes sense to you.\nRoger Read: It does. You are going to make us wait. That's always the hardest thing for us. As a follow-up and I know Don, you've already tried to address the tax issue but we've been getting a lot of questions in on it. I was just curious the other refiners for the most part have discontinued ETR guidance because the current environment and the CARE Act has some real impact. So I was just curious as we think about the 21 billion the 16.5 net are there other things that may flow through here in coming quarters, whether it's a going back and capturing prior profit tax payments or something else that might allow you to whittle down the tax impact on the sale?\nDon Templin: Yes Roger. In connection with sort of the effective tax rate, I mean 2020 was an unusual or is going to be an unusual year because as you look at least our book income we had significant charges related to goodwill and it has limited deductibility. So our first quarter and then year-to-date effective rate was in the sort of middle teens as a percentage really driven by that. What we spend all of our time doing is really looking hard at our cash tax position and as we disclosed in the first quarter and as we will disclose again in our second quarter 10-Q, we believe that as a result of the CARES Act we're anticipating that we will have net operating losses in 2020 given the environment and also given the significant capital expenditures that we've made in the past where we get to take the depreciation, deduction when assets are placed in service. So we expect that there will be a significant NOL and the CARES Act provides that you can carry that back up to five years and we would expect to carry back NOLs into years that -- given that five years that have a 35% tax rate. So we think that's a good thing for MPC. Our plan would be that we would work on getting our 2020 tax return filed as quickly as we could in 2021 to be able to affect that NOL carryback and the refund that would be associated with that. With respect to the sale of Speedway, obviously we will continue to evaluate that and we will look for ways to best optimize the tax position but we thought that it was appropriate for purposes of this announcement to give you that sales price minus the basis times what we believe was a normal tax rate at a relatively statutory rate.\nRoger Read: Okay just one minor follow-up on that in terms of -- when you file the 2020 return and \u201921, timing on a refund that's just my last data point. A - Don Templin We believe that happens relatively quickly but it who knows what the world looks like in 2021 if people are still working from home or still in their offices Roger but we believe that that's a relatively rapid transaction, not transaction a rapid result if you will. So we're going to push really, really hard to get our return filed as quickly as we can and then we would expect that the refund would manifest itself relatively quickly after that.\nRoger Read: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning guys.\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: My two questions if I could. I think earlier that you said that it doesn't make sense for you to buy  for the remaining of MPLX. So if the company considered that with far more flexibility with the cash infusion, whether that you may be open that do you want to spin off totally the MPLX? Whether that this is a consideration or that you still conclude after the exhausted evaluation that you're just going to keep the structure as it is? The second question is related to the Golden Eagle whether not shopping yet can you still one the renewable or that you want the renewable you need to shut it and in terms of the renewable how big is the business that you want that in the long haul for your business taking into consideration on one hand current margin and return are very good but on the other hand the barrier of entry is low and the margin and the demand and your sense with government mandate. So I want to see how you deal that business long haul. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: Hey Paul. So when the first one, we don't have any other comments other than as I mentioned we're going to do a lot of analysis. We have some time to look at what's the best thing to do with the proceeds but I do want to leave everybody with the priorities that we have are the balance sheet and returning capital. So one of the obvious things that we stated from the beginning with Speedway was we did want to unlock that value realization and returning capital is a high priority. So I don't want to comment on anything other than those at this point. On your questions on Martinez and renewable I'm going to turn to Ray in a second but let me just give a couple opening comments. So first off I think Martinez is in a unique set of circumstances relative to the hardware that exists at the facility and I'll let Ray talk about that. We are believer that the renewable positioning is going to be beneficial to us because it aligns with California's low carbon fuel standards. We've also stated MPC has greenhouse gas reduction targets that we want to accomplish throughout the decade. So strategically this fits with where our thinking is and I would just give you a little bit of framework as we think about capital investment there and this was the harder decision. The expected capital that we're going to put in for the first phase assuming we go with this is about the same amount of capital that we would put into a planned turnaround for the facility. So we really hit a decision point and decided to pivot and look at renewable diesel production as opposed to refined product production. So that's kind of the decision tree if you want to call it that. There is a lot of details that go into the analysis. So I'm going to let Ray give you a little bit more detail so you understand some of the specifics around Martinez its own specifics about the facility. \nRay Brooks: Hey thanks, Mike. Paul, I just want to give you a framework a little bit that we've actually been looking at Martinez for a long time essentially ever since we merged with Andeavor and early on we evaluated what you suggested co-processing for renewable diesel but those economics weren't nearly as strong as the conversion that we're looking at right now. The key item and Mike just hit on this is with the refinery continuing in its current form is that it has an extremely high cost structure and then we have the near-term headwinds with a heavy turnaround spend in the coming year. So we believe that transitioning Martinez to a renewable diesel plant ultimately creates value for our shareholders and there are certain unique advantages for this site. Our Martinez renewable diesel facility can provide up to 48,000 barrels per day of capacity and we expect the initial production could be online in 2022 and ramping up from there. We are continued to evaluate in more detail but the initial analysis looks extremely promising. Martinez current complexity presents a capital efficient project for us given that there are three high pressure hydro processing units. Retrofitting these units will allow for renewable diesel production equal to about one third of the current refinery's nameplate crew capacity. There are also the existing hydrogen plants, power generation and extensive inbound and outbound logistics that are all needed to produce renewable diesel. So our intention is to pivot to the production of higher value, low carbon intensity diesel for California. Martinez produces about 54,000 barrels per day of ULSD at full utilization and the conversion would produce up to 48,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel. I want to emphasize that this is not a grassroots facility. So there is an element of speed of conversion. We believe that we have an early mover advantage and we believe that there are opportunities for meaningful partnerships with feedstock suppliers. Now we fully understand that the drivers for the economics of this project are not our typical refinery project that there are regulatory drivers but at the end of the day with the unique advantages for Martinez that I talked about earlier we're just really excited to take this evaluation further.\nPaul Cheng: Ray and Mike can you give us some idea that for the company as a whole long term how big a renewable diesel business that you want to be or you're willing that to get you say a ceiling or you think that no there's no really no ceiling it depends on the opportunity set and also that after the Speedway itself who is going to keep win. That's it for me. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: Yes Paul, it's Mike. So I don't think we have a targeted number at this point but I do want to say that we're going to continue to look at the portfolio and make decisions as we go along. Martinez -- our priority as Ray said is going to be evaluating the different phases here. The other thing I would like to add for those who know me in the past, I believe joint venture arrangements can be very successful as well when you get into these types of deals. So managing the capital and achieving a better overall outcome for all parties is something else that we're looking at very hard here. So we're evaluating that approach. In general I think at the end of the day we think there's some real uniqueness here that should be beneficial. Ray gave a lot of technical stuff. I say on the commercial side we're going to talk a little bit about JV opportunities in the future. Managing the capital is one of our main criterias we want to have strict discipline. So that's another important piece of this. So I just wanted to make that comment. And I'm also going to let Brian make a comment as well.\nBrian Partee: Yes Paul. To your question the last question that you snuck in there regarding the rent as it relates to the Speedway separation just wanted to address that real quick. So I think the first thing to understand and appreciate that we've always had a market-based philosophy and approach to pricing with Speedway. So as a result of the separation fortunately due to that historical philosophy there's really no step changer movement and value shift but fundamentally MPC will be the blender of record in all transactions. So we will possess the rent and retain the rent. As it relates to the value of that rent that's all always driven by market specifics which is individual market by market and the agreement fully contemplates that. When you talk about a long-term agreement like this we have to make sure that it's resilient over time and the agreement fully contemplates this for rents or anything else frankly in the future. So that's the way it's going to be handled in agreement. So I mean just wanted to make the point underlined and underscore that there is no value shift whatsoever as a result of the transaction on rents.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Next we will hear from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.\nManav Gupta: Hey guys my question is on the crude sourcing side. During 2Q medium servers are very tight but as we move into 3Q we are seeing Russia and other OPEC countries raise those volumes. So do you expect more discounts or medium server crudes going in 3Q which could help your golf course results in 3Q? \nMike Hennigan: Hey Manav it's Mike. So rick's not here today. So I'll take a shot at that. He's out of the office today. I mean in general we think directionally the crude market is going to hopefully move towards us with increased production. As you stated we're going to have a little bit of a recovery in the production side of it which hopefully will put some pressure on differentials. Right at the moment as you're very aware refining crack spreads are still very weak and it's not been a good environment for refiners but as I mentioned earlier we're optimistic but cautious as recovery continues to progress hopefully we'll get to see a recovery and then refining margins which we haven't seen yet and as crew production continues to progress to your point then hopefully we'll get to see a little bit more opening on those spreads. I would Manav this might be a good opportunity let me let Tim and Brian make a comment on where we think we are in demand recovery. So I give you a little bit of a flavor of how we're seeing the demand side. So Tim why don't you start with gasoline and then Brian can finish up with the portfolio.\nTim Griffith: Yes you bet Mike. As Don referenced we've seen a really continuing amount of recovery in gasoline demand since the early April lows in really all regions of the country as many of the states have reopened with probably the greatest strength in the midwest really through the second quarter. Recovery trends nationwide have slowed more recently with system-wide weighted same store sales volumes currently down sort of 10% to 15% compared to last year with the east coast about 5% behind the midwest and the west coast another 5% behind that. So as referenced earlier we're watching carefully the latest COVID case escalation in multiple regions and the potential for states or counties to back up on the reopening plans. Schools going back to in person is a significant wild card on the demand side as students at home will have some consequence for the ability of parents to return to their workplaces and getting people back in the road. For what it's worth we also think the increasing requirements for masks nationwide is a positive for demand as it facilitates increased mobility with more things able to be open which potentially gets people back in the road to a meaningful extent. We'd much rather see people out on the roads with masks than at home without them. With that I'll turn it over to Brian for a diesel and jet.\nBrian Partee: Yes. Thanks Tim. So to continue on demand Manav I can kind of talk across our entire book. So to Tim's point we see the exit rate for July is down about 10% to 15% overall. So I can echo what Tim's seeing that just a couple of regional notes the one I guess downside note on a regionality is in the southwest. So with the resurgence in cases of COVID in the southwest we have seen a weakening here in the last several weeks in that particular region. On the bright side the midwest and Atlantic coast both recovered and they're down roughly 7% year-on-year across in total book which is a really good sign for the Atlantic coast as everybody knows that we're pretty hard hit up in the New York, New Jersey marketplace. On the diesel side we hit our low point just as a reminder in the early to mid April. We were off about 22% year-on-year. We exited July off about 10% and to Tim's point on demand profile we have seen since the fourth of July kind of a sideways motion as it relates to demand but it's been pretty stable over that period of time but somewhat in a plateaued manner. The downside regionally the great plains is off 15% to 20% a lot of that it has to do with the heavy demands up in the Bakken area that have curtailed as a result of drilling activity up in that market and then the upside regionally midwest is about 5% off and we're actually up in the southeast year-on-year on the distillate side Closing out on jet fuel in the second quarter we are off roughly 34% year-on-year a pretty big out performance relative to the market. A lot of that has to do with our sales mix. We're heavily levered to cargo sales which are really strong resurgence really since the COVID outbreak and even before that with online retailing really driving a lot of the demand in the midwest and also up in the Alaska market. July we're actually down year-on-year in the low teens. So really strong performance by our aviation team. That's really starting to see the fruits of the combination commercially with the endeavor portfolio and MPC coast to coast. A lot of the jet buyers they're levered across not only the U.S. but just globally so really been able to create richer relationships there to drive incremental capture of market share overall. Really the outlook on August is pretty flat to July. We expect to be some downside to that based on the resurgence and in both cases stay-at-home orders as well as quarantine and really the thing we're watching right now as we look at the September is what is demand going to look like in September given that a lot of schools are not returning to normal people are working from home. So there is definitely a pent-up demand of folks wanting to move around. So it's a bit of a wild card what demand is going to look like in September. You can make as good of an upside case as a downside case. We're watching it closely.\nTim Griffith: And then I'll just circle back to crude I know you asked about the gulf coast but hopefully Canadian differentials will start to widen a little bit as more production comes online into that market and then on the west coast we're starting to see some foreign economic alternatives like Russian grades, Brazilian grades, etc. etc. So it's been pretty tough sledding for refiners and I'm hoping we get a little bit of margin improvement with some of the adjustments of crew production coming on.\nManav Gupta: This is a very helpful sir. I had a very quick follow-up on Dapple. I think you're moving about 50,000 on Dapple to your midwest and midcon refineries but I think there are three offsets  and Mandan can you split up your Bakken bargain usage between Dapple and non-Dapple. I'm just trying to understand in case  does go down are there enough offsets to that 50,000 barrels so you actually may not see an earnings headwind on the refining side.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Manav that's accurate. So we have a bunch of other alternatives other than Dapple as far as supply. So if Dapple were to not run we think we have enough alternatives on the supply side. So I think you're right on with your statement. One comment I would say though on the logistics side with respect to Dapple as well as another pipeline up in that area the high plains pipeline, I mean MPLX is a 9% owner in Dapple and then the high plains pipeline if that were to shut down as well as a result of the recent discussions about the BIA looking to have it shut down. I'll give you a couple comments that I think would be helpful to clear in the market. Number one is we believe on the BIA that an appeal has been filed at this point which triggers an automatic stay of the shutdown. So we don't think there's anything in the short term because there is an automatic stay and then we'll continue to try and advance that discussion to a good conclusion for all parties. On Dapple obviously energy transfer is taking the lead in that discussion from the legal standpoint, etc. but both of those together if they were both to shut down on the logistics side we think the impact to us would be less than $100 million if both entities were to be down. We don't think that's the likelihood case but I just wanted to give you a little bit of the logistics side of it and then to your point on the MPC supply we think we have enough alternatives that Mandan would be supplied adequately as well as our PADD II refineries.\nManav Gupta: Thank you so much for taking my questions.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBenny Wong: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. My first one was wondering if you can provide some color or details around that 15-year supply agreement with 7-Eleven? Wondering if there's a value or you would assign to it and maybe give us a sense of the opportunities of growth in terms of areas and size there.\nMike Hennigan: So I'll give some comments and I'll let Benny add. I mentioned earlier one of the big benefits in the agreement is we maintain a lot of the integration benefit that we see as part of our portfolio. So I mentioned earlier it's about approximately 8 billion gallons for 15 years. So it's a long-term relationship that we're looking forward to with 7-Eleven and a lot of the integration benefit that we have is providing the logistics service and providing the transportation and trucking services. So we're going to continue to provide those services for 7-Eleven. So there'll be a benefit to us as far as using our logistics assets, using our trucking services, trying to give them the utmost and terrific service. So I think it's a win-win for both of us. We're going to capture the integrated value as far as the logistics and the supply and in 7-Eleven obviously we'll capture the margin in the retail business going forward. Another important point is that's 7.7 billion hold steady for the whole 15 years. So it's a very long-term relationship so that's one component and the second component is we plan to work hand in hand with 7-Eleven as they grow out their portfolio. They've had a stated goal to expand to about 20,000 stores. So we have a second agreement with them that I'll let Brian comment on which is to continue to supply them beyond the existing Speedway situation.\nBrian Partee: Yes. Thanks Mike. Yes, it's a little tricky to talk about the supply agreement commercially for obvious reasons but maybe I'd kind of underscore a couple of the guiding principles and tenants to it and hit upon what Mike already mentioned really is it's important to know we had a market-based philosophy. So it's very difficult and tricky to develop a long-term supply arrangement but we think we've done it. We think this is a really good solid relationship that's a win-win for both parties. If you think about the history of the Speedway portfolio literally growing up over decades in and around the infrastructure. So it's important to us to preserve the integration value operationally associated with that which we've done so in the contract. At the same time providing a really compelling supply operationally as well as commercially for 7-Eleven in the transaction. So we think going forward it's really set up well for both sides from a win-win perspective and then Mike from a growth perspective historically we haven't had I'd say based on their scale 7-Eleven haven't had a huge supply relationship with them. So we think there's opportunity there especially across the broader platform that we now have coast to coast to work closely together to find more opportunities. So we think we've started down the right path. We think we've got the commercial construct to get there and we're excited about the prospects of going forward once we get to the closing table to drive incremental value not only for MPC but across both sides of the table.\nBenny Wong: Great. Thanks. That's very helpful. My follow-up question, a follow-up on your decision on closing Martinez and Gallup just wanted to get your thought on the impact especially Martinez on PADD V when we get back to more of a normal environment, should we expect that region to flip to be more an important product and what you think that potentially does to the margin volatility in that region and also wanted to get a sense in terms of the change in cost structure it brings and if you think how much the price improvements from a tighter supply might bring to other assets and potentially offset the normal contributions from these assets.\nMike Hennigan: So I'll let Brian make a comment on the balance and then Ray can make a comment on the cost structure.\nBrian Partee:  Yes. As it relates to the west coast balance I think taking Martinez down is certainly directionally helpful for the balance and that's an obvious statement. Hard to predict though going forward what that actually looks like as we continue to trend out of COVID but we've been able to optimize and resupply with inter network as well as with some of our trade partners in that marketplace. So directionally positive and on the diesel side I think Ray hit on it earlier if you think about the mix of diesel production out of Martinez and what we're replacing with renewable diesel going forward, we need to go one for one but the key there is renewable diesel is the demand element in the market. So it puts us in a really good position to not be the exporter in the market to really help penetrate the market with what's being demanded out on the west coast. So hard to know with complete certainty and predict the future but obviously we feel it's very directionally favorable for the marketplace.\nRay Brooks: Hey Benny, his is Ray. I'll just talk a little bit on the cost structure. When I talked a little bit earlier about Martinez I commented that it has a very high cost structure as a refined product refinery. So that going forward we'll have a much more streamlined facility with the three hydro processing units, hydrogen plants and so forth. So we'll have a much lower cost structure on an OPEC standpoint as well as I talked earlier about the CapEx conversion. So at the end of the day we really feel that we'll have a cost advantage renewable diesel opportunity.\nBenny Wong: Great. Thank you very much everyone.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Prashant Rao with Citi Group. Your line is open.\nPrashant Rao: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the west coast there. With Martinez going down how do you think about the synergies in having sort of that coastal coverage north to south in PADD V? Does that increase or change the way the importance of or change the way that you think about Anacortes or Kenai in terms of where that fits in the portfolio and then sort of related to that too I wanted to ask a follow-up about some of the lower complexity smaller refineries in the midcon but maybe starting on that west coast synergy question and then I'll wait for the follow-ups.\nBrian Partee: Yes, Prashant. This is Brian Partee. I mean absolutely yes it's a fundamental shift not only in the west coast balance but certainly to our book. So as a result it has a direct impact on how we think about medium and long term about the assets out in the west coast. So something in the west coast system today is somewhat akin to what we're used to running in the midwest with some of the flexibility we have between the plants and this really just levers that and puts us into a different gear out west thinking about logistical assets, marine assets, terminal assets and whatnot to be able to optimize the overall portfolio. We've always run the midwest as a \u201csystem\u201dand the west coast is largely functioning in a similar manner and we see this directionally helpful to help us optimize the system overall and we believe we've got the logistical capability to do that and really feel like it puts us in a great position going forward.\nPrashant Rao: Okay. Great and then just to follow-up on some of the mid-continent broadly speaking assets the less complex refineries. You mentioned that the Dickinson conversion is on target and I think would that have kind of been in the back burner in terms of market view or what we were paying attention to and so that's it's good to get an update there but when you look at some of the other assets that are there you have a few other sort of lower complexity so to speak, smaller refining assets in the midcon. Where do you think that fits into the portfolio longer term; some of those in terms of disposal versus conversion or keeping them running as is just wanted to get some sense of your thought process around those.\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Prashant like I said a couple times here all the portfolio is going to be evaluated for what we think will be the best long term. You did mention Dickinson and I'll let Ray give an update so the market has a sense of where that stands but I think the takeaway should be we've obviously looked at several of the assets. We have we have a lot more that we're having discussion about and then hopefully like I said our goal is to get to a point where the portfolio is able to generate cash in all environments. I mean the one we're in right now is obviously very difficult but if we get back to a more normal environment we want to have a portfolio that's very resilient. So Ray you want to make a comment on Dickinson?\nRay Brooks: Yes. Hey with all the challenges that we've had with COVID, very-very pleased that we've been able to progress Dickinson right along schedule and so at this point we're still targeting before the end of the year to complete construction of 12,000 barrel day renewable diesel facility and start up and have product by the end of the year. So that's still trending very well for us.\nPrashant Rao: Okay. Thank you very much for the time.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome Prashant.\nKristina Kazarian: And with that operator thank you and thank you everyone for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarifications on topics discussed this morning our team will be available to take your calls. Thank you so much for joining us. Have a good day. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Don Templin",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning we reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.33. This adjustment reflects a $1.5 billion pre-tax lower of cost or market inventory benefit. Adjusted EBITDA was $653 million for the quarter. Cash from operations before working capital changes was a cash source of $172 million. Our dividend payments for the quarter were $378 million. Yes. Neil I guess, you asked a couple of questions, maybe let me first talk a little bit about because I think it's important around our consideration of use of proceed. Let me talk a little bit about how we think about defending our investment grade credit profile. So maybe backtrack just a month or two when we had our first quarter earnings call liquidity was probably top of mind and I think we took some very proactive actions to make sure that we had addressed that issue and as I mentioned on our comments now we have $7.7 billion or so of available liquidity. So we feel like we're well-positioned, well-situated going forward. As we think about as we look ahead, I guess that we believe that an important part of our capital structure is an appropriate level of debt. We don't think it's efficient in this environment to be under levered but we also want to make sure that we're defending our investment grade credit profile. And as I think about defending our investment grade credit profile, no one metric or factor drives that consideration. We'll look to a number of inputs that include obviously the lost EBITDA from the Speedway sale but we'll also consider the steady cash flows we have from our ownership interest in MPLX, our views around mid-cycle and through cycle EBITDA, the size of our committed credit facilities which are very significant and the cash we currently have on our balance sheet which is a billion dollars, our dividend policy going forward and various metrics such as debt to EBITDA and debt to capital but I think that all of those things will be a part of the consideration and as Mike mentioned the unprecedented macro environment makes it difficult right now to be more specific. You did ask a question about tax and so on that particular topic our tax basis and the assets that we're selling was just under $4 billion so the after tax proceeds that were showing in the release the $16.5 billion is really predicated on that tax basis. Yes Roger. In connection with sort of the effective tax rate, I mean 2020 was an unusual or is going to be an unusual year because as you look at least our book income we had significant charges related to goodwill and it has limited deductibility. So our first quarter and then year-to-date effective rate was in the sort of middle teens as a percentage really driven by that. What we spend all of our time doing is really looking hard at our cash tax position and as we disclosed in the first quarter and as we will disclose again in our second quarter 10-Q, we believe that as a result of the CARES Act we're anticipating that we will have net operating losses in 2020 given the environment and also given the significant capital expenditures that we've made in the past where we get to take the depreciation, deduction when assets are placed in service. So we expect that there will be a significant NOL and the CARES Act provides that you can carry that back up to five years and we would expect to carry back NOLs into years that -- given that five years that have a 35% tax rate. So we think that's a good thing for MPC. Our plan would be that we would work on getting our 2020 tax return filed as quickly as we could in 2021 to be able to affect that NOL carryback and the refund that would be associated with that. With respect to the sale of Speedway, obviously we will continue to evaluate that and we will look for ways to best optimize the tax position but we thought that it was appropriate for purposes of this announcement to give you that sales price minus the basis times what we believe was a normal tax rate at a relatively statutory rate."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. Yesterday we announced an agreement to sell Speedway to 7-Eleven for $21 billion in cash demonstrating our commitment to execute on the strategic priorities we outlined earlier this year. The sale of this business provides certainty around value realization for MPC shareholders. As I've stated before I believe this is a return of capital business and the substantial estimated after tax proceeds of approximately $16.5 billion enables us to both strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our shareholders. At the same time the sale also creates a long-term relationship with 7-Eleven that enhances commercial performance potential through attractive fuel supply agreements and future growth opportunities. The transaction which is subject to customary closing conditions including HSR clearance is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2021. We move on to slide 4, as a follow-up to our first quarter earnings call, we're making very difficult decisions to increase profitability, create stronger through cycle earnings and drive long-term value creation. Despite the very challenging conditions in today's market we remain committed to those goals and will continue each quarter to update the market as we progress. We outlined three areas that will be priorities towards achieving our objectives. First, strengthening the competitive position of our portfolio. We need to be a leader in cost, operating and financial performance metrics need to make necessary changes to the portfolio to achieve these objectives. One of our key philosophies is that each asset needs to generate cash back to the business. We announce the decision to indefinitely idle our Gallup and Martinez refineries. Closures as a result of the tough refining business climate ahead of us have been amplified by the impact of the pandemic. At Martinez we are evaluating repurposing the refinery towards the production of renewable diesel. Facility has the ability to provide up to 48,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel. We have the unique opportunity to take advantage of the strong set of logistics assets for the area and also have three significant processing units that are an ideal fit for making renewable diesel. These advantages should drive significantly lower capital requirements compared to greenfield investments and pursued enable initial production as early as 2022 with the option to ramp up from there. Thanks Don. I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership. We've recently published our 2019 sustainability report highlights of which can be found on slide 18 in the appendix. The report is greatly expanded this year in terms of content and disclosure and outlines our commitment to provide information consistent with the many reporting frameworks that are influential in the investment community. As such the report summarizes our comprehensive efforts related to environmental, social and governance aspects of our business. On that note I wanted to touch on recent events that have impacted many of the places where we live and work. At Marathon we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace and to partnering with organizations in the communities where we operate to encourage acceptance, tolerance and unity. Like many companies we are charting a path towards greater understanding, listening and open dialogue and we are firmly committed to continuing to make progress in this very important area. With that let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Hey Neil. Thanks for the comment. First of all before answering the question on use of proceeds let me just make a couple comments on the deal itself. First of all we looked at a lot of different structures and a lot of different options and then came to conclusion that this deal creates the most value and the most certainty for our shareholders. Hey Neil, that's a good question. Let me make one comment on the Speedway deal relative to that is we still believe we're going to get the benefit of integration. That's not loss because of the supply agreement that we have and the fact that we'll continue to be using our logistics assets but to your broader question, we still have a lot of work to do in the three areas that I keep mentioning. So strengthening the portfolio is going to continue to be a theme that you'll hear from us over time as we continue to look at our assets. We're just getting into the midst of improving our commercial performance. So you'll hear more about that over time as well. As well as the cost structure. We've given some early indications for 2020 to lower our cost structure by about $950 million but we have more work to do in that area. So you have a real good question, where do we go from here and I just ask you to keep thinking about those three priorities. We're going to continue to report on those. We're certainly not done from this standpoint. We've looked at obviously a couple of assets in that regard and obviously getting the Speedway deal done was a high priority for us. And I think it does put us in a unique position to return capital shareholders as Don mentioned to get the balance sheet in the right order. So I think we're in a good position relative to the environment that we're in and we expect that to stay challenged for some time. Although we're optimistic that just like all these cycles we'll get out of it at some point and we're seeing a slow recovery which is headed in the right direction but we're just anticipating that it could take a while to get back to normal. You are welcome, Neil. Thanks for the question. You're welcome Doug. Good morning Roger. Yes Roger. So like you said on the three initiatives, we still have a lot of work to do on the portfolio. To your point we could not be assured that we would get this deal done. We were very optimistic because we believe Speedway is a really attractive asset out there. We did get significant interest and I think we concluded the deal that's in the best interest of ourselves, Speedway and 7-Eleven. As far as the portfolio though we still have a lot more work to do both on the refining side and the logistics side and the GMP side. I mean there's a lot of activity going on and the best I can give you is over time we'll continue to disclose how we're feeling about certain things. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves in the market but we want to get to a portfolio. Our goal is to get to a portfolio that generates significant free cash in any environment and for me personally I'm a protected downside. So knowing that we're going to have these down cycles we want to make sure the portfolio is very resilient during those times. As far as the other areas like I said, we're just starting to make some moves in the commercial area and that's the one area that I'm probably going to be the least disclosing about just because of the competitive nature and then the cost structure I think just keep an eye for each quarter as we continue to progress. My personal style is not to put out a big number and then try and track against it. It's more of a try to have continuous improvement in continuing to lower our costs in a lot of different ways and change our philosophy on cost and change our philosophy on capital discipline. So each of those I think Roger, each quarter we will be able to talk a little bit about how we've made progress in each of those areas and then hopefully you'll get to see over time how we're looking to maneuver the company. I hope that makes sense to you. Good morning, Paul. Hey Paul. So when the first one, we don't have any other comments other than as I mentioned we're going to do a lot of analysis. We have some time to look at what's the best thing to do with the proceeds but I do want to leave everybody with the priorities that we have are the balance sheet and returning capital. So one of the obvious things that we stated from the beginning with Speedway was we did want to unlock that value realization and returning capital is a high priority. So I don't want to comment on anything other than those at this point. On your questions on Martinez and renewable I'm going to turn to Ray in a second but let me just give a couple opening comments. So first off I think Martinez is in a unique set of circumstances relative to the hardware that exists at the facility and I'll let Ray talk about that. We are believer that the renewable positioning is going to be beneficial to us because it aligns with California's low carbon fuel standards. We've also stated MPC has greenhouse gas reduction targets that we want to accomplish throughout the decade. So strategically this fits with where our thinking is and I would just give you a little bit of framework as we think about capital investment there and this was the harder decision. The expected capital that we're going to put in for the first phase assuming we go with this is about the same amount of capital that we would put into a planned turnaround for the facility. So we really hit a decision point and decided to pivot and look at renewable diesel production as opposed to refined product production. So that's kind of the decision tree if you want to call it that. There is a lot of details that go into the analysis. So I'm going to let Ray give you a little bit more detail so you understand some of the specifics around Martinez its own specifics about the facility. Yes Paul, it's Mike. So I don't think we have a targeted number at this point but I do want to say that we're going to continue to look at the portfolio and make decisions as we go along. Martinez -- our priority as Ray said is going to be evaluating the different phases here. The other thing I would like to add for those who know me in the past, I believe joint venture arrangements can be very successful as well when you get into these types of deals. So managing the capital and achieving a better overall outcome for all parties is something else that we're looking at very hard here. So we're evaluating that approach. In general I think at the end of the day we think there's some real uniqueness here that should be beneficial. Ray gave a lot of technical stuff. I say on the commercial side we're going to talk a little bit about JV opportunities in the future. Managing the capital is one of our main criterias we want to have strict discipline. So that's another important piece of this. So I just wanted to make that comment. And I'm also going to let Brian make a comment as well. Hey Manav it's Mike. So rick's not here today. So I'll take a shot at that. He's out of the office today. I mean in general we think directionally the crude market is going to hopefully move towards us with increased production. As you stated we're going to have a little bit of a recovery in the production side of it which hopefully will put some pressure on differentials. Right at the moment as you're very aware refining crack spreads are still very weak and it's not been a good environment for refiners but as I mentioned earlier we're optimistic but cautious as recovery continues to progress hopefully we'll get to see a recovery and then refining margins which we haven't seen yet and as crew production continues to progress to your point then hopefully we'll get to see a little bit more opening on those spreads. I would Manav this might be a good opportunity let me let Tim and Brian make a comment on where we think we are in demand recovery. So I give you a little bit of a flavor of how we're seeing the demand side. So Tim why don't you start with gasoline and then Brian can finish up with the portfolio. Yes, Manav that's accurate. So we have a bunch of other alternatives other than Dapple as far as supply. So if Dapple were to not run we think we have enough alternatives on the supply side. So I think you're right on with your statement. One comment I would say though on the logistics side with respect to Dapple as well as another pipeline up in that area the high plains pipeline, I mean MPLX is a 9% owner in Dapple and then the high plains pipeline if that were to shut down as well as a result of the recent discussions about the BIA looking to have it shut down. I'll give you a couple comments that I think would be helpful to clear in the market. Number one is we believe on the BIA that an appeal has been filed at this point which triggers an automatic stay of the shutdown. So we don't think there's anything in the short term because there is an automatic stay and then we'll continue to try and advance that discussion to a good conclusion for all parties. On Dapple obviously energy transfer is taking the lead in that discussion from the legal standpoint, etc. but both of those together if they were both to shut down on the logistics side we think the impact to us would be less than $100 million if both entities were to be down. We don't think that's the likelihood case but I just wanted to give you a little bit of the logistics side of it and then to your point on the MPC supply we think we have enough alternatives that Mandan would be supplied adequately as well as our PADD II refineries. You're welcome. So I'll give some comments and I'll let Benny add. I mentioned earlier one of the big benefits in the agreement is we maintain a lot of the integration benefit that we see as part of our portfolio. So I mentioned earlier it's about approximately 8 billion gallons for 15 years. So it's a long-term relationship that we're looking forward to with 7-Eleven and a lot of the integration benefit that we have is providing the logistics service and providing the transportation and trucking services. So we're going to continue to provide those services for 7-Eleven. So there'll be a benefit to us as far as using our logistics assets, using our trucking services, trying to give them the utmost and terrific service. So I think it's a win-win for both of us. We're going to capture the integrated value as far as the logistics and the supply and in 7-Eleven obviously we'll capture the margin in the retail business going forward. Another important point is that's 7.7 billion hold steady for the whole 15 years. So it's a very long-term relationship so that's one component and the second component is we plan to work hand in hand with 7-Eleven as they grow out their portfolio. They've had a stated goal to expand to about 20,000 stores. So we have a second agreement with them that I'll let Brian comment on which is to continue to supply them beyond the existing Speedway situation. So I'll let Brian make a comment on the balance and then Ray can make a comment on the cost structure. You're welcome. Yes. Prashant like I said a couple times here all the portfolio is going to be evaluated for what we think will be the best long term. You did mention Dickinson and I'll let Ray give an update so the market has a sense of where that stands but I think the takeaway should be we've obviously looked at several of the assets. We have we have a lot more that we're having discussion about and then hopefully like I said our goal is to get to a point where the portfolio is able to generate cash in all environments. I mean the one we're in right now is obviously very difficult but if we get back to a more normal environment we want to have a portfolio that's very resilient. So Ray you want to make a comment on Dickinson? You're welcome Prashant."

            "content": "Hey thanks, Mike. Paul, I just want to give you a framework a little bit that we've actually been looking at Martinez for a long time essentially ever since we merged with Andeavor and early on we evaluated what you suggested co-processing for renewable diesel but those economics weren't nearly as strong as the conversion that we're looking at right now. The key item and Mike just hit on this is with the refinery continuing in its current form is that it has an extremely high cost structure and then we have the near-term headwinds with a heavy turnaround spend in the coming year. So we believe that transitioning Martinez to a renewable diesel plant ultimately creates value for our shareholders and there are certain unique advantages for this site. Our Martinez renewable diesel facility can provide up to 48,000 barrels per day of capacity and we expect the initial production could be online in 2022 and ramping up from there. We are continued to evaluate in more detail but the initial analysis looks extremely promising. Martinez current complexity presents a capital efficient project for us given that there are three high pressure hydro processing units. Retrofitting these units will allow for renewable diesel production equal to about one third of the current refinery's nameplate crew capacity. There are also the existing hydrogen plants, power generation and extensive inbound and outbound logistics that are all needed to produce renewable diesel. So our intention is to pivot to the production of higher value, low carbon intensity diesel for California. Martinez produces about 54,000 barrels per day of ULSD at full utilization and the conversion would produce up to 48,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel. I want to emphasize that this is not a grassroots facility. So there is an element of speed of conversion. We believe that we have an early mover advantage and we believe that there are opportunities for meaningful partnerships with feedstock suppliers. Now we fully understand that the drivers for the economics of this project are not our typical refinery project that there are regulatory drivers but at the end of the day with the unique advantages for Martinez that I talked about earlier we're just really excited to take this evaluation further. Hey Benny, his is Ray. I'll just talk a little bit on the cost structure. When I talked a little bit earlier about Martinez I commented that it has a very high cost structure as a refined product refinery. So that going forward we'll have a much more streamlined facility with the three hydro processing units, hydrogen plants and so forth. So we'll have a much lower cost structure on an OPEC standpoint as well as I talked earlier about the CapEx conversion. So at the end of the day we really feel that we'll have a cost advantage renewable diesel opportunity. Yes. Hey with all the challenges that we've had with COVID, very-very pleased that we've been able to progress Dickinson right along schedule and so at this point we're still targeting before the end of the year to complete construction of 12,000 barrel day renewable diesel facility and start up and have product by the end of the year. So that's still trending very well for us."

            "name": "Brian Partee",
            "content": "Yes Paul. To your question the last question that you snuck in there regarding the rent as it relates to the Speedway separation just wanted to address that real quick. So I think the first thing to understand and appreciate that we've always had a market-based philosophy and approach to pricing with Speedway. So as a result of the separation fortunately due to that historical philosophy there's really no step changer movement and value shift but fundamentally MPC will be the blender of record in all transactions. So we will possess the rent and retain the rent. As it relates to the value of that rent that's all always driven by market specifics which is individual market by market and the agreement fully contemplates that. When you talk about a long-term agreement like this we have to make sure that it's resilient over time and the agreement fully contemplates this for rents or anything else frankly in the future. So that's the way it's going to be handled in agreement. So I mean just wanted to make the point underlined and underscore that there is no value shift whatsoever as a result of the transaction on rents. Yes. Thanks Tim. So to continue on demand Manav I can kind of talk across our entire book. So to Tim's point we see the exit rate for July is down about 10% to 15% overall. So I can echo what Tim's seeing that just a couple of regional notes the one I guess downside note on a regionality is in the southwest. So with the resurgence in cases of COVID in the southwest we have seen a weakening here in the last several weeks in that particular region. On the bright side the midwest and Atlantic coast both recovered and they're down roughly 7% year-on-year across in total book which is a really good sign for the Atlantic coast as everybody knows that we're pretty hard hit up in the New York, New Jersey marketplace. On the diesel side we hit our low point just as a reminder in the early to mid April. We were off about 22% year-on-year. We exited July off about 10% and to Tim's point on demand profile we have seen since the fourth of July kind of a sideways motion as it relates to demand but it's been pretty stable over that period of time but somewhat in a plateaued manner. The downside regionally the great plains is off 15% to 20% a lot of that it has to do with the heavy demands up in the Bakken area that have curtailed as a result of drilling activity up in that market and then the upside regionally midwest is about 5% off and we're actually up in the southeast year-on-year on the distillate side Closing out on jet fuel in the second quarter we are off roughly 34% year-on-year a pretty big out performance relative to the market. A lot of that has to do with our sales mix. We're heavily levered to cargo sales which are really strong resurgence really since the COVID outbreak and even before that with online retailing really driving a lot of the demand in the midwest and also up in the Alaska market. July we're actually down year-on-year in the low teens. So really strong performance by our aviation team. That's really starting to see the fruits of the combination commercially with the endeavor portfolio and MPC coast to coast. A lot of the jet buyers they're levered across not only the U.S. but just globally so really been able to create richer relationships there to drive incremental capture of market share overall. Really the outlook on August is pretty flat to July. We expect to be some downside to that based on the resurgence and in both cases stay-at-home orders as well as quarantine and really the thing we're watching right now as we look at the September is what is demand going to look like in September given that a lot of schools are not returning to normal people are working from home. So there is definitely a pent-up demand of folks wanting to move around. So it's a bit of a wild card what demand is going to look like in September. You can make as good of an upside case as a downside case. We're watching it closely. Yes. Thanks Mike. Yes, it's a little tricky to talk about the supply agreement commercially for obvious reasons but maybe I'd kind of underscore a couple of the guiding principles and tenants to it and hit upon what Mike already mentioned really is it's important to know we had a market-based philosophy. So it's very difficult and tricky to develop a long-term supply arrangement but we think we've done it. We think this is a really good solid relationship that's a win-win for both parties. If you think about the history of the Speedway portfolio literally growing up over decades in and around the infrastructure. So it's important to us to preserve the integration value operationally associated with that which we've done so in the contract. At the same time providing a really compelling supply operationally as well as commercially for 7-Eleven in the transaction. So we think going forward it's really set up well for both sides from a win-win perspective and then Mike from a growth perspective historically we haven't had I'd say based on their scale 7-Eleven haven't had a huge supply relationship with them. So we think there's opportunity there especially across the broader platform that we now have coast to coast to work closely together to find more opportunities. So we think we've started down the right path. We think we've got the commercial construct to get there and we're excited about the prospects of going forward once we get to the closing table to drive incremental value not only for MPC but across both sides of the table. Yes. As it relates to the west coast balance I think taking Martinez down is certainly directionally helpful for the balance and that's an obvious statement. Hard to predict though going forward what that actually looks like as we continue to trend out of COVID but we've been able to optimize and resupply with inter network as well as with some of our trade partners in that marketplace. So directionally positive and on the diesel side I think Ray hit on it earlier if you think about the mix of diesel production out of Martinez and what we're replacing with renewable diesel going forward, we need to go one for one but the key there is renewable diesel is the demand element in the market. So it puts us in a really good position to not be the exporter in the market to really help penetrate the market with what's being demanded out on the west coast. So hard to know with complete certainty and predict the future but obviously we feel it's very directionally favorable for the marketplace. Yes, Prashant. This is Brian Partee. I mean absolutely yes it's a fundamental shift not only in the west coast balance but certainly to our book. So as a result it has a direct impact on how we think about medium and long term about the assets out in the west coast. So something in the west coast system today is somewhat akin to what we're used to running in the midwest with some of the flexibility we have between the plants and this really just levers that and puts us into a different gear out west thinking about logistical assets, marine assets, terminal assets and whatnot to be able to optimize the overall portfolio. We've always run the midwest as a \u201csystem\u201dand the west coast is largely functioning in a similar manner and we see this directionally helpful to help us optimize the system overall and we believe we've got the logistical capability to do that and really feel like it puts us in a great position going forward."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session . Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Good morning. And welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our Web site at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Don Templin, CFO and other members of the Executive Team.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. As everyone is aware, the global pandemic became the focus in the quarter and that continues today, with our immediate priority on safely operating our assets to supply products to the market, protecting the health and safety of our employees and customers and supporting the communities in which we operate. The actions taken to prevent the spread of the virus has significantly reduced global economic activity and demand for our products, specifically towards the last month of the quarter. Our refining operating areas have been particularly hard hit in the upper Midwest and on the West Coast. At the same time, our midstream and retail businesses reported strong results, which offset some of the financial impact of lower refining demand and margins. As a result of this difficult situation, we're responding with prudent tactical changes in our business. First, reducing our total capital spend by $1.4 billion or approximately 30% to $3 billion for 2020. This includes approximately $700 million at MPC and $700 million at MPLX. This reduction is planned across all segments of the business with the remaining growth capital spend, primarily related to projects that are in progress or nearing completion. Second, we have reduced our planned operating expenses by approximately $950 million, primarily through reductions of fixed costs and deferring certain expense projects. This includes $750 million of operating expense reductions at MPC and $200 million of operating expense reductions at MPLX. Third, we've taken steps to maintain our financial flexibility. We\u2019ve secured $3.5 billion of additional liquidity, including a new $1 billion 364-day revolver and issued $2.5 billion of senior notes. After taking these actions, we have approximately $6.8 billion of undrawn availability on our credit facilities. These actions strengthen our liquidity and also strengthen the through cycle earnings power of our business. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Don to review the first quarter results in more detail. Then I'll come back and share my early focus areas as we start to implement changes at MPC going forward.\nDon Templin: Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. Earlier today, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.16. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.9 billion for the quarter. Cash from operations before working capital changes was $1.3 billion and our dividend payments for the quarter were $377 million. Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2019 to first quarter 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was down approximately $1.3 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by lower earnings in refining and marketing. Lower crack spreads due to demand destruction from the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted R&M earnings. First quarter results also included non-cash lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory, and goodwill and asset impairments totaling $12.4 billion. Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 shows the change in our midstream EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Midstream EBITDA increased $19 million versus the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by stable fee-based earnings and sustained organic growth in the base business, overcoming headwinds from declining natural gas prices in the quarter. Slide 8 provides an overview of our retail segment. First quarter EBITDA was $644 million. Retail margins were nearly $0.33 per gallon in the first quarter. These strong fuel margins were partially offset by lower fuel volumes compared to fourth quarter, reflecting demand destruction associated with COVID-19. Same store merchandise sales increased year-over-year, despite fuel demand pressures in the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of the Speedway brand. We continue to target fourth quarter 2020 for the completion of the separation of Speedway, and we are progressing separation activities. However, the separation timing could change given COVID-19 related impacts to the business environment and access to the capital markets. Slide 9 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment. Performance in this segment reflected the challenges associated with managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated shelter in place orders. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $154 million, a decrease of approximately $1.3 billion versus the fourth quarter. Margins in all regions decreased compared to fourth quarter 2019, particularly in the Midcon and West Coast regions where we saw a negative gas cracks towards the end of March. Despite these challenges, our commercial team was able to capture a favorable price realizations for both gasoline and diesel.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Don. Obviously, the current environment is required our immediate focus to ensure our through cycle resiliency of our business. But I also wanted to briefly share my view for the future. Over the past decades, this company has grown to become one of the largest energy platforms in the country. Although, MPC has been successful in many areas, there's also a strong case for change to drive increased profitability, stronger through cycle earnings and long-term value creation. There are three areas that will be our early focus to help us achieve these objectives. First, we need to strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio. This means positioning our assets to be a leader in cost, operating and financial performance metrics. MPC has always been focused on safety and operational excellence and that will not change. However, we need to focus further on the contribution of each of our individual assets and ensure that financial performance in all cycles meets our expectations and contributes to shareholder returns. Second, we need to improve our commercial performance. We are fortunate to have an extensive fortunate to having it and extensive integrated footprint. We have an opportunity to be more dynamic to capture higher margins across the value chain. Success for our refining system starts with raw material selection, it's an area of opportunity for us to further take advantage of the refining asset capability. In addition, we have the opportunity to enhance and optimize the placement of our products across both the sales channels and the geographic marketplace. Focused enhancements to both raw material selection and product placement will increase our ability to maximize value across the entire value chain, increasing the margin we deliver to the bottom-line. And third, we need to lower our overall cost structure and be extremely disciplined in capital allocation. This means lowering our cost in all aspects of our business and challenging ourselves to be incredibly disciplined in every expense dollar we spend across our organization.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up. If time permits, we will re prompt for additional questions. We will now open the lines for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session . Our first question comes from Neil Mehta. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Mike, good morning team. And my congratulations on the new role as CEO. My kick off question here is on the cost savings and the capital reductions that you announced. Can you put some more meat on the bones behind key line items that drove those reductions? And how should we think about whether cost and capital reductions are cyclical in response to the environment versus structurally more capital efficient approach you\u2019re taking to running the business?\nMike Hennigan:\nDon Templin: As you'll recall when we rolled out our budget for 2020, our refining and marketing budget was $1.55 billion that included $450 million of maintenance capital. So it essentially included $1.1 billion of growth capital. And when we talked about our plan originally for 2020, about 60% of that growth capital was really attributable to two primary projects; one was the continuation of the STAR Program, which we\u2019ll run into next year 2021, so that's at Galveston Bay; and the other was the Dickinson renewable diesel project, which will complete this year. So if you think about 60% of our $600 million basically of capital, of the growth capital was those two projects, one will be completely done and the other will be in sort of a tapering mode and nearing completion. You'll see that we'll have a lot of flexibility around our capital budget next year.\nMike Hennigan: I'm going to add a little bit to the expense side. So again, back to your question, how much is variable versus structural. Obviously, with the pandemic and us reducing refining rates back to minimum, there's a portion of variable costs there. But out of the $750 million of expense reduction on the MPC side, majority of that is fixed costs that we expect to maintain at a lower level, about $500 million of it being fixed. And I'm going to let Ray kind of comment on that in that area, and then partially part of it is variable. On the midstream side, about $200 million of it mostly we said was deferred expense projects. So right now they fit in the deferred column. But as we look at that further, we're going to take a look at whether they need to be deferred or whether they actually are part of our long term plan. So let me let Ray add a little bit of color to the refining fixed costs situation.\nRay Brooks: On the fixed costs and refining, there's really three components that make that up. The first would be the turnaround segment just lower overall turnaround expenses for the year with some deferral out of 2020. And then the other categories are lower maintenance costs and expense projects, just choosing to do less work, less projects at our refineries.\nMike Hennigan: Does that answer your question, Neil?\nNeil Mehta: Yes, very clear with lot of good color there. The follow up is just on Speedway. Mike, can you just talk about from your perspective as the new CEO. How strongly you believe in the strategic merit of the Speedway spin off or sale? Whether you're still targeting the fourth quarter, which you indicated in the press release and just any strategic updates around the execution of the sale, which for many investors is an important catalyst for the stock?\nMike Hennigan: So I do believe the separation is the best value proposition for MPC shareholders. So what we said in our remarks is we are still on schedule. And the expectation that we had guided before was completion in the fourth quarter, I'd say we're still scheduling and on target to accomplish that. So strategically, I still believe the separation is the best value enhancement for MPC shareholders. The only caveat that we put out here obviously is the COVID-19 situation is still very fluid and we'll have to see how that plays out as far as recovery in the business. And then the capital market access is another important part of executing that separation in a highly efficient manner. So with those two caveats, we are still committed to separation and we\u2019re continuing on the schedule. However, we just want to be cognizant of the current environment that could implement the timing a little bit, but we'll have to see how that plays out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Legate. Your line is open.\nDoug Legate: Mike, let me add my congratulations to your new role. Looking forward to seeing what you do next. In that regard, I wonder if I could just pick off on one of your comments you made on the call about the key steps you're taking. And maybe ask a bit of a leading question. Where do you see the weak links in the remaining portfolio post Speedway? What are the areas you think need to be addressed to achieve your objectives?\nMike Hennigan: Doug, I'm not ready to disclose the term weak links. What I will tell you though is we're going to do a comprehensive look at all of our assets. And overtime, you're going to see us come out with disclosures as to where we feel we are from a competitive position on each of the assets. As I mentioned earlier to Neil's question, I'm a big believer in looking at long-term value of the assets. I'm a big believer in managing to free cash flow on an individual asset basis, so that the overall portfolio is generating cash. I mean as you're very aware, this is a lot to a large extent a return of capital business and I think we've done a good job of that in the past. And I think there's just an opportunity to do a little better in there if we really look at the portfolio. So I do think I hope to takeaway is we are going to spend a lot of time on the portfolio of all the assets. We're going to look at where we can improve the competitiveness of those assets, either from a cost standpoint or commercial standpoint, that's going to be a very high focus. So, I'm hoping to leave you with those three items that each asset in the portfolio is going to be examined our overall commercial approach. And we started in that discussion already is going to be discuss quite a bit. And then lastly, we're just going to lower the cost structure of the company. We think there's an opportunity to do that at this point and we're going to get after that as quickly as we can.\nDoug Legate: Presumably that means asset rationalization is on the table, Mike?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, I think so, Doug. As I said, all the assets that we have in the portfolio are going to be examined. But yes, I think so. And I previously mentioned in the midstream space that we don't want in eight basins that's still a true statement. However, the gas business is now going through a little bit of a change. But yes, it applies to all the other assets that we have in the portfolio, whether the retail assets in the short term or the refining assets as well. So yes, a real good examination of the competitiveness of our portfolio is the first priority.\nDoug Legate: My follow up is, I was going to ask you about the dividend, but you talked about return of cash to business and so I\u2019ll leave that for someone else. What I would like to ask you guys is you\u2019re in a unique position to monitor demand trends, couple of your competitors obviously have talked about I would call it green shoots coming out of April. I'm just wondering what you can share with us in terms of how you see things evolving in your markets. And I guess more importantly, the 65% utilization guided for the next quarter. How would you respond? How quickly would you like to step up your activity before you feel comfortable enough I guess, with the demand recovery is really underway. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: So I'll start off on the high level macro. Obviously, there's a lot of optimism towards recovery. At a very high macro level, fiscal policy from the administration towards stimulus packages are being implemented, monetary policies at low rates, oil prices are at low rates for consumers. So there's a lot of optimism and recovery. My caution however, is we are currently in an oversupplied market. This has been a demand driven event, both globally and in the U. S. We've been particularly hard hit in our view in the upper Midwest and in even more particularly on the West Coast. So we're optimistic that we're starting to see that recovery. We'll have some comments -- I'll let Tim comment on specifically at the gasoline level as far as our same store sales to sort of give you a little bit more color there. And and then I'll let Brian give you a little color overall on the diesel market as well. So I'd say overall, optimistically that we're seeing good signs of recovery, but we still got a long way to go that we're still over supplied on pretty much crude and products across the board. So there's a lot of inventory that needs to work off. As far as when do you respond? Obviously, the market will tell us that. So it's a demand driven event. And when the demand is sufficient for us to change our strategy we'll do that. But for right now, we're staying at minimum rates. So let me let Tim comment a little bit about what we're seeing at Speedway.\nTim Griffith: Doug, at the retail level as a lot of the stay at home orders got put in place in sort of the middle and late part of March. We saw gas demand, which bottomed probably even more than 50% down. I mean, that was in sort of late March and early April. We've seen steady recovery since mid-April with 5% to 15% improvement, really dependent upon the region off of the lows. The weekly data that we're seeing in terms of sales are supportive of that trend so far. And we expect to see continued improvement as more of the states continue or start the reopening protocols over the next couple of months. I mean, the timing of a complete recovery is uncertain. It's really a function of how quickly these stay at home orders are removed and how quickly the consumer gets back out on the road. Obviously, we've got a lot of businesses where people continue to work from home and they may continue through this month but we'll watch that activity. We've certainly seen a nice creep in demand and expect that's going to continue. But we've got to get the commuters back on the roads rather they're commuting to work, rather they're taking kids to school, which we may not see until the fall, rather they're driving to locations for vacation or else wise. We've got to get consumer back on the road and hopefully get some signs of recovery. So we're seeing some nice signs but there's probably a few months before we can really give a better sense for exactly how this is going to play out. But we're definitely off the lows and seeing some nice improvement.\nBrian Partee: Doug, this is Brian. Just to kind of reiterate a little bit on the gasoline side and builds off of what Tim said. We have seen really the profile of the decline. It was really the last two weeks of March, where we really seem to clip off really fast really across all geographies. You hit the bottom of the market we look week on week sales, we think this is the most relevant data points in the short-term. So the week of April 6th was really what we're calling kind of the bottom of the market. And over the last three weeks, we've seen steady week on week growth. So we see that there's an optimistic trend for some of the reasons Mike indicated earlier, some of the drivers to that. So this week is starting off solid as well. But measured optimism, this is an unprecedented event. Not exactly sure what the profile of recovery looks like. We're seeing positive trends. On the distillate side, similarly we hit the bottom of the market in the week of four and six. Very modest recovery though since then, it's been less impacted. Overall EIA call on distillate demand has been somewhat declines, it\u2019s been somewhere in the 20% to 25%. We have not seen that across our whole book. We're off more in the 15% range currently year-on-year. Part of that is due to gearing. We're not really exposed to PADD 1. So there's been, with some of the corona depths of impact in PADD 1, we're not really exposed to that the way maybe others are. So we're up more than 50%. Recovery on the distillate side is really going to be tied to the broader economy. Traditionally, diesel demand has been driven by the health of the economy. And we believe that's going to be the case and coming out of this is, we're going to be watching economic indicators. We think that will drive the recovery on the distillate side.\nDoug Legate: That\u2019s very thorough guys. Thanks. May I just add Mike that Kristina and her team have done a great job helping us navigate this. So thanks to here, thanks to Don for getting on the phone with us when your 8-K came out. So appreciate all your help.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Manav Gupta. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: I have a question questions, bit of a demand question on the jet fuel side of the equation. We are seeing jet fuel demand, which is very low and refined trying to compensate by blending jet mode in the diesel and that is causing the diesel inventories to move out a little. I'm trying to understand how MPC kind of work around this entire jet fuel situation. And is there something that can be done with you don't blend jet fuel into the diesel causing the diesel inventory to move out?\nMike Hennigan: And I'm going to let Ray give you some specifics there. But I would add one comment to your question and kind of what Doug was asking as well is, I think there is some belief and we have this belief that there could be slower recovery back into the jet world. But that may also be a little bit of a boost to gasoline recovery, as consumers kind of stay more towards vehicles as opposed to airplanes, as the recovery starts to happen. I think that's a phenomenon that we're going to see a little bit. But let me let Ray give you some specifics on jet and diesel.\nRay Brooks: Manav, with regards to jet fuel, we have a lot of capabilities to blend that into the diesel pool and have done so in cases where we have high sulfur jet fuel we have the ability with the excess hydro treating capacity with the slowdowns to hydrotreat that into ultralow sulfur diesel. I guess the thing I really like to communicate is it's been very fluid as far as whether distillates strong initially distillate products. And so we had the ability to put everything into the distillate pool and we really stretched the distillate pool now. We're seeing into strengthening gasoline. We're reworking those swing streams and pushing some back to gasoline. We've communicated in the past that our swing between gasoline and distillate is about in the 10% range and we've been actually exercising every bit of that during the pandemic.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: I want to add my congratulation. Couple of questions. First on the commercial improvement. If we look back say 20 years ago from the commercial side. So when you're looking at what you know about the market that maybe a while ago and how Marathon has been doing. Is there any area that you think, okay, maybe that I can change on the best practice? In other words, what is the overall -- and also do you need to relocate your operation for the commercial to be closer to maybe either Houston or that some of the commercial hub? And do you need beef up in your talent, external talent on that operation? That's the first question.\nMike Hennigan: First of all, I mean you hit it on the head. My personal background is more in the commercial area in the financial area. So it's an area where I'm going to spend a lot of my early time here. I don't want to give any real specifics. But to your second question, though, we do plan to have a bigger presence in Houston that\u2019s something that\u2019s on our list of things that we want to accomplish. We have not had that in the past. So Rick and his team are moving towards that. They've already had some stuff down in the Texas area. So I think you're going to see us over time you know develop much more of a presence down in that area. I'm a believer that the Houston market is the center of the oil markets in the U. S. just like New York is the center of the financial market. So having a Houston presence, I think is really important for us. As far as talent overall, it's another area that I think we're going to spend quite a bit of time, looking at where we can improve some of our talent across that area. So I guess, the good news and the bad news for my commercial team is I have a lot of background in this area. I have a lot of strong thoughts and how to approach things. So, there's going to be a good collaborative discussion about how to go about it. And I will tell you we started in that already. The immediate focus of what's happening with the markets as a result of COVID has forced a lot of discussion here. So, again due to the the competitive nature of it, Paul, I can't get into a lot of specifics here. But I can tell you as I stated earlier, it's one of my main three areas that we're going to spend a lot of time on.\nPaul Cheng: Maybe can I just ask that, do you think historical data, the team is good but perhaps that they're a bit too conservative in their barometer how they look at things and not changing as maybe rapidly as the market conditions change?\nMike Hennigan: I've taken a second here to see what you were thinking there, Paul. I mean, there's some areas where I think we could be too conservative, there's other areas where there's different types of opportunities. I don't really think of it overall in that regard. I think of it more in how we approach the market, how we go about crude selection, how we use different things. I mean, we recently just saw pretty strong crude market contango and how to take advantage of that as an example, is some of the discussions that we've had recently. So I don't know if I\u2019d use your term as the catch all for what we're doing. I think of it more as looking at what our assets do, how we position ourselves commercially, looking at how the markets are responding, where product placement is best suited. So I think having maybe a little bit more quick flexibility and reacting to markets quickly, if you're using that term to be conservative then maybe I agree with that from that perspective. But I just think, I use the word being more dynamic, more flexible, more able to adapt to market conditions quicker. And then overall, just having much more focus on what we're doing commercially to support the assets that we have in place. And I will tell you, one of the things that as a result of this COVID situation. We were having daily meetings on what was occurring in the marketplace and how we should be responding to that. And that's just one example of what the new environment will be going forward.\nPaul Cheng: And the second question just for Don. Don, on the working capital management. If we looked at your two major competitors Phillips 66 and Valero, they\u2019ve been in the same similar situation and Valero\u2019s refinning operation in probably pretty similar size to yours but that the negative impact at least for this quarter on the cash flow from working capital is substantially less, roughly one is about half and the other one is far less than half of your impact. So can you maybe elaborate a little bit in terms of how perhaps that you guys manage differently than your peers if that's any different? Or is there any room for improvement so that we will be able to perhaps minimize the working capital swing a bit more?\nDon Templin: I mean, I guess the working capital changes are really a function for us three primary things, our accounts receivable, our inventory position and then our accounts payable position. And there's lots of sort of moving pieces that impact each of those three components. What I did try to do was to give you a rule of thumb, so that you all could model changes in our business. I don't have sort of particular insight into what the amount of crude volume is in our competitor\u2019s payables and what the amount of refined products sales are in their receivables. But what I can tell you for us during the quarter accounts receivable went down for the first quarter, went down about $1.9 billion. So that was a source of cash for us receivables went down. Accounts payable went down about $2.5 billion in the quarter and that was obviously a use of cash. And then our inventories, because we're trying to manage inventory appropriately and to capture contango in the market and those types of things, our inventories were up about $400 million. So the combination of sort of $1.9 billion on the accounts receivable side and then the inventory and AP move had a negative working capital impact of about $2 billion. We are also seeing some of that and I think we've articulated, we would have seen some of that continue in April where we started buying less crude volume. So to support 3 million barrel a day system in the first quarter, we're basically now supporting 2 million barrel a day system. So in April, you would have seen crude purchases going down from a volume perspective. But as we start to ramp up, you should see the inverse of that. We will be moving upwards. We\u2019ll be buying more crude. And at least recently crude prices have started to increase as well. So that should also have a favorable impact on working capital.\nPaul Cheng: Just a quick side question. With the new CEO, is there any plan to look at the accounting policy for turnaround in the expenses to capitalize it?\nDon Templin: Mike is shaking his head. I mean, we've looked at that. I guess what we wanted to do you know, Paul, is we did provide going back about a year now. We did try to provide information that was pulling out the turnaround cost, so that you could look at sort of our adjusted EBITDA on a comparable or like to like basis. But some of our peers still actually expensed it and some of our peers obviously capitalize it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: I guess I'd like to get into a little bit of maybe the forward looking side, the refining restarts, particularly obviously Martinez and Gallup. As we think about the OpEx and the CapEx guidance. Is that built in there for say Q3 restart or should we presume that that's out until '21? And then what happened  CapEx, OpEx side though?\nMike Hennigan: I'll start off and then I'll turn it over to Ray. One of the things that I think everybody realizes is the different regions have been hit harder or less to some extent depending on where you are. I mean, we've been particularly hard hit on the West Coast. If you're looking at our guidance, we're at minimum across the system. But in the West Coast system, we're running at about 50% of capacity as opposed to the roughly 66-67-ish overall. So the West Coast demand drop was even more severe than I'll say the whole national average, which led us to take more action on the West Coast specifically in that area. So let me turn over to Ray to give you a little more color on both Gallup and Martinez.\nRay Brooks: Roger, as far as Gallup and Martinez, your question as far as the guidance, does it take into account the cost of Gallup and Martinez. And the short answer is yes that it does. We chose to idle our two higher cost refineries and make up that production and resupply with lower cost facilities and all the cash impacts variable and fixed are taking into account in that.\nRoger Read: Yes, I understand in terms of the Q2 guidance. I guess I was just curious on a full year restart of those units. Is that also included or does the guidance presume that those assets are offline for all of 2020? That's what I was kind of getting at. In other words, we are seeing a recovery off of coronavirus. And as we look to the latter part of the year, the expectation would be we get very close to kind of normal levels. At least enough, I would think gets both those units back online. So I was just curious, is that included in the guidance? And then I had one follow up question.\nMike Hennigan: So we stated that those assets are idled on a temporary basis, and we'll have to see when the market requires them to come back online. I think the question you were asking though is, we don't see significant costs at all to bring those back up. I mean, Ray has them on hot standby, so I'll let him comment on that. So we are prepared to bring those back online when the demand in the market have requires it. We just in the short-term have seen some recovery, as Tim and Brian had alluded to earlier. But we still have a ways to go before we would be needing that asset, so to speak.\nRay Brooks: Roger, taking both those refineries down, Gallup and Martinez, it's not dissimilar from a hurricane standpoint when we take one of our refineries down. We take them down sequentially. We keep the utility systems going. We keep there are still operators and maintenance personnel looking after the equipment. So we would see a restart being fairly easy done within the time period of about a week and not a significant cost impact.\nRoger Read: Okay, great. Thanks. That's helpful.\nDon Templin: Roger, this is Don, sort of one other point. Achieving those capital cuts and those operating expense cuts does not require those refineries to be idle for the rest of the year. I think that was maybe the way you were asking the question. I mean, we assume that those will come back online. And so our OpEx numbers and our CapEx numbers assume we're operating at more normal levels as the year progresses.\nRoger Read: I was just trying to understand within the OpEx cut guidance, obviously, the CapEx cut guidance and the other parts. And then maybe flipping back to the kind of strategic question a lot of guys have tried to get out here on the call. Mike, as you look at the company. Do you expect to do or you already doing like a large sort of call it a benchmarking survey of everything that Marathon does or doesn't do and how well it does or doesn't do it at all as you think about the 2021 and on version of Marathon, presumably separated from retail as I think we all expect?\nMike Hennigan: Roger, so we started in that analysis and obviously, I've been part of the Marathon team for a while here, so I have my own initial thoughts. The only caveat I would give you though is in the 45 days or so that I've had to home, most of our time and most of the whole senior team\u2019s time has been dedicated to the near-term situation. So hopefully, we'll get back to normal in the health situation as far as the country and also as far as the economy and get back to normal. But we started into the process. But I would also tell you that a lot of the time recently has been dedicated to the near in situation. So started more to come and I hope to disclose more as time goes by. But I don't want to kid you that the opportunity has been limited, because of the near-term situation and our focus on trying to respond to the pandemic.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh. Your line is open.\nPhil Gresh: My first question just on the balance sheet. Don, you talked about the target of having investment grade credit rating. Obviously, the rating agencies have put out some of their own metrics that they're looking at. We have the Speedway spin off here that is still planned. And I'm just wondering about how that spin off. And the distribution you might get from that spin off would help you achieve the investment grade rating long-term are or not cheap and maintain it, long term in light of the downturn going through. And more broadly, are there other levers do you think you can pull to ensure that you maintain it through this down cycle? Thanks.\nDon Templin: Phil, I guess I wanted to recommit to. We want to defend our investment grade credit profile, and we'll continue to defend that. I think Mike mentioned in the discussions around Speedway, one of the important things around the timing of the Speedway separation is our ability to capitalize Speedway and to be able to have a balance sheet at Speedway that allows them to take on some leverage. And that leverage will then result in cash at Speedway, which will be distributed back up to MPC. And when they distribute that cash back up to MPC, we would expect that distribution would be on a tax free basis and we would expect that we would be utilizing all of that cash to manage the balance sheet. It would either be putting cash on the balance sheet to sort of support our core liquidity position. So historically we've maintained about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet in addition to the revolving credit facilities that we've had. And I think we articulated when we announced the Speedway separation that we thought that requirement would probably be closer to $2 billion versus $1 billion. We'll obviously relook at sort of core liquidity in total, given all the events that have transpired over the last 30-days to make sure, or 45 days to make sure that we're fully evaluating downside risk to the company. And then the incremental amounts would be used to pay down debt. It's one of the reasons why we had some debt maturities. We have $650 million of debt maturity at the end of this year in December, and we have $1 billion of MPC debt maturity in the first quarter of 2021. And we were planning on having that debt mature, and didn't try to extend it previously, because we wanted the capability to be able to pay off debt at MPC without incurring any incremental costs to do that. So the timing of those maturities was really aligned with or coincident with Speedway transaction. We did go out into the market at the end of April and issued senior notes. Once again, we were very focused on shorter tenor notes, so three years and five years. There was some demand for 10 years but we didn't really want to get into the 10 year market. That felt like that was structural debt. We wanted to put on -- we're basically, if you will, allowing ourselves the flexibility to have shorter term debt, allows us to pay it off and allows us to manage our balance sheet without incurring significant incremental costs.\nPhil Gresh: I guess just the follow up would be, just as I was referencing other levers that you might be able to pull and just to continue to lower debt balances, whether it's at the parent level or at a consolidated level. So how do you generally think about the distributions, whether it's the MPC dividend, the MPLX distributions and the priority of maintaining lower leverage moving forward, particularly if we're going to lose 1.5 billion EBITDA from Speedway? Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: On dividend policy, first off as you know, it's a board decision. And we had some very robust discussion about it. We think about this in the long-term and how do we see the business, you know as far as mid cycle earnings and how we see the business in the long-term. We obviously decided we wouldn't want to make a major change in return of capital on what hopefully is a very short-term issue. So our discussion led to our highest priority was defending liquidity, as Don said, and defending our investment grade rating that was very important to us. And I would just comment that we went into this event, if you want to call it that, with a little under $7 billion of liquidity. And now we've taken the working capital pain with a reduction in crude price, et cetera. And as Don stated in his remarks, we're sitting here at about that very same level. So we still have a lot of liquidity going forward. As far as recovery in the business, hopefully, it'll be sooner rather than later. I think you're hearing from our team, there's cautious optimism that we could be coming back. Yet at the same time, as Tim mentioned, we're still pretty far down year-on-year on gasoline demand, but we'll have to see how that recovers. But overall, our return of capital is something that we obviously think is really important. I mentioned earlier, I think this is to a large extent refining is a return of capital business. So we'll have a lot of discussion with the board as to how that plays out going forward.\nDon Templin: Phil, I might also add, this is Don, on the working capital side. Given sort of the low volumes that were, or the low utilization rates we\u2019re at and the lower crude prices, it is really I call it asymmetric opportunity now. We would expect that working capital will be a source of cash going forward as prices improve and as volumes pick up as opposed to the significant use of cash over the last 60 days.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Prashant Rao.\nPrashant Rao: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And Mike, congratulations and appreciate everything you outlined at the beginning there in terms of the three areas of early focus very helpful. Mike, my question is on really return on invested capital expectations here. First, on the remaining 2020 investments after these tax reductions. Is it fair to assume that these are probably toward the higher end of the range of clearing hurdle rates or on NPV basis versus what you've deferred? That's sort of more of a housekeeping question, I suppose. But bigger picture then the second question. Given this macro shock the potential for strategic value realization at Marathon's overall portfolio as you\u2019ve outlined in your earlier is a focus here. Could you help us out with your thoughts on hurdle rates for capital projects? How they change going forward at all? And how that might be -- you're talking about every dollar earning its return that's invested. I wanted to think about that in terms of the various end markets that you're in, the segments and what that means for thinking about maybe putting higher hurdle rates on certain types of projects or in certain end market exposures.\nMike Hennigan: Prashant, I think the easy answer to your first question is yes. And then to your second point, the approach that I believe is especially in this type of business which is very volatile and when you invest capital, you're investing for a very long time. So I think using the word strict discipline is the best way to describe it. I stress test in general how do we think about investing capital if X occurs or if Y occurs. And my own personal bias is, because this refining business is very cyclical and there are downturns, you got to make sure that you're still getting a good return, even if you're having a down cycle so to speak. So overall, I think without giving you a specific number, we will be stress testing or in your terms, raising the hurdle rate to make sure that the investment that we do is very long lasting and is going to guarantee us a good return. So in general, that will translate to a higher hurdle. Yes, without giving you a number, I would say, yes, that's correct. And I think you're going to see us have a lot more robust discussion on the strategic nature of where we invest and guaranteeing ourselves that it is long-term investment and convincing ourselves that it's a good use of capital. I mean at the end of the day, we're stewards of the shareholders\u2019 capital and that's one of the most important things we can control. I mean, in our business and I know you guys often ask a lot of questions about our views on things that we don't control, and we're happy to give you our views. But I try to spend a lot more time on the things we do control. And obviously have an opinion of things that we don't control as far as market conditions, et cetera, et cetera. But really spend as much time as we can on the things that we actually control and having discipline about how we spend that money, whether it's organic capital, whether it's M&A, whether it's expense dollars et cetera, et cetera. I think all those deserve a lot of attention and that's part of what we will focus going forward on.\nPrashant Rao: And my quick follow up it\u2019s really on the improving gasoline cracks that we're seeing on the screen and sort of sequential I guess I\u2019d use the term measured optimism, I like that on the product demand side. Just for our purposes to help understand, given lower -- the low utilization rates and also crude differential volatility. What are the impacts that is kind of unprecedented here, but is capture impacted, should we be thinking about some maybe of taking a grain of salt in terms of dislocations versus what you're able to capture on a realized basis versus what we're seeing on the screen, either way either that you ever capture. But just sort of trying to reconcile that, because we all kind of have an idea of what we do in more normal times, but these are obviously sort of three sigma type of period we're in right now. So just wanted to sort of get your thoughts around that.\nMike Hennigan: I'll give a couple thoughts. One is we did the term of cautious optimism that we\u2019re seeing some recovery. But I also try and balance that with the overall inventories we still have, I don't know what the exact number is. Dave can jump in. Maybe 30 million barrels of light products, gasoline and distillates that are over the long-term average. We're still sitting on roughly 50 million barrels of crude over that same long-term average. So even though I think we're seeing demand start to recover, I still think we have ways to go to get back to some closer to normal inventory levels and normal demand levels. So, I think that's just going to play itself out. Again, that falls into the category of something we don't control. We'll try and keep an eye on the demand. We do have some insights from our marketing view and we'll try and match the supply of our products into those demands. And then we're always going to try and be opportunistic to find the best market or the best region to optimize our system.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Brad Heffern. Your line is open.\nBrad Heffern: I guess that was a good segue into asking about another thing that you can't control. So I'm curious about just the inland differentials that we're seeing now. Obviously, in late-March and early April, we saw these very wide differentials. Now as the shut-ins have started to increase, we're seeing relatively narrow differentials, especially for WCS. So can you give your outlook on that? And any thoughts about how sustainable it is if sort of inland cracks aren't increasing at the same time? Thanks.\nRick Hessling: On inland differentials, you\u2019re spot on. We have seen incredible volatility, literally from one end of the spectrum to the other. Right now, what you're seeing in the marketplace is you're seeing the free market work. You're seeing North American producers and specifically U. S. producers, Canadian producers, self regulating, if you will and it's affecting the differentials. However, they've come in and they swung the other way here in the last three, four weeks versus blowing out 30 days ago. I think the offset honestly will be as the states come out of shut-ins and demand increases, you'll see some more volatility there. So predicting where they go is difficult, a lot of it is demand driven, a lot of it is producer cut driven. So, I would tell you though, when you look at the mid-cons specifically, Brad, it's very tight inventories at Cushing are extremely high as that\u2019s well publicized, almost at maximum. So I think, you're going to continue to see incredible volatility in the mid-con, which we will be able to take advantage of.\nBrad Heffern: And then as my follow up, just a question about the asphalt market. So typically when we have flat price this low, asphalt is a much greater contributor to profitability than it would normally be. Is that the case right now? And can you talk about how the demand side looks? Obviously, we have these COVID impacts, but I would imagine maybe some governments are taking advantage of this to do more road repairs than they normally would? Thanks.\nBrian Partee: So currently asphalt, if you look at the inventories, we've been towards the higher side on the inventories. Part of that had to do with coming out of IMO in the first quarter. But the work log is out there. We're seeing the demand starting to pick up as we head into the season here. I don't know that asphalt has an outsize contribution at this point relative to overall contribution. We have seen steady, the benchmark we look at when we think about the asphalt market is, asphalt prices relative to TI and we've been selling over TI consistently, which is fairly typical with down market. So from a pricing standpoint, we're happy with where things are at. The work is starting to pick up. The watch out or focus really on the asphalt demand is going to be really taxes and access to funding at the local levels and cut in discretionary spending. And it's uncertain whether we see that or not, that\u2019s unfolding as we speak. But working with our customers, the backlog is there, they're ready to go to work, we're starting to see it pick up. So, I guess it falls into the measured optimism similar to what I said on the distillate side of things. But that's kind of where we sit today on the asphalt market.\nKristina Kazarian: Great. And with that, we'll end our call today. So thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed this morning, our team will be available to take your call. Thank you again for joining us. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Ray Brooks",
            "content": "On the fixed costs and refining, there's really three components that make that up. The first would be the turnaround segment just lower overall turnaround expenses for the year with some deferral out of 2020. And then the other categories are lower maintenance costs and expense projects, just choosing to do less work, less projects at our refineries. Manav, with regards to jet fuel, we have a lot of capabilities to blend that into the diesel pool and have done so in cases where we have high sulfur jet fuel we have the ability with the excess hydro treating capacity with the slowdowns to hydrotreat that into ultralow sulfur diesel. I guess the thing I really like to communicate is it's been very fluid as far as whether distillates strong initially distillate products.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Brian Partee",
            "content": "Doug, this is Brian. Just to kind of reiterate a little bit on the gasoline side and builds off of what Tim said. We have seen really the profile of the decline. It was really the last two weeks of March, where we really seem to clip off really fast really across all geographies. You hit the bottom of the market we look week on week sales, we think this is the most relevant data points in the short-term. So the week of April 6th was really what we're calling kind of the bottom of the market. And over the last three weeks, we've seen steady week on week growth. So we see that there's an optimistic trend for some of the reasons Mike indicated earlier, some of the drivers to that. So this week is starting off solid as well. But measured optimism, this is an unprecedented event. Not exactly sure what the profile of recovery looks like. We're seeing positive trends. On the distillate side, similarly we hit the bottom of the market in the week of four and six. Very modest recovery though since then, it's been less impacted. Overall EIA call on distillate demand has been somewhat declines, it's been somewhere in the 20% to 25%. We have not seen that across our whole book. We're off more in the 15% range currently year-on-year. Part of that is due to gearing. We're not really exposed to PADD 1. So there's been, with some of the corona depths of impact in PADD 1, we're not really exposed to that the way maybe others are. So we're up more than 50%. Recovery on the distillate side is really going to be tied to the broader economy. Traditionally, diesel demand has been driven by the health of the economy. And we believe that's going to be the case and coming out of this is, we're going to be watching economic indicators. We think that will drive the recovery on the distillate side. So currently asphalt, if you look at the inventories, we've been towards the higher side on the inventories. Part of that had to do with coming out of IMO in the first quarter. But the work log is out there. We're seeing the demand starting to pick up as we head into the season here. I don't know that asphalt has an outsize contribution at this point relative to overall contribution. We have seen steady, the benchmark we look at when we think about the asphalt market is, asphalt prices relative to TI and we've been selling over TI consistently, which is fairly typical with down market. So from a pricing standpoint, we're happy with where things are at. The work is starting to pick up. The watch out or focus really on the asphalt demand is going to be really taxes and access to funding at the local levels and cut in discretionary spending. And it's uncertain whether we see that or not, that's unfolding as we speak. But working with our customers, the backlog is there, they're ready to go to work, we're starting to see it pick up. So, I guess it falls into the measured optimism similar to what I said on the distillate side of things. But that's kind of where we sit today on the asphalt market."

            "content": "Doug, at the retail level as a lot of the stay at home orders got put in place in sort of the middle and late part of March. We saw gas demand, which bottomed probably even more than 50% down. I mean, that was in sort of late March and early April. We've seen steady recovery since mid-April with 5% to 15% improvement, really dependent upon the region off of the lows. The weekly data that we're seeing in terms of sales are supportive of that trend so far. And we expect to see continued improvement as more of the states continue or start the reopening protocols over the next couple of months. I mean, the timing of a complete recovery is uncertain. It's really a function of how quickly these stay at home orders are removed and how quickly the consumer gets back out on the road. Obviously, we've got a lot of businesses where people continue to work from home and they may continue through this month but we'll watch that activity. We've certainly seen a nice creep in demand and expect that's going to continue. But we've got to get the commuters back on the roads rather they're commuting to work, rather they're taking kids to school, which we may not see until the fall, rather they're driving to locations for vacation or else wise. We've got to get consumer back on the road and hopefully get some signs of recovery. So we're seeing some nice signs but there's probably a few months before we can really give a better sense for exactly how this is going to play out. But we're definitely off the lows and seeing some nice improvement."

            "content": "On inland differentials, you're spot on. We have seen incredible volatility, literally from one end of the spectrum to the other. Right now, what you're seeing in the marketplace is you're seeing the free market work. You're seeing North American producers and specifically U. S. producers, Canadian producers, self regulating, if you will and it's affecting the differentials. However, they've come in and they swung the other way here in the last three, four weeks versus blowing out 30 days ago. I think the offset honestly will be as the states come out of shut-ins and demand increases, you'll see some more volatility there. So predicting where they go is difficult, a lot of it is demand driven, a lot of it is producer cut driven. So, I would tell you though, when you look at the mid-cons specifically, Brad, it's very tight inventories at Cushing are extremely high as that's well publicized, almost at maximum. So I think, you're going to continue to see incredible volatility in the mid-con, which we will be able to take advantage of."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. Earlier today, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.16. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.9 billion for the quarter. Cash from operations before working capital changes was $1.3 billion and our dividend payments for the quarter were $377 million. Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2019 to first quarter 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was down approximately $1.3 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by lower earnings in refining and marketing. Lower crack spreads due to demand destruction from the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted R&M earnings. First quarter results also included non-cash lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory, and goodwill and asset impairments totaling $12.4 billion. Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 shows the change in our midstream EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Midstream EBITDA increased $19 million versus the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by stable fee-based earnings and sustained organic growth in the base business, overcoming headwinds from declining natural gas prices in the quarter. Slide 8 provides an overview of our retail segment. First quarter EBITDA was $644 million. Retail margins were nearly $0.33 per gallon in the first quarter. These strong fuel margins were partially offset by lower fuel volumes compared to fourth quarter, reflecting demand destruction associated with COVID-19. Same store merchandise sales increased year-over-year, despite fuel demand pressures in the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of the Speedway brand. We continue to target fourth quarter 2020 for the completion of the separation of Speedway, and we are progressing separation activities. However, the separation timing could change given COVID-19 related impacts to the business environment and access to the capital markets. Slide 9 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment. Performance in this segment reflected the challenges associated with managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated shelter in place orders. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $154 million, a decrease of approximately $1.3 billion versus the fourth quarter. Margins in all regions decreased compared to fourth quarter 2019, particularly in the Midcon and West Coast regions where we saw a negative gas cracks towards the end of March. Despite these challenges, our commercial team was able to capture a favorable price realizations for both gasoline and diesel. I mean, I guess the working capital changes are really a function for us three primary things, our accounts receivable, our inventory position and then our accounts payable position. And there's lots of sort of moving pieces that impact each of those three components. What I did try to do was to give you a rule of thumb, so that you all could model changes in our business. I don't have sort of particular insight into what the amount of crude volume is in our competitor's payables and what the amount of refined products sales are in their receivables. But what I can tell you for us during the quarter accounts receivable went down for the first quarter, went down about $1.9 billion. So that was a source of cash for us receivables went down. Accounts payable went down about $2.5 billion in the quarter and that was obviously a use of cash. And then our inventories, because we're trying to manage inventory appropriately and to capture contango in the market and those types of things, our inventories were up about $400 million. So the combination of sort of $1.9 billion on the accounts receivable side and then the inventory and AP move had a negative working capital impact of about $2 billion. We are also seeing some of that and I think we've articulated, we would have seen some of that continue in April where we started buying less crude volume. So to support 3 million barrel a day system in the first quarter, we're basically now supporting 2 million barrel a day system. So in April, you would have seen crude purchases going down from a volume perspective. But as we start to ramp up, you should see the inverse of that. We will be moving upwards. We'll be buying more crude. And at least recently crude prices have started to increase as well. So that should also have a favorable impact on working capital. Mike is shaking his head. I mean, we've looked at that. I guess what we wanted to do you know, Paul, is we did provide going back about a year now. We did try to provide information that was pulling out the turnaround cost, so that you could look at sort of our adjusted EBITDA on a comparable or like to like basis. But some of our peers still actually expensed it and some of our peers obviously capitalize it. Roger, this is Don, sort of one other point. Achieving those capital cuts and those operating expense cuts does not require those refineries to be idle for the rest of the year. I think that was maybe the way you were asking the question. I mean, we assume that those will come back online. And so our OpEx numbers and our CapEx numbers assume we're operating at more normal levels as the year progresses. Phil, I guess I wanted to recommit to. We want to defend our investment grade credit profile, and we'll continue to defend that. I think Mike mentioned in the discussions around Speedway, one of the important things around the timing of the Speedway separation is our ability to capitalize Speedway and to be able to have a balance sheet at Speedway that allows them to take on some leverage. And that leverage will then result in cash at Speedway, which will be distributed back up to MPC. And when they distribute that cash back up to MPC, we would expect that distribution would be on a tax free basis and we would expect that we would be utilizing all of that cash to manage the balance sheet. It would either be putting cash on the balance sheet to sort of support our core liquidity position. So historically we've maintained about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet in addition to the revolving credit facilities that we've had. And I think we articulated when we announced the Speedway separation that we thought that requirement would probably be closer to $2 billion versus $1 billion. We'll obviously relook at sort of core liquidity in total, given all the events that have transpired over the last 30-days to make sure, or 45 days to make sure that we're fully evaluating downside risk to the company. And then the incremental amounts would be used to pay down debt. It's one of the reasons why we had some debt maturities. We have $650 million of debt maturity at the end of this year in December, and we have $1 billion of MPC debt maturity in the first quarter of 2021. And we were planning on having that debt mature, and didn't try to extend it previously, because we wanted the capability to be able to pay off debt at MPC without incurring any incremental costs to do that. So the timing of those maturities was really aligned with or coincident with Speedway transaction. We did go out into the market at the end of April and issued senior notes. Once again, we were very focused on shorter tenor notes, so three years and five years. There was some demand for 10 years but we didn't really want to get into the 10 year market. That felt like that was structural debt. We wanted to put on -- we're basically, if you will, allowing ourselves the flexibility to have shorter term debt, allows us to pay it off and allows us to manage our balance sheet without incurring significant incremental costs. Phil, I might also add, this is Don, on the working capital side. Given sort of the low volumes that were, or the low utilization rates we're at and the lower crude prices, it is really I call it asymmetric opportunity now. We would expect that working capital will be a source of cash going forward as prices improve and as volumes pick up as opposed to the significant use of cash over the last 60 days."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. As everyone is aware, the global pandemic became the focus in the quarter and that continues today, with our immediate priority on safely operating our assets to supply products to the market, protecting the health and safety of our employees and customers and supporting the communities in which we operate. The actions taken to prevent the spread of the virus has significantly reduced global economic activity and demand for our products, specifically towards the last month of the quarter. Our refining operating areas have been particularly hard hit in the upper Midwest and on the West Coast. At the same time, our midstream and retail businesses reported strong results, which offset some of the financial impact of lower refining demand and margins. As a result of this difficult situation, we're responding with prudent tactical changes in our business. First, reducing our total capital spend by $1.4 billion or approximately 30% to $3 billion for 2020. This includes approximately $700 million at MPC and $700 million at MPLX. This reduction is planned across all segments of the business with the remaining growth capital spend, primarily related to projects that are in progress or nearing completion. Second, we have reduced our planned operating expenses by approximately $950 million, primarily through reductions of fixed costs and deferring certain expense projects. This includes $750 million of operating expense reductions at MPC and $200 million of operating expense reductions at MPLX. Third, we've taken steps to maintain our financial flexibility. We've secured $3.5 billion of additional liquidity, including a new $1 billion 364-day revolver and issued $2.5 billion of senior notes. After taking these actions, we have approximately $6.8 billion of undrawn availability on our credit facilities. These actions strengthen our liquidity and also strengthen the through cycle earnings power of our business. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Don to review the first quarter results in more detail. Then I'll come back and share my early focus areas as we start to implement changes at MPC going forward. Thanks, Don. Obviously, the current environment is required our immediate focus to ensure our through cycle resiliency of our business. But I also wanted to briefly share my view for the future. Over the past decades, this company has grown to become one of the largest energy platforms in the country. Although, MPC has been successful in many areas, there's also a strong case for change to drive increased profitability, stronger through cycle earnings and long-term value creation. There are three areas that will be our early focus to help us achieve these objectives. First, we need to strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio. This means positioning our assets to be a leader in cost, operating and financial performance metrics. MPC has always been focused on safety and operational excellence and that will not change. However, we need to focus further on the contribution of each of our individual assets and ensure that financial performance in all cycles meets our expectations and contributes to shareholder returns. Second, we need to improve our commercial performance. We are fortunate to have an extensive fortunate to having it and extensive integrated footprint. We have an opportunity to be more dynamic to capture higher margins across the value chain. Success for our refining system starts with raw material selection, it's an area of opportunity for us to further take advantage of the refining asset capability. In addition, we have the opportunity to enhance and optimize the placement of our products across both the sales channels and the geographic marketplace. Focused enhancements to both raw material selection and product placement will increase our ability to maximize value across the entire value chain, increasing the margin we deliver to the bottom-line. And third, we need to lower our overall cost structure and be extremely disciplined in capital allocation. This means lowering our cost in all aspects of our business and challenging ourselves to be incredibly disciplined in every expense dollar we spend across our organization. Don Templin: As you'll recall when we rolled out our budget for 2020, our refining and marketing budget was $1.55 billion that included $450 million of maintenance capital. So it essentially included $1.1 billion of growth capital. And when we talked about our plan originally for 2020, about 60% of that growth capital was really attributable to two primary projects; one was the continuation of the STAR Program, which we'll run into next year 2021, so that's at Galveston Bay; and the other was the Dickinson renewable diesel project, which will complete this year. So if you think about 60% of our $600 million basically of capital, of the growth capital was those two projects, one will be completely done and the other will be in sort of a tapering mode and nearing completion. You'll see that we'll have a lot of flexibility around our capital budget next year. I'm going to add a little bit to the expense side. So again, back to your question, how much is variable versus structural. Obviously, with the pandemic and us reducing refining rates back to minimum, there's a portion of variable costs there. But out of the $750 million of expense reduction on the MPC side, majority of that is fixed costs that we expect to maintain at a lower level, about $500 million of it being fixed. And I'm going to let Ray kind of comment on that in that area, and then partially part of it is variable. On the midstream side, about $200 million of it mostly we said was deferred expense projects. So right now they fit in the deferred column. But as we look at that further, we're going to take a look at whether they need to be deferred or whether they actually are part of our long term plan. So let me let Ray add a little bit of color to the refining fixed costs situation. Does that answer your question, Neil? So I do believe the separation is the best value proposition for MPC shareholders. So what we said in our remarks is we are still on schedule. And the expectation that we had guided before was completion in the fourth quarter, I'd say we're still scheduling and on target to accomplish that. So strategically, I still believe the separation is the best value enhancement for MPC shareholders. The only caveat that we put out here obviously is the COVID-19 situation is still very fluid and we'll have to see how that plays out as far as recovery in the business. And then the capital market access is another important part of executing that separation in a highly efficient manner. So with those two caveats, we are still committed to separation and we're continuing on the schedule. However, we just want to be cognizant of the current environment that could implement the timing a little bit, but we'll have to see how that plays out. Doug, I'm not ready to disclose the term weak links. What I will tell you though is we're going to do a comprehensive look at all of our assets. And overtime, you're going to see us come out with disclosures as to where we feel we are from a competitive position on each of the assets. As I mentioned earlier to Neil's question, I'm a big believer in looking at long-term value of the assets. I'm a big believer in managing to free cash flow on an individual asset basis, so that the overall portfolio is generating cash. I mean as you're very aware, this is a lot to a large extent a return of capital business and I think we've done a good job of that in the past. And I think there's just an opportunity to do a little better in there if we really look at the portfolio. So I do think I hope to takeaway is we are going to spend a lot of time on the portfolio of all the assets. We're going to look at where we can improve the competitiveness of those assets, either from a cost standpoint or commercial standpoint, that's going to be a very high focus. So, I'm hoping to leave you with those three items that each asset in the portfolio is going to be examined our overall commercial approach. And we started in that discussion already is going to be discuss quite a bit. And then lastly, we're just going to lower the cost structure of the company. We think there's an opportunity to do that at this point and we're going to get after that as quickly as we can. Yes, I think so, Doug. As I said, all the assets that we have in the portfolio are going to be examined. But yes, I think so. And I previously mentioned in the midstream space that we don't want in eight basins that's still a true statement. However, the gas business is now going through a little bit of a change. But yes, it applies to all the other assets that we have in the portfolio, whether the retail assets in the short term or the refining assets as well. So yes, a real good examination of the competitiveness of our portfolio is the first priority. So I'll start off on the high level macro. Obviously, there's a lot of optimism towards recovery. At a very high macro level, fiscal policy from the administration towards stimulus packages are being implemented, monetary policies at low rates, oil prices are at low rates for consumers. So there's a lot of optimism and recovery. My caution however, is we are currently in an oversupplied market. This has been a demand driven event, both globally and in the U. S. We've been particularly hard hit in our view in the upper Midwest and in even more particularly on the West Coast. So we're optimistic that we're starting to see that recovery. We'll have some comments -- I'll let Tim comment on specifically at the gasoline level as far as our same store sales to sort of give you a little bit more color there. And and then I'll let Brian give you a little color overall on the diesel market as well. So I'd say overall, optimistically that we're seeing good signs of recovery, but we still got a long way to go that we're still over supplied on pretty much crude and products across the board. So there's a lot of inventory that needs to work off. As far as when do you respond? Obviously, the market will tell us that. So it's a demand driven event. And when the demand is sufficient for us to change our strategy we'll do that. But for right now, we're staying at minimum rates. So let me let Tim comment a little bit about what we're seeing at Speedway. And I'm going to let Ray give you some specifics there. But I would add one comment to your question and kind of what Doug was asking as well is, I think there is some belief and we have this belief that there could be slower recovery back into the jet world. But that may also be a little bit of a boost to gasoline recovery, as consumers kind of stay more towards vehicles as opposed to airplanes, as the recovery starts to happen. I think that's a phenomenon that we're going to see a little bit. But let me let Ray give you some specifics on jet and diesel. First of all, I mean you hit it on the head. My personal background is more in the commercial area in the financial area. So it's an area where I'm going to spend a lot of my early time here. I don't want to give any real specifics. But to your second question, though, we do plan to have a bigger presence in Houston that's something that's on our list of things that we want to accomplish. We have not had that in the past. So Rick and his team are moving towards that. They've already had some stuff down in the Texas area. So I think you're going to see us over time you know develop much more of a presence down in that area. I'm a believer that the Houston market is the center of the oil markets in the U. S. just like New York is the center of the financial market. So having a Houston presence, I think is really important for us. As far as talent overall, it's another area that I think we're going to spend quite a bit of time, looking at where we can improve some of our talent across that area. So I guess, the good news and the bad news for my commercial team is I have a lot of background in this area. I have a lot of strong thoughts and how to approach things. So, there's going to be a good collaborative discussion about how to go about it. And I will tell you we started in that already. The immediate focus of what's happening with the markets as a result of COVID has forced a lot of discussion here. So, again due to the the competitive nature of it, Paul, I can't get into a lot of specifics here. But I can tell you as I stated earlier, it's one of my main three areas that we're going to spend a lot of time on. I've taken a second here to see what you were thinking there, Paul. I mean, there's some areas where I think we could be too conservative, there's other areas where there's different types of opportunities. I don't really think of it overall in that regard. I think of it more in how we approach the market, how we go about crude selection, how we use different things. I mean, we recently just saw pretty strong crude market contango and how to take advantage of that as an example, is some of the discussions that we've had recently. So I don't know if I'd use your term as the catch all for what we're doing. I think of it more as looking at what our assets do, how we position ourselves commercially, looking at how the markets are responding, where product placement is best suited. So I think having maybe a little bit more quick flexibility and reacting to markets quickly, if you're using that term to be conservative then maybe I agree with that from that perspective. But I just think, I use the word being more dynamic, more flexible, more able to adapt to market conditions quicker. And then overall, just having much more focus on what we're doing commercially to support the assets that we have in place. And I will tell you, one of the things that as a result of this COVID situation. We were having daily meetings on what was occurring in the marketplace and how we should be responding to that. And that's just one example of what the new environment will be going forward. I'll start off and then I'll turn it over to Ray. One of the things that I think everybody realizes is the different regions have been hit harder or less to some extent depending on where you are. I mean, we've been particularly hard hit on the West Coast. If you're looking at our guidance, we're at minimum across the system. But in the West Coast system, we're running at about 50% of capacity as opposed to the roughly 66-67-ish overall. So the West Coast demand drop was even more severe than I'll say the whole national average, which led us to take more action on the West Coast specifically in that area. So let me turn over to Ray to give you a little more color on both Gallup and Martinez. So we stated that those assets are idled on a temporary basis, and we'll have to see when the market requires them to come back online. I think the question you were asking though is, we don't see significant costs at all to bring those back up. I mean, Ray has them on hot standby, so I'll let him comment on that. So we are prepared to bring those back online when the demand in the market have requires it. We just in the short-term have seen some recovery, as Tim and Brian had alluded to earlier. But we still have a ways to go before we would be needing that asset, so to speak. Roger, so we started in that analysis and obviously, I've been part of the Marathon team for a while here, so I have my own initial thoughts. The only caveat I would give you though is in the 45 days or so that I've had to home, most of our time and most of the whole senior team's time has been dedicated to the near-term situation. So hopefully, we'll get back to normal in the health situation as far as the country and also as far as the economy and get back to normal. But we started into the process. But I would also tell you that a lot of the time recently has been dedicated to the near in situation. So started more to come and I hope to disclose more as time goes by. But I don't want to kid you that the opportunity has been limited, because of the near-term situation and our focus on trying to respond to the pandemic. On dividend policy, first off as you know, it's a board decision. And we had some very robust discussion about it. We think about this in the long-term and how do we see the business, you know as far as mid cycle earnings and how we see the business in the long-term. We obviously decided we wouldn't want to make a major change in return of capital on what hopefully is a very short-term issue. So our discussion led to our highest priority was defending liquidity, as Don said, and defending our investment grade rating that was very important to us. And I would just comment that we went into this event, if you want to call it that, with a little under $7 billion of liquidity. And now we've taken the working capital pain with a reduction in crude price, et cetera. And as Don stated in his remarks, we're sitting here at about that very same level. So we still have a lot of liquidity going forward. As far as recovery in the business, hopefully, it'll be sooner rather than later. I think you're hearing from our team, there's cautious optimism that we could be coming back. Yet at the same time, as Tim mentioned, we're still pretty far down year-on-year on gasoline demand, but we'll have to see how that recovers. But overall, our return of capital is something that we obviously think is really important. I mentioned earlier, I think this is to a large extent refining is a return of capital business. So we'll have a lot of discussion with the board as to how that plays out going forward. Prashant, I think the easy answer to your first question is yes. And then to your second point, the approach that I believe is especially in this type of business which is very volatile and when you invest capital, you're investing for a very long time. So I think using the word strict discipline is the best way to describe it. I stress test in general how do we think about investing capital if X occurs or if Y occurs. And my own personal bias is, because this refining business is very cyclical and there are downturns, you got to make sure that you're still getting a good return, even if you're having a down cycle so to speak. So overall, I think without giving you a specific number, we will be stress testing or in your terms, raising the hurdle rate to make sure that the investment that we do is very long lasting and is going to guarantee us a good return. So in general, that will translate to a higher hurdle. Yes, without giving you a number, I would say, yes, that's correct. And I think you're going to see us have a lot more robust discussion on the strategic nature of where we invest and guaranteeing ourselves that it is long-term investment and convincing ourselves that it's a good use of capital. I mean at the end of the day, we're stewards of the shareholders' capital and that's one of the most important things we can control. I mean, in our business and I know you guys often ask a lot of questions about our views on things that we don't control, and we're happy to give you our views. But I try to spend a lot more time on the things we do control. And obviously have an opinion of things that we don't control as far as market conditions, et cetera, et cetera. But really spend as much time as we can on the things that we actually control and having discipline about how we spend that money, whether it's organic capital, whether it's M&A, whether it's expense dollars et cetera, et cetera. I think all those deserve a lot of attention and that's part of what we will focus going forward on. I'll give a couple thoughts. One is we did the term of cautious optimism that we're seeing some recovery. But I also try and balance that with the overall inventories we still have, I don't know what the exact number is. Dave can jump in. Maybe 30 million barrels of light products, gasoline and distillates that are over the long-term average. We're still sitting on roughly 50 million barrels of crude over that same long-term average. So even though I think we're seeing demand start to recover, I still think we have ways to go to get back to some closer to normal inventory levels and normal demand levels. So, I think that's just going to play itself out. Again, that falls into the category of something we don't control. We'll try and keep an eye on the demand. We do have some insights from our marketing view and we'll try and match the supply of our products into those demands. And then we're always going to try and be opportunistic to find the best market or the best region to optimize our system."

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, and thanks for joining our call.  Before we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment. During the fourth quarter, despite the widespread surge in Omicron variant cases, gasoline demand held up well. And on diesel, we're seeing highway trucking volumes continuing to meet or exceed seasonal records. While jet demand reached post-pandemic highs in the fourth quarter, it's still roughly 15% below 2019 levels as business travel remains suppressed, but we expect to see recovery in that this year as well.  When we spoke with you in November, we were cautious about rising COVID cases this winter and the potential impact. Based on the trends over the last few months, we've become less concerned about the pace of recovery in transportation fuels demand. Light product inventories remain tight and U.S. demand continues to recover. We believe that refining margins will be well positioned for 2022.  On the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we made continued progress on our priorities. Since our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we've repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares. That puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion share repurchase program. Further reinforcing our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we obtained board approval for an additional $5 billion in share repurchase authorization. This brings our total outstanding authorization to approximately $9.5 billion.  Today, we announced our 2022 capital spending outlook. We expect MPC will have approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, with approximately 50% of the $1.3 billion growth capital for our Martinez refinery conversion. Total costs for the Martinez refinery conversion is estimated at $1.2 billion. Approximately $300 million has been spent to date, $700 million for 2022 and $200 million for 2023. This competitive capital cost is driven by the fact that Martinez' assets are conducive to retrofit, and we can leverage existing infrastructure and logistics.  At Martinez, the project reached another milestone as a 60-day comment period for the Environmental Impact Report concluded on December 17, 2021. We remain committed to progressing the conversion to a renewable fuels facility, engineering is complete and we're ready to begin construction. Our plan is to have the first phase start-up in the second half of '22.  We've already sourced some advantaged feedstocks for the Martinez facility and are engaged in negotiations with multiple parties for the balance. Our strategy is multifaceted, including long-term arrangements, joint ventures and alliances, all of which are common in this space. A recent example of our success would be our joint venture with ADM. We're also leveraging existing capabilities that are currently supporting Dickinson to optimize between the 2 facilities. We remain confident in our progress and ability to secure feedstocks for Martinez.  On Kenai, we have been working at sales process since we last communicated. We'll be back to you when we have additional details that we can share. In 2021, we progressed all 3 of our strategic initiatives, and Slide 4 highlights this execution. On the portfolio, we completed the Speedway sale, receiving $17.2 billion of proceeds from that transaction and securing the 15-year fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven. Our Dickinson renewable diesel facility started up, reached capacity, and we've been successfully optimizing the operation. We made 2 strategic decisions to idle our Gallup refinery and to convert Martinez to a renewable fuels facility. And this year, MPLX produced exceptionally strong cash flow, which provided $2.2 billion of contributions to MPC.  As we look at cost reduction, what began as a $1.5 billion cost-reduction initiative is being embraced by the organization and now a low-cost culture is becoming embedded in how we conduct our business.  Finally, on commercial. While I've been reluctant to share too much, I wanted to highlight a few items that have commercial significance in our portfolio. In March of 2021, we started up the Beatrice pretreatment facility, which processes about 3,000 barrels a day of advantaged feedstock for the Dickinson renewable diesel plan. In December, we closed on a joint venture with ADM, which will provide approximately 5,000 barrels a day of logistically advantaged feedstock for Dickinson when the new soybean crush plant comes online in 2023.  And in January of this year, we successfully started up our Cincinnati pretreatment facility, which will process about 2,000 barrels per day for our Dickinson renewable diesel plant. We converted this facility from its original configuration as a biodiesel plant.  Our team's execution on these 3 strategic priorities builds a foundation for continued value creation and we look forward to sharing updates each quarter as we continue to advance these initiatives.  Shifting to Slide 5. We remain focused on challenging ourselves to leading in sustainable energy. We have 3 company-wide targets on GHG, methane and freshwater intensity than many of our investors and stakeholders know well. In the coming weeks, we look forward to providing an update on our progress against these targets and some of our accomplishments in 2021.  At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann to review the fourth quarter results.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.27 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.30. Adjusted earnings exclude $132 million of pretax charges related to make-whole premiums for the $2.1 billion in senior notes we redeemed in December. Additionally, the adjustments include an incremental $112 million of tax expense, which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate.  Beginning with our first quarter 2022 results, we will be reporting our effective tax rate on an actual basis and will no longer adjust our actual results to a 24% tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $400 million higher from the prior quarter. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $2 billion, which is an increase of almost $300 million from the prior quarter.  Finally, during the quarter, we returned $354 million to shareholders through dividend payments and approximately $2.7 billion in share repurchases. In the 3 months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares.  Slide 7 illustrates the progress we have made towards lowering our cost structure over the past 2 years. As we think about our strategy on cost structure, I want to emphasize a few things. We will never compromise the safety of employees or the integrity of our assets. And we are committed to ensure the current cost reductions are sustainable, even during periods of general cost pressures.  Since the beginning of 2020, we have been able to maintain roughly $1.5 billion of cost reductions that have been taken out of the company's total cost. Refining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion. Our refining operating costs in 2020 began at $6 per barrel. While we were able to finish 2021 with a full year operating cost per barrel that was $5. Additionally, midstream was reduced by $400 million and corporate cost by about $100 million.  However, regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion. This improvement is expected to make the company more resilient in future downcycles, while having more bottom line profitability and upcycles.  Turning to Slide 8. We would like to highlight our financial priorities for 2022. First, sustaining capital as we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Second, we're committed to the dividend. As we continue to purchase shares, we will reduce the share count and increase the potential of returnable cash flow.  Third, we continue to believe this is both a return on and return of capital business and we will continue to invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. In traditional refining, we're focused on investments that are resilient and reduce cost. In renewables, current spend is primarily focused on our Martinez renewable fuel conversion. We believe that share repurchases can be used to meaningfully return capital to shareholders.  In order to successfully execute the strategies guided by these priorities, MPC needs a strong balance sheet as a foundation. We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade credit profile.  Moving to another key focus area. Slide 9 highlights our focus on strict capital discipline. Today, we announced our 2022 capital outlook for MPC. MPC's 2022 capital investment plan totals approximately $1.7 billion. As we continue to focus on strict capital discipline, our overall spend remains approximately 30% below 2019 spending levels. Sustaining capital is approximately 20% of capital spend, underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance.  Of the remaining 80% for growth, approximately 50% of this $1.3 billion supports the conversion of Martinez into a renewable fuels facility. The remainder of the growth capital is for other projects already underway. At our refineries, the growth capital is primarily for projects that enhance returns at MPC's large coastal assets with a focus on completing Galveston Bay STAR project as well as smaller projects at Garyville and Los Angeles. Going forward, we expect growth capital will continue to have a significant portion for renewables and projects that will help us reduce future operating cost.  Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by a $354 million increase from Refining & Marketing. The adjustment column reflects $132 million of pretax charges for make-whole premiums for debt redemption during the quarter, which has also been excluded from the interest column.  Moving to our segment results. Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. The business reported continued improvement from last quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion. Fourth quarter EBITDA increased $354 million when compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins in the U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast regions.  U.S. Gulf Coast production increased by 14%, recovering from storm-related downtime last quarter and solid margin per barrel increased 31% due to higher export sales and higher sales of light product inventory. The West Coast margin per barrel increased 40% associated with increased demand and refinery outages. Utilization was 94% for the quarter, slightly improved from the third quarter. The higher Gulf Coast throughput was offset by lower throughput in the Mid-Con for planned turnaround activity.  Operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. There was also higher routine maintenance and planned project expense. Additionally, we saw natural gas prices softened during the quarter, coming off highs in the $5 to $6 range and ending in the $3 to $4 range.  Slide 12 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2021. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter.  Slide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $2 billion in the quarter. This excludes changes in working capital and also excludes the cash we received for our CARES tax refund in the quarter, which was approximately $1.6 billion source of cash and is included in the income tax part of the chart. Working capital was an approximate $1.3 billion source of cash this quarter, driven primarily by reduction in crude and product inventory.  As we announced on last quarter's call, MPC redeemed $2.1 billion in senior notes in December. Under income taxes, we received approximately $1.6 billion of our CARES tax refund in the fourth quarter. We also used about $300 million to offset against our Speedway tax obligation. There is about $60 million of the refund remaining, which we expect in the first half of 2022. We paid approximately $1.2 billion for our Speedway income tax obligation. All that remains is about $50 million of state and local taxes.  With respect to capital return during the quarter, MPC returned $354 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $2.7 billion worth of shares. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $10.8 billion in cash and short-term investments.  Slide 14 provides our capital investment plan for 2022 which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.7 billion. The plan includes $1.6 billion for Refining & Marketing segment, of which approximately $300 million or roughly 20% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance spending.  Our growth capital plan is approximately $1.3 billion, split between renewables and ongoing projects. Within renewable spending, the majority is allocated for the Martinez conversion. Ongoing projects in our Refining & Marketing segment will enhance the capability of our refining assets, particularly in the Gulf Coast and also support our focus on growing the value recognized from our Marathon and ARCO marketing brands.  Also included is approximately $100 million of corporate spending to support activities we believe will enhance our ability to lower future costs and capture commercial value.  This morning, MPLX also announced their 2022 capital investment plan of $900 million. Their plan includes approximately $700 million of growth capital, $140 million of maintenance capital and $60 million for the repayment of their share of the Bakken Pipeline joint venture's debt due in 2022.  On Slide 15, we review our progress on our return of capital. Since our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of company shares. This puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion repurchase program commitment, leaving approximately $4.5 billion remaining. We remain committed to complete the $10 billion program by the end of 2022. And as we are ahead of pace given our recent repurchases, could foresee completion sooner than initially planned.  As part of our long-term commitment to return capital, we announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization today, increasing our recent repurchase authorizations to $15 billion. We plan to continue using open market repurchase programs, although all of the programs we have previously discussed remain available to us to complete our commitment. We intend to use programs that allow us to buy on an ongoing basis, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings call.  As we have said many times, we believe a strong balance sheet is essential to being successful in a competitive commodity business. It's the foundation allowing us to execute our strategy. Slide 16 highlights some of the key points about our balance sheet.  MPC ended the year with approximately $10.8 billion of cash and short-term investments. But longer term, we believe that we will need to maintain about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Additionally, we will always ensure that we have enough liquidity to endure market fluctuations.  Currently, we have a $5 billion bank revolver that is undrawn. We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade profile. At year-end, MPC's gross debt-to-capital ratio is 21% and our long-term gross debt-to-capital target is approximately 30%. As we continue to execute our share repurchase program, we will see that ratio increase. After the recent redemption in December, our current structural debt is approximately $6.5 billion, and we do not have any maturities until 2024.  Turning to guidance. Slide 17, we provide our first quarterly outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.9 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $155 million in the first quarter. The majority of the activity will be in the Gulf Coast region. Our 2022 planned turnaround activity is back half-weighted this year.  Total operating costs are projected to be $5.10 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. And with that, operator, we'll open it to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Mike, Maryann, I think this is the first time you've spoken, so happy new year. Great start to the year with your earnings. But I got a couple of questions, if I may. The first one, Maryann, is maybe for you on the dividend policy going forward. And I guess the way I want to frame the question is when you're done with your buybacks, the absolute dividend burden is going to be quite a bit lower than it is today and quite a bit lower than the distribution you get from MPLX, your share. So what are you thinking -- with the yield now down around 3%, what are you thinking in terms of the appropriate payout ratio, if you like, or dividend policy going forward? How should we think of that evolving?\nMaryann Mannen: So maybe a couple of things. First, as you've seen from the capital framework that we've been sharing this morning, the dividend obviously remains an important piece of the capital allocation strategy. As you look, you're right, as we continue to complete our capital program -- share repurchase program, the amount of capital that's allocated towards the dividend, obviously, will be declining. We think that's somewhere -- if you look at the current dividend versus where it's been, that's somewhere in the range of $200 million to $300 million right now.  We continue to think that share repurchase in the short term is an appropriate allocation of that. As we get to what we would consider to be a capital structure in a more normal environment, meaning we complete that share repurchase, we'll continue to evaluate the timing of any dividend change. But again, when you look at the difference in that dividend payment, we certainly think that we're providing that allocation in an appropriate manner.\nMichael Hennigan: Doug, it's Mike. Let me just add a little bit to Mary's comments. One of the things that I think may be getting misconstrued is we are still committed to the dividend, as Mary just said. However, we're in a little bit of a different situation than normal operating cash flow. I mean we're sitting with about $11 billion on the balance sheet in a large return program. And as you just saw, we did about $3 billion since the last call.  So as far as order of magnitude, we're committed to returning capital. But right now, the size of the share repurchase relative to the dividend is just out of proportion until we get to a more normal balance sheet. So I don't want people to think we're not committed to the dividend. We are going to evaluate it, as Mary just said. But right now, we're putting a lot of the effort in the return into the buyback program. I hope that helps.\nDoug Leggate: It does. It's just that you've got a lot of headroom to do all of the above, I guess. And I just was curious given the share price, the yield is now back at a sub-average level, I guess, you could say. So a lot of seems has a lot of headroom there, but thank you for that. My follow-up is maybe a little bit of a technical question, and I don't know if Ray is on, but -- or if one of you guys want to try this, but what I'm really interested in is we saw some structural changes 20 years ago. That reset the mid-cycle refining earnings capacity, if you like, with alkylate and with mismatch of demand supply and so on.  And what we are real interested in is what's happening with natural gas between The U.S. and Europe and the structural advantage that puts on U.S. refiners. And I'm wondering if you've given any thought to that in terms of whether you believe that if what we're seeing in Europe, let's say, or internationally currently could be another structural tailwind for realized refining margins for U.S. refiners and Marathon specifically.\nMichael Hennigan: Doug, it's Mike. Let me -- I'm going to put that over to Brian on products and Rick on crude to give you a little bit of color. It's a good question. Obviously, that dynamic is occurring in Europe. So why don't you start, Brian?\nBrian Partee: Yes, sure. This is Brian. Great question. So I think the short answer is too early to tell, but I think you're on to it. Maryann mentioned in her prepared comments, the volatility we've seen in natural gas over the last several months. We've gone from $3 gas to $6 down to $4, now we're peaking back up to 5. So directionally, yes, very supportive relative to the cheap natural gas position we have that we believe is certainly sustainable over the long term in The U.S. But ultimately, these are long-term decisions for anybody that has that exposure overseas to higher natural gas prices. But yes, directionally, we do see it as supportive. It's just a little bit too early to tell. But if we stay in this $5 to $6 gas range, it will absolutely put pressure on those that have that exposure, and we'll look for upside. But it's one of many variables.\nDoug Leggate: I'm curious, have you seen any shift in imports coming from Europe as a consequence of that cost disadvantage? And I'll leave it there.\nBrian Partee: Yes. No, from an import perspective, not yet. I mean, that's one thing that we're looking at, both the fundamental balance in the Atlantic Basin looking at opportunities to actually export into Europe. But the ARPS has been pretty stable. No big immediate changes here in the short term, but we're watching it very closely.\nRick Hessling: Doug, it's Rick. I'll just add on a few more comments. With Europe at $30 an MMBTU or thereabouts, there's no doubt a structural advantage. But with that being said, what we're seeing right now out of Europe is just slight run cuts at best because their margins are covering or higher up OpEx costs. So we haven't seen the impact substantially yet. If it continues, I think that's another story. So as Brian said, it's still a little bit too early to tell.  But then I'll also leave you with a couple of wild cards that we're watching closely, which could exasperate it as well in terms of nat gas costs. It's the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which we're all well aware of. And then ultimately, it's Nordstream 2 and what is the result that comes out of that. So a tailwind could get much better depending on how either 1 of these 2 plays out. It's just a little bit too early, Doug.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Prashant Rao with Citigroup.\nPrashant Rao: I wanted to switch to talking about renewable diesel a bit. But first, on Martinez, could we dive in a little bit to the CapEx that you've outlined specifically, what all is getting completed this year? And I guess related to that, does that sort of tie into the utilization level we see for the guidance on the West Coast? And when you talk about back half weighted turnarounds as well, is that sort of impacting that too? And I have a follow-up.\nMichael Hennigan: Ray, can you give a Martinez update?\nRaymond Brooks: Yes, sure. Thanks for that question. And if I start talking about Martinez and before I get into the CapEx, I kind of want to talk about where we're at with the project in regards to permitting. And so as we covered before, we completed the public comment period in December. And right now, over the last 1.5 months, we've been working really hard with the [indiscernible] to address all questions and get the permit to the finish line. And so we're really targeting the end of Q1 to have the sequel permit done and be ready to put shovels in the ground.  And with that, what I want to emphasize is we're absolutely ready to do that. Our engineering is complete for the first phase. It's nearly complete for the backup few phases. We have the equipment on site. We have the pipe, we have the pilings. We have the vessels that we need to do this project. So we're ready from that standpoint.  Now as far as what's in the project, I've talked a lot over the past couple of calls about why Martinez makes sense. And I've talked about 3 hydroprocessing units, 2 hydrogen plants. I've talked about the Cogen power generation on site. As far as what we're spending the money on, what I want to emphasize is a couple of key things in that regard. One is pretreatment. This project is really driven by -- we want to be able to process all the renewable feedstocks, and we want to be able to pretreat them ourselves.  So we've invested in pretreatment capabilities. We're really excited about the technology that we've chosen. We feel it is a good technology that we're spending money on that will have a lower CapEx, have sustainability advantages. So we feel good about that. And then the other thing I want to emphasize is we're investing a lot in logistics. Why Martinez? Martinez has scale, Martinez has optionality. And so we have optionality on truck, rail, pipe and water as far as bringing feedstocks in and products out. So I just wanted to give a little bit of color on, hey, what we're spending money on in 2022.\nPrashant Rao: The follow-up -- I'm sorry, go ahead.\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Prashant, it's Mike. I just want to add a little bit more color to what Ray said. So if you back up, the way I've looked at this project from the beginning is do we have competitive CapEx? Do we have competitive OpEx and logistics and ultimately, feedstock to make it work? So Ray has just talked a little bit about the CapEx, and we finally have disclosed that number. Part of the reason I wanted to explain that we hadn't disclosed it up until this point is because we've been working the feedstock side of the business pretty detailed and that's still in progress. So hopefully, we'll give more updates as time goes by. But we're at a point as we've negotiated with a lot of different counterparties that we felt comfortable now that we can disclose the CapEx because that's been part of all the discussions and all the negotiations that have occurred on that side of the ledger. So I think us disclosing that now, Ray, trying to give you a little bit more feel for -- we put some CapEx in that we believe is going to give us lower operating expenses over time. And I think the whole puzzle is kind of coming together is the way we thought of the project: competitive CapEx, competitive OpEx, good logistics, as Ray just mentioned. And then like I said, we're still working on that feedstock side, but we're pretty far along in what we're trying to accomplish there.\nPrashant Rao: That's super helpful. And I wanted to pick up on the feedstock side and specifically the pretreatment that you highlighted. You highlighted that Beatrice that came up last year. You've got the Cincinnati project now. Pretreatment is a big part of Martinez, it sounds like. So kind of a 2-parter. One is just more broad big picture, what we're seeing in a world right now where the differentials between feedstocks are trying to -- are getting tighter. Some of that is -- could be temporary based upon timing of projects coming online and logistical issues, but some of it might be related to some shifts going on, and I think that's a bit of a debate shift going on in reflecting CI scores.  So I guess this is sort of a bigger philosophical question is the value of pretreatment or how do you pivot on what your pretreatment do or what you want to scope out as you think about how feedstock differentials might change as the supply ramp globally but specifically within The U.S. goes up. And I'll leave it there.\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Prashant, it's Mike. I'll start off and then I'll let Brian or Ray jump in if they'd like to. One of the things people have asked me about, can you talk a little bit about commercial stuff. And I've tried not to go into a lot of detail there. But the point you're making has got a little bit of portfolio and a little bit of commercial side to it. Long term, I think the point you're making is markets equilibrate and you'll see some competitiveness and we agree with that. It's part of the reason that we stress test Martinez.  But in the short term, we've got Dickinson up and running and you got to be fast in this business. You got to be quick. And I think what you're seeing through the team effort here because it's our portfolio and it's part commercial was to get this Beatrice plant up and running, get 3,000 barrels a day of really advantaged feedstock there, get a couple of thousand barrels a day of converting the biodiesel plant.  So it's partly the portfolio or the engineering team working with the commercial team. To your point, right at the moment, those feedstocks are advantaged and getting pretreated. Long term, you're right. The competitiveness will change over time. There will be more equilibrium. But at the same time, as Ray talked about, we felt having full pretreatment at Martinez was still going to be a good thing for us in the long term.  And the technology that we pick there, so there's a lot of important thoughts from an engineering and technical side that also married to what we want to try and achieve commercially. And like I said, hopefully, we'll be able to give you a little bit more color on feedstock as time goes by. But we felt it was a good enough time to explain what the CapEx number is and how we're feeling about it.\nPrashant Rao: That's super helpful.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Two questions for me. The first one is on refining. Capture rate, as you show on Slide 22, was very strong, 116% this quarter. And I recognize capture rates are very hard metrics to try to calibrate. But on Slide 23, you help us think through some things like other margins. So Mike, I guess the question for you is, how much of this do you think is a carryforward versus a onetime dynamic? And are some of the things that you talked about around optimizing the commercial side of the business and getting your costs down starting to show up in that capture rate number.\nMaryann Mannen: Neil, it's Maryann. Let me try to give you some color there, and then I'll pass it back to Mike. So I appreciate the comments. In the quarter, as you saw, about 116% capture overall. We had a couple of things happening in the quarter. One, in general, inventory was a tailwind for us this quarter. We have inventory impacts period-to-period. You can actually look at the third quarter as an example of that. Capture was about 100%. We benefited from crude timing impacts from running some advantage third quarter inventories purchased and we ran that in the fourth quarter. And we had some seasonally strong marketing margins. So historically, I think we have been talking about a baseline for our refining capture in and about a range of 95%. And while there's volatility in the quarter -- quarter-to-quarter, we're looking right now, we think, just based on this commercial execution that we've been talking about that our baseline is more like 100%.  I'll make a couple of comments, and then again, I'll pass it on to Mike, just something specific in the quarter. We did benefit in the fourth quarter from an adjustment $62 million for the full year adjustment for the 2021 RINs. That's pretty ratable quarter-by-quarter, so 1/4 of that belongs in the quarter. And we also did see a benefit of about $39 million for the Dickinson LCFS adjustment for lower CI in the quarter. So there are a few things that benefited the quarter overall. And I'll pass it back to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Neil, I'm going to add, but it looks like Brian wants to jump in and want to comment, and then I'll finish up.\nBrian Partee: Yes, Neil, thanks for the question. This is Brian. So just commercially, we are hyper-focused on optimization and improvement. I think we've been pretty transparent and clear about that as one of our 3 key strategic initiatives. So just a bit of color. The Gulf Coast was an area here over the last quarter where we saw some nice, marked improvements in our operations commercially that help to drive a better capture.  Really fundamentally, what's helping with that for us and our business is better alignment of the team. We're getting the right resources and getting them focused in the right areas and aligned efficiently. In a couple of examples, in the Gulf Coast, just highlighting that as an example, it's really helping us drive our marketing book and our growth in and along the Gulf Coast.  And then our export expansion as well. We've been really focused on our expansion of our export book. And specific to our export book, we're really focused on more delivered cargoes. So we're moving further down the value chain, higher margin capture. So we've had a lot of success in growing that line of our business.  And then lastly, we did take in a position in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter that allows us to optimize supply both internationally and domestically, particularly into Florida as well as developing blending program in and along the Caribbean. So I just wanted to provide some color and some examples of things that we're doing to help advance our commercial initiatives.\nMichael Hennigan: And Neil, it's Mike. One of the things -- happy with the progress that Brian and the team are making in some of those areas. But I do want to stay on the record that I'm not a big fan of this metric. I've said that many, many times. And the main reason is because there's other things that can drive the metric in different directions. The spread between light products and heavy products is the most dominant feature in it.  And I just want to remind people that you can have a low capture rate if you're still making a lot of money or you could have a high capture rate and not be making as much. So you got to be a little careful or you got to dig into the details because the metric itself has some flaws. Now with that said, am I glad that we're making incremental progress? Sure. I think all things being equal, we want to see the number up higher than not.  But I just keep want to caution, Kristina is tired of me saying this to her all the time that there's other factors that influence that metric that can mislead or misalign some of the activities going on. But overall, as Mary said and Brian said, good things happen should drive that in the right direction. But I just want to keep putting that caution out.  I'm still challenging Kristina and our team to come up with a better way to do it. We haven't come up with that yet, but we're working on it because I think we may be able to come up with something that might be a little better. But in the meantime, I know everybody tracks this one and is used to looking at it. So it is what it is, and I just wanted to make sure I had that caution on it.\nNeil Mehta: It's been clear about that and a lot of good perspective there. The follow-up is back on Martinez. Thanks for the $1.2 billion. Is there a way to tie that into an EBITDA number, either with or without the blenders tax credit? Or is it still too early for you guys to come out there with an EBITDA number that we can then ultimately tie back into returns?\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Neil, it's a good question. It is still a little early. What I was saying earlier is we're still actively engaged in some feedstock discussions. So we can't go to that disclosure. We got to the point with our discussions that capital is now very open with everybody, so we thought we could disclose it. So that's where we are in the process. You saw in our prepared remarks, we have secured some feedstock. We're still in some discussions, but still a little premature.  But we were thinking that we could at least put the capital out there and that would give some color to some of the questions that people have been asking us. And I know it's taken a little bit of time, but part of it is we couldn't disclose it while we were still in some level of those negotiations. Now that we're past that, we can disclose that piece, but we still have some activity going on.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe to kind of take up where part of the answer to Neil's question left off. Yes, you made the comment, Mike, about capture doesn't tell the whole story. And obviously, one of the big things is the reduction in costs. So as we look at the conversion of Martinez, the closure of Gallup, we think about that in terms of the impact on costs, and we think about that as an impact on capture. What else should we be thinking about is going on? And is there any possibility you can quantify across those items to help us understand what we ought to consider as sustainable and what we ought to consider as maybe just a product of current market environment?\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Roger, it's a good question. What I'm trying to say is the metric can be driven by different factors other than what we're doing than things we have control of. Brian was mentioning some of the things that we have control of that we think are increasing our commercial capture. What I was trying to say, sometimes the spreads themselves can drive that metric in a different direction.  So the only thing I was trying to say is the metric itself has some good parts to it. It has some bad parts to it. And you usually have to drill down to really understand what's happening. Now like I just said, I'm happy with the commercial team making progress. For apples-to-apples, we want to see that number higher. But I just want to continue to caution people that there's some flaws in the metric or some other things that drive it, just like Mary said in her remarks.  So part of, like you said, cost and everything that we're doing on that side, is still a high focus. We have a lot of focus, as Brian said, on the commercial side of the business, trying to be a little reluctant to give a lot of details in that regard because of the competitive nature of it, but also listening to people saying, \"Hey, can you give me some color what's going on there? So we tried to pick a few examples that we could give you a little bit of the way we're thinking about it. And hoping it helps, but I'll leave it there.\nMaryann Mannen: One other small add to make, maybe as you're thinking about that cost and sustainability -- the sustainability of the cost reductions, keep in mind that as we are in the middle of this Martinez conversion, there are current operating costs included in that capture rate that you're seeing now. So those operating costs to complete the conversion, the day-to-day operating costs are already embedded in that capture rate as you're seeing it today.\nRoger Read: Okay. Yes. That's -- so -- well, I'll say the follow-up on that for another time. I guess the other question I had on the commercial side, obviously, it's been a focus of the company. You had a change in leadership there and I was just curious how you see the commercial ops going forward and how that should work its way out. .\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Roger, it's Mike. I'll take that again. I would say, in general, you're referring to that we made a change at the CCO level. I do want to say, Brian was a contributor this year. He's a nice guy and a very smart guy. And commercial team has been doing some really good stuff. But ultimately, we weren't in sync on philosophy and expectations, so I thought a change was necessary.  But I don't want to diminish the progress that the team has made. I don't want to diminish Rick and Brian who are on the call here today and their teams are -- I love Brian's word, hyperfocused. I was glad to hear that. We think there is opportunity for us in this area. And like I said, we had a little bit of philosophical and expectation differences that I just thought it was -- is warranted to make a change rather than try and get that back on track. It was warranted to make a change.  But I'm happy with the progress that's been occurring. I think we have clear line of sight of some other opportunities for us. I know we frustrate people by not giving a lot of detail there, but hopefully, you'll just continue to see it in results, and we'll try to think of ways and opportunities that we can explain some things that will help you guys understand the business from our perspective a little better.\nRoger Read: No, I appreciate that, and don't worry about it. We'll make sure to keep you frustrated from questions coming from the sell side. .\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: Mike and team, my question is a little bit around the CapEx of Martinez, it's about 1.2. If my math is right, that's putting you about that $1.6 or $1.65 a gallon with a very good pre-treat. And what we are generally seeing out there is people who are trying to build really high-class pre-treats are hitting that cost of about $3.25 to $3.50. So if you can talk about your comfort level with that CapEx, what is allowing you to do it at about 50% of what others are doing? And what role has already operations at Dickinson where you are already making R&D? What are the learnings from there, which are basically kind of, I think, allowing you to bring this facility on at a highly discounted CapEx per gallon basis?\nRaymond Brooks: Manav, this is Ray. Let me take another shot at talking about Martinez and your math is right. It's about $1.60 a capacity gallon for that, which we feel good about compared to the industry and why we are excited about this project. As far as why that's the case, it gets back to the toolkit that's already sitting there at Martinez, 3 hydrocrackers, hydro treaters, 2 hydrogen plants and a Cogen facility.  So what we're investing, the big thing that's new is investing in the pretreat system. The rest that we're doing is we're investing a lot in connectivity, piping to get all those units to go to the right places and logistics from that standpoint. So largely, the reconfiguring of Martinez allowed us to have a very capital-efficient project.\nMichael Hennigan: And Manav, it's Mike. I just want to reemphasize something that's important and give Ray and his team some credit for. I mean, at the end of the day, we spend a lot of time thinking about this CapEx. And ultimately, to your point, it's a good number, but we actually had a lower capital case that we thought would have a higher operating expense, as Ray mentioned. And we chose to spend a little more capital.  So trying to bring a little more commerciality into the decision to assist the technical side of it, I think, has played out really well for us. Ray hasn't talked a lot about it, but the technology that we picked there was very important. And offline, we can talk to you a little bit about that, but that's a very important part of how this project has played itself out, choosing to go a little higher on CapEx even though it's a pretty good rate, just so that we get lower OpEx.  It was an important part of the discussion. The sustainability of the project and the way we set up that part of the project, we're pretty happy about. So I give -- Ray and his team connected to the commercial side of it, that's the important part that we're trying to emphasize today that it's not just engineers picking [indiscernible] there's a connectivity that has to occur between those that makes the project better.  So even in an example, and I know you're thinking, hey, it's a good number. We actually had a case that was a lower number, higher OpEx, and we went with this case because we thought it was a better long term to have that OpEx lower. And like I said, the technology and the sustainability and the carbon output of it, I think, has turned out to be really good. So we're happy to disclose it. And offline, we can give a little bit more color around some of those details.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. And Mike, my follow-up question, obviously, here is when you took over, the focus kind of changed internally to optimization, cost cuts and everything is falling in place. I mean you're almost generating $1 billion post dividend free cash on a quarterly basis. So I'm just trying to understand, when you start looking at this kind of cash level buildup, even with your buybacks, like what's the -- like what is the optimum debt level? Or is this a dry powder where you could actually go out and make a strategic acquisition at some point given the way the cash is building on the balance sheet now?\nMichael Hennigan: So I'll let Mary talk about the balance sheet and debt, obviously, an important part, but I'll give you a big picture look, is part of the way we looked at this business is we want all of our assets to generate free cash. So you're pointing out something that we've been working on over the last couple of years. You make portfolio adjustments, you adjust commercial activity, do all those things so that you end up in a position where we like -- where we are right now.  And it was mentioned earlier, we haven't abandoned the dividend. We've kind of put that a little on hold as we return a lot of capital via share buybacks. But I'm still a big believer in you got to be in this position, so you got to put the business in this position so that you can then have really good discussions about return of capital and return on capital.  We do want to grow the business. We've been very selective in where we're going to put some of that money and we'll continue to be that way. And when we are selective, we'll have cash that we'll return to shareholders. When we are selective, and we think we have a good investment, we're going to put it there. And we're going to continue to challenge all of our teams to tie the technical side of this business to the commercial side of this business, such that at the end of the day, we put ourselves in a position where we have the choices that you're talking about.  So we have some thoughts going forward. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but at the same time, I'm happy that the team has embraced the concept, the philosophical concept of putting ourselves in a position where all assets contribute free cash, will generate that -- as you know, I've said many, many times, we don't control the market. So we're a pricetaker in a large part of refining. So that will make some of our business volatile.  And then we want to have the balance sheet in a good position as well. So I don't know if Mary wants to comment on that. But at the end of the day, I think you pointed out the good end game, which is generate a lot of cash in the business, have some flexibility and then make some good decisions on what's the best way to create value.\nMaryann Mannen: It's Maryann. I'll just add maybe a few additional comments. We've been looking over the last several quarters and talking about the balance sheet. We continue to say that, that investment-grade profile for us is critically important. That means we need to stay in and around gross debt-to-capital range of about 30%. We're below that, as I shared with you today. But keep in mind, we've got $9.5 billion of share repurchase remaining and all other things being consistent as we continue to do that share repurchase, right?  We'll see that ratio improve. We've done quite a bit of work to ensure we've got the right liquidity. We'll sit with $1 billion on the balance sheet, which is somewhat lower than we had initially contemplated a few quarters ago and we think that's certainly a positive step. Mike already mentioned that returning to the more, I'll say, normal capital structure. We have outlined our capital priorities, obviously, sustaining capital, the dividend being important and then we'll use share repurchase opportunistically to return that capital as we see the outlook for 2020. I hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Gresh: First question, just one clarification on Neil's question around the RVO piece. Maryann, I think you said $62 million per quarter. So that -- so would I multiply that by 4 in terms of what showed up in the fourth quarter specifically? And then my real question just around your comments on maintenance being a bit more back-end loaded. I was hoping you could remind us what a normal maintenance level would be per year and/or if you're willing to comment, just if you have an annual number that we can be thinking about? .\nMaryann Mannen: Yes, sure, of course. So let me be clear, the $62 million that I referred to is the annual adjustment for 2021 compliance year. So the $62 million is total adjustment or reduction, if you will, to our obligation for all of 2021. If you think about the impact on that on the capture rate in the quarter, so we were about 116. That's about 1.7 change in the capture rate, including all $62 million. My comment on a quarterly basis was just to say that it's fairly ratable. So had -- we had that RVO obligation at the beginning of the year, you would have seen roughly a $15 million benefit to the prior quarters. That's all that I was trying to say. I hope that answers that question. The second one is really around turnaround. And I guess what we would say is, yes, absolutely back half of the year, we see a greater rating, if you will, toward our turnaround expenses. We see this year, meaning 2022, slightly higher than a normal year. We tend to think normal is in range of $600 million to $700 million, as you saw from what we had this year. So we do expect that to be a higher total for 2022. I'll let Mike add any comments.\nMichael Hennigan: No, I don't have anything to add.\nPhilip Gresh: Okay. Great. No, that's very helpful. My second one, just on the buybacks. Obviously, the pace in 4Q has essentially tripled from the 2Q, 3Q run rate. And with the increase in the authorization, recognizing it doesn't have a specific end date, is there any reason to think that the new run rate that you've been doing is not achievable or doable on a go-forward basis? Or anything in particular about the fourth quarter that you would say is nonrepeatable? .\nMaryann Mannen: It's Maryann. I'd say, look, we'll look at liquidity. We certainly, as you know, committed. We were on our third quarter earnings call, to changing the cadence and hopefully, that we've demonstrated our ability to do so in the third quarter -- so from our third quarter performance. We'll absolutely look at liquidity. And as I said, we remain committed to getting that done in 2022 and given the pace that we've achieved, we're likely to be able to get that done sooner. And again, I'm talking about the $10 billion initial commitment.\nOperator: We do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotia Bank.\nPaul Cheng: Question, I think one is just maybe a bit of the housekeeping. I want to follow up to Maryann's answer to Neil earlier. You talked about the RVO adjustment benefit and the LCFS adjustment. Can you give us what is the benefit from the crew timing benefit and also the inventory benefit by region? So that's just a quick follow-up here. Second question is for Mike, from a commercial operation, I mean when you look back into your earlier, in your carrier, in Sunoco 20-some-odd years ago. I mean that's your pick. And when you're looking at that in the longer term, so when you look at that operation primarily to facilitate the rest of the refining and how the operation -- and MPLX operation? Or that should we also look at it as a profit center, like the model above by BP, Shell, Total, those guys. I mean, what do you envision that business really going to do? And what have already accomplished and where you think is the biggest opportunity with the potential improvement or upside that you still envision from that business over the next 1 or 2 years?\nMichael Hennigan: So I'll start with your second part and I'll let Mary go back to the first part. So to answer your question, Paul, it's both. It's -- yes, it should be a separate profit center for us. Rick, Brian and the team are very committed to that. You heard some examples earlier. So that's a stand-alone. And then the other part of it is connectivity to the whole business, making sure the commercial and the portfolio side are totally in sync. So the answer is really both. You have to do both really, really well.  Again, when I started this by saying portfolio cost and commercial, they're all linked, and they all have an obligation across the supply chain. So that's one obligation, and then they all have to do excellence in their own regard. So the commercial area needs to do excellence in just the commercial area. Ray's team needs to do excellence, like I was saying earlier about picking that technology at the end of the day. That's something that goes across both and then have some excellence inside of it.  So the answer -- the short answer to your question is both. Like I said earlier, I'm trying to give you some examples of how we're approaching it. Trying not to go into too much detail, but just to give you a little bit more of the philosophy. So hopefully, that helps, and then I'll let Mary talk on the first part.\nPaul Cheng: And Mike, can I just ask one question on that approach? Is your commercial operation going to be a centralized commercial operation or it be centralized? In other words, that is the trade by refinery that they're going to do on the final or the day-to-day adjustment in terms of the operation or that you have a centralized team to coordinate all the effort, which approach that you guys are picking? .\nMichael Hennigan: Yes. Again, the answer is both. We have -- part of our commercial team is dedicated to the supply chain and what we're doing, and then part of it is more entrepreneurial and trying to look at it in a little bit different regards. So I think both still the right answer. .\nPaul Cheng: Maryann, sorry.\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. No, no worries at all. Yes, unfortunately, we really do not provide those inventory movements quarter-to-quarter on a regional basis. So not disclosed, and it's not actually something that we would typically share. .\nPaul Cheng: Can I ask that on the appendix, Page 22 on your presentation, you saw a capture impact of 597, we can identify based on the RVO and the LCFS roughly 100. So the other 500 on the total sum, is that primarily driven by the favorable inventory impact and the crude timing? Or I mean you have not break down by region, can you share that what is the total system on those 2 benefits? .\nMaryann Mannen: Paul, it's Maryann. Maybe we can take that offline and address all of your questions specifically. Would that be helpful? .\nPaul Cheng: Yes, that would be great.\nMaryann Mannen: Sounds good.\nMichael Hennigan: And Paul, the only thing that I would add is, again, watch quarterly results, there's always timing from Q3 into Q4, Q4 into Q1. Some of that occurred here. And like I said, Mary can give you a little bit more offline and Kristina and the team. But just be careful when you look at 1 quarter isolate it, that tends to get a little bit misaligned if there was activity across the quarters. So just keep that in mind when you guys have the discussion.\nKristina Kazarian: All right, Sheila? Operator, are you still there?\nOperator: That was all the time that we had for questions for today.\nKristina Kazarian: Perfect. Well, thank you so much, everyone, for joining our call this afternoon. If you have any questions that you didn't get addressed on the call today, the Investors Relations team is available any time, please just reach out. Thank you again.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Partee",
            "content": "Yes, sure. This is Brian. Great question. So I think the short answer is too early to tell, but I think you're on to it. Maryann mentioned in her prepared comments, the volatility we've seen in natural gas over the last several months. We've gone from $3 gas to $6 down to $4, now we're peaking back up to 5. So directionally, yes, very supportive relative to the cheap natural gas position we have that we believe is certainly sustainable over the long term in The U.S. But ultimately, these are long-term decisions for anybody that has that exposure overseas to higher natural gas prices. But yes, directionally, we do see it as supportive. It's just a little bit too early to tell. But if we stay in this $5 to $6 gas range, it will absolutely put pressure on those that have that exposure, and we'll look for upside. But it's one of many variables. Yes. No, from an import perspective, not yet. I mean, that's one thing that we're looking at, both the fundamental balance in the Atlantic Basin looking at opportunities to actually export into Europe. But the ARPS has been pretty stable. No big immediate changes here in the short term, but we're watching it very closely. Yes, Neil, thanks for the question. This is Brian. So just commercially, we are hyper-focused on optimization and improvement. I think we've been pretty transparent and clear about that as one of our 3 key strategic initiatives. So just a bit of color. The Gulf Coast was an area here over the last quarter where we saw some nice, marked improvements in our operations commercially that help to drive a better capture.  Really fundamentally, what's helping with that for us and our business is better alignment of the team. We're getting the right resources and getting them focused in the right areas and aligned efficiently. In a couple of examples, in the Gulf Coast, just highlighting that as an example, it's really helping us drive our marketing book and our growth in and along the Gulf Coast.  And then our export expansion as well. We've been really focused on our expansion of our export book. And specific to our export book, we're really focused on more delivered cargoes. So we're moving further down the value chain, higher margin capture. So we've had a lot of success in growing that line of our business.  And then lastly, we did take in a position in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter that allows us to optimize supply both internationally and domestically, particularly into Florida as well as developing blending program in and along the Caribbean. So I just wanted to provide some color and some examples of things that we're doing to help advance our commercial initiatives."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michael Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, and thanks for joining our call.  Before we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment. During the fourth quarter, despite the widespread surge in Omicron variant cases, gasoline demand held up well. And on diesel, we're seeing highway trucking volumes continuing to meet or exceed seasonal records. While jet demand reached post-pandemic highs in the fourth quarter, it's still roughly 15% below 2019 levels as business travel remains suppressed, but we expect to see recovery in that this year as well.  When we spoke with you in November, we were cautious about rising COVID cases this winter and the potential impact. Based on the trends over the last few months, we've become less concerned about the pace of recovery in transportation fuels demand. Light product inventories remain tight and U.S. demand continues to recover. We believe that refining margins will be well positioned for 2022.  On the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we made continued progress on our priorities. Since our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we've repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares. That puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion share repurchase program. Further reinforcing our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we obtained board approval for an additional $5 billion in share repurchase authorization. This brings our total outstanding authorization to approximately $9.5 billion.  Today, we announced our 2022 capital spending outlook. We expect MPC will have approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, with approximately 50% of the $1.3 billion growth capital for our Martinez refinery conversion. Total costs for the Martinez refinery conversion is estimated at $1.2 billion. Approximately $300 million has been spent to date, $700 million for 2022 and $200 million for 2023. This competitive capital cost is driven by the fact that Martinez' assets are conducive to retrofit, and we can leverage existing infrastructure and logistics.  At Martinez, the project reached another milestone as a 60-day comment period for the Environmental Impact Report concluded on December 17, 2021. We remain committed to progressing the conversion to a renewable fuels facility, engineering is complete and we're ready to begin construction. Our plan is to have the first phase start-up in the second half of '22.  We've already sourced some advantaged feedstocks for the Martinez facility and are engaged in negotiations with multiple parties for the balance. Our strategy is multifaceted, including long-term arrangements, joint ventures and alliances, all of which are common in this space. A recent example of our success would be our joint venture with ADM. We're also leveraging existing capabilities that are currently supporting Dickinson to optimize between the 2 facilities. We remain confident in our progress and ability to secure feedstocks for Martinez.  On Kenai, we have been working at sales process since we last communicated. We'll be back to you when we have additional details that we can share. In 2021, we progressed all 3 of our strategic initiatives, and Slide 4 highlights this execution. On the portfolio, we completed the Speedway sale, receiving $17.2 billion of proceeds from that transaction and securing the 15-year fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven. Our Dickinson renewable diesel facility started up, reached capacity, and we've been successfully optimizing the operation. We made 2 strategic decisions to idle our Gallup refinery and to convert Martinez to a renewable fuels facility. And this year, MPLX produced exceptionally strong cash flow, which provided $2.2 billion of contributions to MPC.  As we look at cost reduction, what began as a $1.5 billion cost-reduction initiative is being embraced by the organization and now a low-cost culture is becoming embedded in how we conduct our business.  Finally, on commercial. While I've been reluctant to share too much, I wanted to highlight a few items that have commercial significance in our portfolio. In March of 2021, we started up the Beatrice pretreatment facility, which processes about 3,000 barrels a day of advantaged feedstock for the Dickinson renewable diesel plan. In December, we closed on a joint venture with ADM, which will provide approximately 5,000 barrels a day of logistically advantaged feedstock for Dickinson when the new soybean crush plant comes online in 2023.  And in January of this year, we successfully started up our Cincinnati pretreatment facility, which will process about 2,000 barrels per day for our Dickinson renewable diesel plant. We converted this facility from its original configuration as a biodiesel plant.  Our team's execution on these 3 strategic priorities builds a foundation for continued value creation and we look forward to sharing updates each quarter as we continue to advance these initiatives.  Shifting to Slide 5. We remain focused on challenging ourselves to leading in sustainable energy. We have 3 company-wide targets on GHG, methane and freshwater intensity than many of our investors and stakeholders know well. In the coming weeks, we look forward to providing an update on our progress against these targets and some of our accomplishments in 2021.  At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann to review the fourth quarter results. Doug, it's Mike. Let me just add a little bit to Mary's comments. One of the things that I think may be getting misconstrued is we are still committed to the dividend, as Mary just said. However, we're in a little bit of a different situation than normal operating cash flow. I mean we're sitting with about $11 billion on the balance sheet in a large return program. And as you just saw, we did about $3 billion since the last call.  So as far as order of magnitude, we're committed to returning capital. But right now, the size of the share repurchase relative to the dividend is just out of proportion until we get to a more normal balance sheet. So I don't want people to think we're not committed to the dividend. We are going to evaluate it, as Mary just said. But right now, we're putting a lot of the effort in the return into the buyback program. I hope that helps. Doug, it's Mike. Let me -- I'm going to put that over to Brian on products and Rick on crude to give you a little bit of color. It's a good question. Obviously, that dynamic is occurring in Europe. So why don't you start, Brian? Ray, can you give a Martinez update? Yes, Prashant, it's Mike. I just want to add a little bit more color to what Ray said. So if you back up, the way I've looked at this project from the beginning is do we have competitive CapEx? Do we have competitive OpEx and logistics and ultimately, feedstock to make it work? So Ray has just talked a little bit about the CapEx, and we finally have disclosed that number. Part of the reason I wanted to explain that we hadn't disclosed it up until this point is because we've been working the feedstock side of the business pretty detailed and that's still in progress. So hopefully, we'll give more updates as time goes by. But we're at a point as we've negotiated with a lot of different counterparties that we felt comfortable now that we can disclose the CapEx because that's been part of all the discussions and all the negotiations that have occurred on that side of the ledger. So I think us disclosing that now, Ray, trying to give you a little bit more feel for -- we put some CapEx in that we believe is going to give us lower operating expenses over time. And I think the whole puzzle is kind of coming together is the way we thought of the project: competitive CapEx, competitive OpEx, good logistics, as Ray just mentioned. And then like I said, we're still working on that feedstock side, but we're pretty far along in what we're trying to accomplish there. Yes, Prashant, it's Mike. I'll start off and then I'll let Brian or Ray jump in if they'd like to. One of the things people have asked me about, can you talk a little bit about commercial stuff. And I've tried not to go into a lot of detail there. But the point you're making has got a little bit of portfolio and a little bit of commercial side to it. Long term, I think the point you're making is markets equilibrate and you'll see some competitiveness and we agree with that. It's part of the reason that we stress test Martinez.  But in the short term, we've got Dickinson up and running and you got to be fast in this business. You got to be quick. And I think what you're seeing through the team effort here because it's our portfolio and it's part commercial was to get this Beatrice plant up and running, get 3,000 barrels a day of really advantaged feedstock there, get a couple of thousand barrels a day of converting the biodiesel plant.  So it's partly the portfolio or the engineering team working with the commercial team. To your point, right at the moment, those feedstocks are advantaged and getting pretreated. Long term, you're right. The competitiveness will change over time. There will be more equilibrium. But at the same time, as Ray talked about, we felt having full pretreatment at Martinez was still going to be a good thing for us in the long term.  And the technology that we pick there, so there's a lot of important thoughts from an engineering and technical side that also married to what we want to try and achieve commercially. And like I said, hopefully, we'll be able to give you a little bit more color on feedstock as time goes by. But we felt it was a good enough time to explain what the CapEx number is and how we're feeling about it. Yes, Neil, I'm going to add, but it looks like Brian wants to jump in and want to comment, and then I'll finish up. And Neil, it's Mike. One of the things -- happy with the progress that Brian and the team are making in some of those areas. But I do want to stay on the record that I'm not a big fan of this metric. I've said that many, many times. And the main reason is because there's other things that can drive the metric in different directions. The spread between light products and heavy products is the most dominant feature in it.  And I just want to remind people that you can have a low capture rate if you're still making a lot of money or you could have a high capture rate and not be making as much. So you got to be a little careful or you got to dig into the details because the metric itself has some flaws. Now with that said, am I glad that we're making incremental progress? Sure. I think all things being equal, we want to see the number up higher than not.  But I just keep want to caution, Kristina is tired of me saying this to her all the time that there's other factors that influence that metric that can mislead or misalign some of the activities going on. But overall, as Mary said and Brian said, good things happen should drive that in the right direction. But I just want to keep putting that caution out.  I'm still challenging Kristina and our team to come up with a better way to do it. We haven't come up with that yet, but we're working on it because I think we may be able to come up with something that might be a little better. But in the meantime, I know everybody tracks this one and is used to looking at it. So it is what it is, and I just wanted to make sure I had that caution on it. Yes, Neil, it's a good question. It is still a little early. What I was saying earlier is we're still actively engaged in some feedstock discussions. So we can't go to that disclosure. We got to the point with our discussions that capital is now very open with everybody, so we thought we could disclose it. So that's where we are in the process. You saw in our prepared remarks, we have secured some feedstock. We're still in some discussions, but still a little premature.  But we were thinking that we could at least put the capital out there and that would give some color to some of the questions that people have been asking us. And I know it's taken a little bit of time, but part of it is we couldn't disclose it while we were still in some level of those negotiations. Now that we're past that, we can disclose that piece, but we still have some activity going on. Yes, Roger, it's a good question. What I'm trying to say is the metric can be driven by different factors other than what we're doing than things we have control of. Brian was mentioning some of the things that we have control of that we think are increasing our commercial capture. What I was trying to say, sometimes the spreads themselves can drive that metric in a different direction.  So the only thing I was trying to say is the metric itself has some good parts to it. It has some bad parts to it. And you usually have to drill down to really understand what's happening. Now like I just said, I'm happy with the commercial team making progress. For apples-to-apples, we want to see that number higher. But I just want to continue to caution people that there's some flaws in the metric or some other things that drive it, just like Mary said in her remarks.  So part of, like you said, cost and everything that we're doing on that side, is still a high focus. We have a lot of focus, as Brian said, on the commercial side of the business, trying to be a little reluctant to give a lot of details in that regard because of the competitive nature of it, but also listening to people saying, \"Hey, can you give me some color what's going on there? So we tried to pick a few examples that we could give you a little bit of the way we're thinking about it. And hoping it helps, but I'll leave it there. Yes, Roger, it's Mike. I'll take that again. I would say, in general, you're referring to that we made a change at the CCO level. I do want to say, Brian was a contributor this year. He's a nice guy and a very smart guy. And commercial team has been doing some really good stuff. But ultimately, we weren't in sync on philosophy and expectations, so I thought a change was necessary.  But I don't want to diminish the progress that the team has made. I don't want to diminish Rick and Brian who are on the call here today and their teams are -- I love Brian's word, hyperfocused. I was glad to hear that. We think there is opportunity for us in this area. And like I said, we had a little bit of philosophical and expectation differences that I just thought it was -- is warranted to make a change rather than try and get that back on track. It was warranted to make a change.  But I'm happy with the progress that's been occurring. I think we have clear line of sight of some other opportunities for us. I know we frustrate people by not giving a lot of detail there, but hopefully, you'll just continue to see it in results, and we'll try to think of ways and opportunities that we can explain some things that will help you guys understand the business from our perspective a little better. And Manav, it's Mike. I just want to reemphasize something that's important and give Ray and his team some credit for. I mean, at the end of the day, we spend a lot of time thinking about this CapEx. And ultimately, to your point, it's a good number, but we actually had a lower capital case that we thought would have a higher operating expense, as Ray mentioned. And we chose to spend a little more capital.  So trying to bring a little more commerciality into the decision to assist the technical side of it, I think, has played out really well for us. Ray hasn't talked a lot about it, but the technology that we picked there was very important. And offline, we can talk to you a little bit about that, but that's a very important part of how this project has played itself out, choosing to go a little higher on CapEx even though it's a pretty good rate, just so that we get lower OpEx.  It was an important part of the discussion. The sustainability of the project and the way we set up that part of the project, we're pretty happy about. So I give -- Ray and his team connected to the commercial side of it, that's the important part that we're trying to emphasize today that it's not just engineers picking [indiscernible] there's a connectivity that has to occur between those that makes the project better.  So even in an example, and I know you're thinking, hey, it's a good number. We actually had a case that was a lower number, higher OpEx, and we went with this case because we thought it was a better long term to have that OpEx lower. And like I said, the technology and the sustainability and the carbon output of it, I think, has turned out to be really good. So we're happy to disclose it. And offline, we can give a little bit more color around some of those details. So I'll let Mary talk about the balance sheet and debt, obviously, an important part, but I'll give you a big picture look, is part of the way we looked at this business is we want all of our assets to generate free cash. So you're pointing out something that we've been working on over the last couple of years. You make portfolio adjustments, you adjust commercial activity, do all those things so that you end up in a position where we like -- where we are right now.  And it was mentioned earlier, we haven't abandoned the dividend. We've kind of put that a little on hold as we return a lot of capital via share buybacks. But I'm still a big believer in you got to be in this position, so you got to put the business in this position so that you can then have really good discussions about return of capital and return on capital.  We do want to grow the business. We've been very selective in where we're going to put some of that money and we'll continue to be that way. And when we are selective, we'll have cash that we'll return to shareholders. When we are selective, and we think we have a good investment, we're going to put it there. And we're going to continue to challenge all of our teams to tie the technical side of this business to the commercial side of this business, such that at the end of the day, we put ourselves in a position where we have the choices that you're talking about.  So we have some thoughts going forward. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but at the same time, I'm happy that the team has embraced the concept, the philosophical concept of putting ourselves in a position where all assets contribute free cash, will generate that -- as you know, I've said many, many times, we don't control the market. So we're a pricetaker in a large part of refining. So that will make some of our business volatile.  And then we want to have the balance sheet in a good position as well. So I don't know if Mary wants to comment on that. But at the end of the day, I think you pointed out the good end game, which is generate a lot of cash in the business, have some flexibility and then make some good decisions on what's the best way to create value. No, I don't have anything to add. So I'll start with your second part and I'll let Mary go back to the first part. So to answer your question, Paul, it's both. It's -- yes, it should be a separate profit center for us. Rick, Brian and the team are very committed to that. You heard some examples earlier. So that's a stand-alone. And then the other part of it is connectivity to the whole business, making sure the commercial and the portfolio side are totally in sync. So the answer is really both. You have to do both really, really well.  Again, when I started this by saying portfolio cost and commercial, they're all linked, and they all have an obligation across the supply chain. So that's one obligation, and then they all have to do excellence in their own regard. So the commercial area needs to do excellence in just the commercial area. Ray's team needs to do excellence, like I was saying earlier about picking that technology at the end of the day. That's something that goes across both and then have some excellence inside of it.  So the answer -- the short answer to your question is both. Like I said earlier, I'm trying to give you some examples of how we're approaching it. Trying not to go into too much detail, but just to give you a little bit more of the philosophy. So hopefully, that helps, and then I'll let Mary talk on the first part. Yes. Again, the answer is both. We have -- part of our commercial team is dedicated to the supply chain and what we're doing, and then part of it is more entrepreneurial and trying to look at it in a little bit different regards. So I think both still the right answer. . And Paul, the only thing that I would add is, again, watch quarterly results, there's always timing from Q3 into Q4, Q4 into Q1. Some of that occurred here. And like I said, Mary can give you a little bit more offline and Kristina and the team. But just be careful when you look at 1 quarter isolate it, that tends to get a little bit misaligned if there was activity across the quarters. So just keep that in mind when you guys have the discussion."

            "name": "Raymond Brooks",
            "content": "Yes, sure. Thanks for that question. And if I start talking about Martinez and before I get into the CapEx, I kind of want to talk about where we're at with the project in regards to permitting. And so as we covered before, we completed the public comment period in December. And right now, over the last 1.5 months, we've been working really hard with the [indiscernible] to address all questions and get the permit to the finish line. And so we're really targeting the end of Q1 to have the sequel permit done and be ready to put shovels in the ground.  And with that, what I want to emphasize is we're absolutely ready to do that. Our engineering is complete for the first phase. It's nearly complete for the backup few phases. We have the equipment on site. We have the pipe, we have the pilings. We have the vessels that we need to do this project. So we're ready from that standpoint.  Now as far as what's in the project, I've talked a lot over the past couple of calls about why Martinez makes sense. And I've talked about 3 hydroprocessing units, 2 hydrogen plants. I've talked about the Cogen power generation on site. As far as what we're spending the money on, what I want to emphasize is a couple of key things in that regard. One is pretreatment. This project is really driven by -- we want to be able to process all the renewable feedstocks, and we want to be able to pretreat them ourselves.  So we've invested in pretreatment capabilities. We're really excited about the technology that we've chosen. We feel it is a good technology that we're spending money on that will have a lower CapEx, have sustainability advantages. So we feel good about that. And then the other thing I want to emphasize is we're investing a lot in logistics. Why Martinez? Martinez has scale, Martinez has optionality. And so we have optionality on truck, rail, pipe and water as far as bringing feedstocks in and products out. So I just wanted to give a little bit of color on, hey, what we're spending money on in 2022. Manav, this is Ray. Let me take another shot at talking about Martinez and your math is right. It's about $1.60 a capacity gallon for that, which we feel good about compared to the industry and why we are excited about this project. As far as why that's the case, it gets back to the toolkit that's already sitting there at Martinez, 3 hydrocrackers, hydro treaters, 2 hydrogen plants and a Cogen facility.  So what we're investing, the big thing that's new is investing in the pretreat system. The rest that we're doing is we're investing a lot in connectivity, piping to get all those units to go to the right places and logistics from that standpoint. So largely, the reconfiguring of Martinez allowed us to have a very capital-efficient project."

            "name": "Maryann Mannen",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.27 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.30. Adjusted earnings exclude $132 million of pretax charges related to make-whole premiums for the $2.1 billion in senior notes we redeemed in December. Additionally, the adjustments include an incremental $112 million of tax expense, which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate.  Beginning with our first quarter 2022 results, we will be reporting our effective tax rate on an actual basis and will no longer adjust our actual results to a 24% tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $400 million higher from the prior quarter. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $2 billion, which is an increase of almost $300 million from the prior quarter.  Finally, during the quarter, we returned $354 million to shareholders through dividend payments and approximately $2.7 billion in share repurchases. In the 3 months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares.  Slide 7 illustrates the progress we have made towards lowering our cost structure over the past 2 years. As we think about our strategy on cost structure, I want to emphasize a few things. We will never compromise the safety of employees or the integrity of our assets. And we are committed to ensure the current cost reductions are sustainable, even during periods of general cost pressures.  Since the beginning of 2020, we have been able to maintain roughly $1.5 billion of cost reductions that have been taken out of the company's total cost. Refining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion. Our refining operating costs in 2020 began at $6 per barrel. While we were able to finish 2021 with a full year operating cost per barrel that was $5. Additionally, midstream was reduced by $400 million and corporate cost by about $100 million.  However, regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion. This improvement is expected to make the company more resilient in future downcycles, while having more bottom line profitability and upcycles.  Turning to Slide 8. We would like to highlight our financial priorities for 2022. First, sustaining capital as we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Second, we're committed to the dividend. As we continue to purchase shares, we will reduce the share count and increase the potential of returnable cash flow.  Third, we continue to believe this is both a return on and return of capital business and we will continue to invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. In traditional refining, we're focused on investments that are resilient and reduce cost. In renewables, current spend is primarily focused on our Martinez renewable fuel conversion. We believe that share repurchases can be used to meaningfully return capital to shareholders.  In order to successfully execute the strategies guided by these priorities, MPC needs a strong balance sheet as a foundation. We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade credit profile.  Moving to another key focus area. Slide 9 highlights our focus on strict capital discipline. Today, we announced our 2022 capital outlook for MPC. MPC's 2022 capital investment plan totals approximately $1.7 billion. As we continue to focus on strict capital discipline, our overall spend remains approximately 30% below 2019 spending levels. Sustaining capital is approximately 20% of capital spend, underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance.  Of the remaining 80% for growth, approximately 50% of this $1.3 billion supports the conversion of Martinez into a renewable fuels facility. The remainder of the growth capital is for other projects already underway. At our refineries, the growth capital is primarily for projects that enhance returns at MPC's large coastal assets with a focus on completing Galveston Bay STAR project as well as smaller projects at Garyville and Los Angeles. Going forward, we expect growth capital will continue to have a significant portion for renewables and projects that will help us reduce future operating cost.  Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by a $354 million increase from Refining & Marketing. The adjustment column reflects $132 million of pretax charges for make-whole premiums for debt redemption during the quarter, which has also been excluded from the interest column.  Moving to our segment results. Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. The business reported continued improvement from last quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion. Fourth quarter EBITDA increased $354 million when compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins in the U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast regions.  U.S. Gulf Coast production increased by 14%, recovering from storm-related downtime last quarter and solid margin per barrel increased 31% due to higher export sales and higher sales of light product inventory. The West Coast margin per barrel increased 40% associated with increased demand and refinery outages. Utilization was 94% for the quarter, slightly improved from the third quarter. The higher Gulf Coast throughput was offset by lower throughput in the Mid-Con for planned turnaround activity.  Operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. There was also higher routine maintenance and planned project expense. Additionally, we saw natural gas prices softened during the quarter, coming off highs in the $5 to $6 range and ending in the $3 to $4 range.  Slide 12 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2021. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter.  Slide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $2 billion in the quarter. This excludes changes in working capital and also excludes the cash we received for our CARES tax refund in the quarter, which was approximately $1.6 billion source of cash and is included in the income tax part of the chart. Working capital was an approximate $1.3 billion source of cash this quarter, driven primarily by reduction in crude and product inventory.  As we announced on last quarter's call, MPC redeemed $2.1 billion in senior notes in December. Under income taxes, we received approximately $1.6 billion of our CARES tax refund in the fourth quarter. We also used about $300 million to offset against our Speedway tax obligation. There is about $60 million of the refund remaining, which we expect in the first half of 2022. We paid approximately $1.2 billion for our Speedway income tax obligation. All that remains is about $50 million of state and local taxes.  With respect to capital return during the quarter, MPC returned $354 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $2.7 billion worth of shares. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $10.8 billion in cash and short-term investments.  Slide 14 provides our capital investment plan for 2022 which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.7 billion. The plan includes $1.6 billion for Refining & Marketing segment, of which approximately $300 million or roughly 20% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance spending.  Our growth capital plan is approximately $1.3 billion, split between renewables and ongoing projects. Within renewable spending, the majority is allocated for the Martinez conversion. Ongoing projects in our Refining & Marketing segment will enhance the capability of our refining assets, particularly in the Gulf Coast and also support our focus on growing the value recognized from our Marathon and ARCO marketing brands.  Also included is approximately $100 million of corporate spending to support activities we believe will enhance our ability to lower future costs and capture commercial value.  This morning, MPLX also announced their 2022 capital investment plan of $900 million. Their plan includes approximately $700 million of growth capital, $140 million of maintenance capital and $60 million for the repayment of their share of the Bakken Pipeline joint venture's debt due in 2022.  On Slide 15, we review our progress on our return of capital. Since our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of company shares. This puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion repurchase program commitment, leaving approximately $4.5 billion remaining. We remain committed to complete the $10 billion program by the end of 2022. And as we are ahead of pace given our recent repurchases, could foresee completion sooner than initially planned.  As part of our long-term commitment to return capital, we announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization today, increasing our recent repurchase authorizations to $15 billion. We plan to continue using open market repurchase programs, although all of the programs we have previously discussed remain available to us to complete our commitment. We intend to use programs that allow us to buy on an ongoing basis, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings call.  As we have said many times, we believe a strong balance sheet is essential to being successful in a competitive commodity business. It's the foundation allowing us to execute our strategy. Slide 16 highlights some of the key points about our balance sheet.  MPC ended the year with approximately $10.8 billion of cash and short-term investments. But longer term, we believe that we will need to maintain about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Additionally, we will always ensure that we have enough liquidity to endure market fluctuations.  Currently, we have a $5 billion bank revolver that is undrawn. We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade profile. At year-end, MPC's gross debt-to-capital ratio is 21% and our long-term gross debt-to-capital target is approximately 30%. As we continue to execute our share repurchase program, we will see that ratio increase. After the recent redemption in December, our current structural debt is approximately $6.5 billion, and we do not have any maturities until 2024.  Turning to guidance. Slide 17, we provide our first quarterly outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.9 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $155 million in the first quarter. The majority of the activity will be in the Gulf Coast region. Our 2022 planned turnaround activity is back half-weighted this year.  Total operating costs are projected to be $5.10 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. So maybe a couple of things. First, as you've seen from the capital framework that we've been sharing this morning, the dividend obviously remains an important piece of the capital allocation strategy. As you look, you're right, as we continue to complete our capital program -- share repurchase program, the amount of capital that's allocated towards the dividend, obviously, will be declining. We think that's somewhere -- if you look at the current dividend versus where it's been, that's somewhere in the range of $200 million to $300 million right now.  We continue to think that share repurchase in the short term is an appropriate allocation of that. As we get to what we would consider to be a capital structure in a more normal environment, meaning we complete that share repurchase, we'll continue to evaluate the timing of any dividend change. But again, when you look at the difference in that dividend payment, we certainly think that we're providing that allocation in an appropriate manner. Neil, it's Maryann. Let me try to give you some color there, and then I'll pass it back to Mike. So I appreciate the comments. In the quarter, as you saw, about 116% capture overall. We had a couple of things happening in the quarter. One, in general, inventory was a tailwind for us this quarter. We have inventory impacts period-to-period. You can actually look at the third quarter as an example of that. Capture was about 100%. We benefited from crude timing impacts from running some advantage third quarter inventories purchased and we ran that in the fourth quarter. And we had some seasonally strong marketing margins. So historically, I think we have been talking about a baseline for our refining capture in and about a range of 95%. And while there's volatility in the quarter -- quarter-to-quarter, we're looking right now, we think, just based on this commercial execution that we've been talking about that our baseline is more like 100%.  I'll make a couple of comments, and then again, I'll pass it on to Mike, just something specific in the quarter. We did benefit in the fourth quarter from an adjustment $62 million for the full year adjustment for the 2021 RINs. That's pretty ratable quarter-by-quarter, so 1/4 of that belongs in the quarter. And we also did see a benefit of about $39 million for the Dickinson LCFS adjustment for lower CI in the quarter. So there are a few things that benefited the quarter overall. And I'll pass it back to Mike. One other small add to make, maybe as you're thinking about that cost and sustainability -- the sustainability of the cost reductions, keep in mind that as we are in the middle of this Martinez conversion, there are current operating costs included in that capture rate that you're seeing now. So those operating costs to complete the conversion, the day-to-day operating costs are already embedded in that capture rate as you're seeing it today. It's Maryann. I'll just add maybe a few additional comments. We've been looking over the last several quarters and talking about the balance sheet. We continue to say that, that investment-grade profile for us is critically important. That means we need to stay in and around gross debt-to-capital range of about 30%. We're below that, as I shared with you today. But keep in mind, we've got $9.5 billion of share repurchase remaining and all other things being consistent as we continue to do that share repurchase, right?  We'll see that ratio improve. We've done quite a bit of work to ensure we've got the right liquidity. We'll sit with $1 billion on the balance sheet, which is somewhat lower than we had initially contemplated a few quarters ago and we think that's certainly a positive step. Mike already mentioned that returning to the more, I'll say, normal capital structure. We have outlined our capital priorities, obviously, sustaining capital, the dividend being important and then we'll use share repurchase opportunistically to return that capital as we see the outlook for 2020. I hope that helps. Yes, sure, of course. So let me be clear, the $62 million that I referred to is the annual adjustment for 2021 compliance year. So the $62 million is total adjustment or reduction, if you will, to our obligation for all of 2021. If you think about the impact on that on the capture rate in the quarter, so we were about 116. That's about 1.7 change in the capture rate, including all $62 million. My comment on a quarterly basis was just to say that it's fairly ratable. So had -- we had that RVO obligation at the beginning of the year, you would have seen roughly a $15 million benefit to the prior quarters. That's all that I was trying to say. I hope that answers that question. The second one is really around turnaround. And I guess what we would say is, yes, absolutely back half of the year, we see a greater rating, if you will, toward our turnaround expenses. We see this year, meaning 2022, slightly higher than a normal year. We tend to think normal is in range of $600 million to $700 million, as you saw from what we had this year. So we do expect that to be a higher total for 2022. I'll let Mike add any comments. It's Maryann. I'd say, look, we'll look at liquidity. We certainly, as you know, committed. We were on our third quarter earnings call, to changing the cadence and hopefully, that we've demonstrated our ability to do so in the third quarter -- so from our third quarter performance. We'll absolutely look at liquidity. And as I said, we remain committed to getting that done in 2022 and given the pace that we've achieved, we're likely to be able to get that done sooner. And again, I'm talking about the $10 billion initial commitment. Yes. No, no worries at all. Yes, unfortunately, we really do not provide those inventory movements quarter-to-quarter on a regional basis. So not disclosed, and it's not actually something that we would typically share. . Paul, it's Maryann. Maybe we can take that offline and address all of your questions specifically. Would that be helpful? . Sounds good."

But with that being said, what we're seeing right now out of Europe is just slight run cuts at best because their margins are covering or higher up OpEx costs. So we haven't seen the impact substantially yet. If it continues, I think that's another story. So as Brian said, it's still a little bit too early to tell.  But then I'll also leave you with a couple of wild cards that we're watching closely, which could exasperate it as well in terms of nat gas costs. It's the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which we're all well aware of. And then ultimately, it's Nordstream 2 and what is the result that comes out of that. So a tailwind could get much better depending on how either 1 of these 2 plays out. It's just a little bit too early, Doug."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slides that acCompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO Maryann Mannen CFO, and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today, actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan : Thanks Kristina. Before we get into results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. Midway through the quarter, we were impacted by Hurricane Ida. The Ida hurricane passed over our Garyville refinery with wind speed topping 120 miles per hour. Fortunately, all of our employees in the region were safe but many of them experienced severe damage to their homes and the community around them. Our team was able to shut down our refinery in a controlled manner a day ahead of the storm and ensure operational integrity and safety of all of our employees. It took roughly a week to restore some power which enabled the first crude unit to restart over the next several days. The remainder of the refinery restarted sequentially over the next 10 days as more power became available to the facility. I'd like to recognize our refining team and our support groups for their dedication and efforts.  Our commercial teams also did an excellent job in keeping our customers in the region supplied through coordinated efforts across the Company. Maryann will cover this specific impacts when she reviews are refining results. In addition to the Louisiana Hurricane,our Los Angeles refinery with impacted by an earthquake on September 18th. Again, the major challenge was the loss of power. Once power was restored, the units were restarted, the refinery was back to normal operations in roughly 1 week. A gradual increase is in the demand for our products as mobility continue to recover. Globally, product inventories are at their tightest level in many years, and this improvement has lifted margins. In the U.S., gasoline and diesel inventories have steadily improved and are both at the low end of their 5-year averages. Jet fuel inventories have moved in at a 5-year range, although demand is still well below pre -pandemic levels, and we expect that to be a headwind for some time.  Our system is seeing gasoline demand currently 2% to 3% below 2019 levels with the West Coast still lagging at about 8% below. Diesel demand is now slightly above 2019 levels. Jet demand has improved, but still remains down nearly 15% to 20% below pre -pandemic levels. Natural gas costs steadily rose during the quarter, with an average increase of over $1 from the second to the third quarter. There's still some uncertainty as we head into the fourth quarter. But lower inventory levels and strong holiday travel could be supportive. And looking at next year of global products inventories remain tight and demand continues to recover, we would expect to refining sector to rebound in 2022. At the same time, we're watching prices to see if there is a consumer demand pull back. On the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we advanced several key initiatives. We progressed our renewables initiative with the addition of a new strategic partnership with ADM.  This JV will own and operate ADM's soybean processing complex in Spearwood, North Dakota. Upon completion which is expected in 2023, this facility will source and process local soybeans, supplying approximately 600 million pounds of soybean oil exclusively for MPC, enough feedstock for approximately 75 million gallons of renewable diesel per year. While this JV provides a locally advantaged feedstock for our Dickinson project, we continue to evaluate feedstock options for our Martinez facility in California. At Martinez, our renewable fuels facility conversion reached another project milestone when it's environmental impact report was issued for public comment in mid-October.  The process highlights our extensive effort working with the local regulators and other stakeholders. Also in October, United Airlines, Marathon and others conducted a successful test slate of a 737, which flew for 90 minutes using drop in sustainable aviation fuel. The SAF used during the test flight was 100% renewable drop in fuel made possible by proprietary technology from [Indiscernible] our wholly-owned subsidiary, which has a demonstration plant in Madison Wisconsin. And as we continue to focus on ways to strengthen the competitive position of our assets, today we announced that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for the Kenai refinery, which could include a potential sale.We often share our belief that our businesses both a return on and it return of capital business.  And this quarter we made progress strengthening our portfolio, continuing our low cost focus, and progressing our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. As of today, we've completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program. And we're confident in our ability to return the remaining $7.5 billion by the end of 2022. Finally, MPLX announced the Third Quarter distribution consisting of a 2.5% increase to its base distribution amount, and a special distribution amount as well. MPC will receive a total of $829 million. This announcement reinforces the strategic importance of MPLX as part of MPC 's portfolio, and its ability to return substantial cash to MPC and all unit holders. Slide 4 provides a framework around some of the ways we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. Our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social, and governments -- and governance or ESC dimensions of our operations.  It encompasses strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conserving natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies and embedding sustainability in decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders. We have 3 Company-wide targets many of our investors and stakeholders know well. First, a 30% reduction in our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030, second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025, and lastly, a 20% reduction in our freshwater withdrawal intensity by 2030. The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We have allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance two significant renewable fuels projects. In late 2020, we began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson North Dakota facility, the second largest of its kind in the U.S., and we're progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery through a renewable diesel facility. I'd also like to highlight a few specific updates from the quarter. We were recently awarded an ESG A rating by MSCI. We are the only U.S. based refiner that holds this rating. We continue to focus on enhancing our disclosures in this quarter, we also submitted data on our scope three emissions through CDP, and we're in the first in our refining sector to do so. We invite you to go to Sustainability section of our website and learn more about how we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review the Third Quarter results.\nMaryann Mannen : Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our third quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.09 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.73. Adjusted earnings exclude $48 million of pre -tax charges primarily related to Hurricane Ida impairments and idling costs. Additionally, the adjustments include an incremental $272 million of tax expense which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate. Our year-to-date effective rate is just under 2%. We therefore expect to retain the tax benefits realized in 2021. We will continue to make this tax rate adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $500 million higher from the prior quarter. Cash from operations excluding working capital and a voluntary pension contribution was nearly $1.8 billion, which is an increase of $230 million from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we paid $575 million into our pension plan.  We elected to contribute this additional amount as it was beneficial from a tax perspective. This amount covers nearly 3 years of estimated contributions and we forecast the plan would be fully funded at year-end. This also increased the Cares Act benefit to a total of $2.3 billion. Similar to last quarter, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business and capital commitments, as well as covered our dividend and distribution. Finally, we returned nearly $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases. Slide 6 illustrates the progress we have made towards lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020, we have taken almost $1.5 billion out of the Company's total costs. Refining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion, midstream reduced by $300 million, and corporate costs by about a $100 million. Regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion.  We continue to emphasize our safe, reliable, and low cost focus across the organization. While we do not see further cost reductions of the same magnitude that we have already taken out, there are still opportunities for us to reduce cost. Natural gas prices were higher in the Third Quarter and continue into the Fourth Quarter. For every $1 change in natural gas prices, we anticipate there is an approximate $360 million impact to annual EBITDA to our R&M segment. Based on current prices, we estimate that in the Fourth Quarter higher natural gas prices have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel. As we have previously mentioned, our refining cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021. As we continue -- and we continue to believe these are structural reductions.  While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, everyday we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate. As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities and in no way jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from Second Quarter 2021 to Third Quarter 2021. A djusted EBITDA was approximately $500 million higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by refining and marketing, but also benefiting from our strength in midstream. $48 million of pretax charges during the quarter are reflected in the adjustment column. Moving to our segment results, slide 8 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment.  The business reported continuing improvement from last quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion. This was an increase of $444 million when compared to the second quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refined margins, especially in the Gulf Coast region, as that regions cracks improved 34% from the second quarter. As Mike mentioned, our Garyville refinery was impacted by Hurricane Ida. We estimate the cost impact was $19 million this quarter, with an additional $11 million to be incurred in the Fourth Quarter. We estimate the lost opportunity from the hurricane to be approximately $80 million. The Garyville refinery was down for about 10 days and took another 10 days to ramp back up to full production. The throughput impact was approximately 8.3 million barrels.  We also believe there was an additional $10 million of lost opportunity impact associated with the earthquake at our Los Angeles refinery which was back to the planned rate after roughly one week. Utilization was 93% for the quarter, flat with the second quarter. We saw lower utilization in the Gulf Coast compared to the second quarter due to hurricane impacts. The Mid-Con region continued its strong utilization and West Coast strengthened as reopening in California continue to increase demand. If adjusted to include capacity which was idled in 2020, utilization would have been approximately 88% in the third quarter of 2021. Operating expenses were higher in the third quarter, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. Slide 9 shows the change in our midstream EBITDA versus the Second Quarter of 2021.  Our midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. The strong cash flow profile and lower capital spending supported the decision to return more cash to unit holders. Today MPLX announced a 2.5% increase in the partnership's base quarterly distribution, and a special distribution amount of approximately $600 million. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter our midstream assets in the region were also impacted by Hurricane Ida. We estimate the cost impact was $4 million this quarter, with an additional $7 million to be incurred in the Fourth Quarter. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Operating cash flow was $1,765,000,000 in the quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, this excludes changes in working capital and an incremental payment of approximately $575 million into our pension plans. Also, this amount does not include changes to our cares tax receivable in the quarter, which was a $500 million source of cash and is included in the income taxes bar of this chart. Working capital was effectively flat this quarter. During the quarter, MPLX reduced its third-party debt by $1 billion funded by borrowing an additional $877 million under the MPC or Marathon interCompany loan agreement. Our income tax balances represented a use of cash primarily driven by a decrease in accrued taxes. We made a tax payment due for the Speedway gain of $2.9 billion out of a total of $4.2 billion we have accrued. We were able to offset about $400 million of the amount using our cares tax receivable.  There were about $100 million of other charges in our tax balances. During the quarter, we adjusted our [Indiscernible] tax refund up to $2.3 billion from $2.1 billion last quarter. We have identified a total of about $700 million that can be offset against our Speedway tax obligation, including the 400 million we used this quarter, and 300 million that we expect to use in the fourth quarter of 2021 to offset remaining balances for taxes due from our Speedway transaction. We received $1.55 billion of the CARES Act refund in October. There is about $60 million of the refund remaining, which we expect to receive in the first half of 2022 with respect to capital return, MPC returned $370 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $928 million worth of shares in the quarter using Speedway's proceeds. At the end of the quarter, MPC had $13.2 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit.  Last quarter, we promised to continue to provide status updates on our progress deploying speedway proceeds. We have repurchased an incremental $1.5 billion in shares since the end of the second quarter. This is comprised of $928 million of repurchase in the third quarter plus additional shares purchased through the end of October. As Mike indicated, we are approximately 25% complete with our $10 billion share repurchase program. We are continuing to use a program that allows us to buy on an ongoing basis and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls. To meet our $10 billion share repurchase commitment, we are progressing steps to be able to complete the remaining repurchases of approximately $7.5 billion by the end of 2022. The options we have previously discussed remain available to us to complete this objective.  Today, we also announced that we intend to redeem an additional $2.1 billion of debt. This entails two tranches of notes that mature in 2023, given the current interest rate environment as well as our cash position. It makes economic sense to redeem these notes early, and we anticipate this will lead to roughly $20 million of savings. This short-term cash management provides immediate interest payment savings, and we'll have the ability to reissue notes at the appropriate time. With this redemption, we have no maturities over the next 3 years. Our third quarter debt-to-capital ratio for MPC, excluding MPLX, was approximately 24%. The redemption of these notes will continue to lower this ratio. As we manage our balance sheet, we continue to ensure that we maintain our investment-grade credit portfolio. Turning to guidance on Slide 12, we provide our Fourth Quarter outlook.  We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $200 million in the Fourth Quarter. The majority of the activity will be in the Mid-Con region. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.40 per barrel for the quarter. Based on the current prices we estimate that in the Fourth Quarter, higher natural gas prices have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel. As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back half-weighted this year. Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the Fourth Quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million reflecting the approximately $100 million in costs that have been removed on an annual basis. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian : Thanks, Maryann, as we open the call for your questions as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. I will now open the call for questions, operator.\nOperator: [Operation Instruction] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta : Good morning, team. Thanks for taking the question. The first question is around capital return. You still have $7.5 billion of stock, which is all stock to buyback by the end of '22. Based on what we know right now, is it fair to assume that you're going to be buying this back ratably at $1.5 billion a quarter or do you see yourself leaning into it and then tie that into your capital return strategy at MPLX, we saw the special dividend that came through this morning is that something that we should think of as potentially more likely to happen going forward or was that one-time in nature?\nMaryann Mannen : Sure. Thanks, Neil. Let me talk about the share buyback program and your question around rate ability. Just maybe as a quick reminder, we did not get into the market until the completion of our Second Quarter earnings call. So we really didn't have a full quarter, if you will, and hopefully you've seen what we've been. doing in the remaining weeks post our earnings call as I tried to share with you. We do believe that we have opportunity as we go forward, given the timing of our earnings to be a little more opportunistic. So I would not assume in any way that ratably is the only plan that we have. I think what you can see is if that were to be the case, we certainly would have full ability to complete our program, as we say, no later than the end of 2022, but that is certainly not the only available set of opportunities for us. I will turn the call -- I will turn the question over to Mike on MPLX.\nMike Hennigan : Good morning, Neil. I'll address your second point. So I want to give you a little bit of a long-winded answer but hopefully it will get to the meat of your question. So at MPLX, one of the things that we decided to do was to move the business model such that we would have free cash after distributions and after growth capital that would put us in a financial flexibility situation where we could have options. We achieved that about the Third Quarter of 2020 and as a result of that, we now have a situation where we have capital for deployment at MPLX that can be growth capital, buybacks, additional distribution for the base as you saw us bump that up today, additional distribution amounts in the form of a special which we've talked about a little bit here, and I'll address it further. But the bottom line there is we're going to be dynamic and evaluating what's the best opportunity for us on that side of the house based on market conditions, business needs, etc. etc. An important point though from the MPC side of it is, we often get asked the question, how does MPLX provide value to MPC shareholders? Well, we tried to enumerate many different ways, but this is one other example where this is additional cash that's coming from MPLX to MPC.  So at the base distribution amount, MPC gets about $1.8 billion. And that's been pretty ratable since 2020. With this special distribution amount, it will now be $2.2 billion because it's about 400 million MPC 's take of the special that went to all unit holders. So instead of a 1.8 say EBITDA addition from MPC, you're now looking at 2.2 and we'll continue to evaluate that going forward. It's clearly our intent to grow earnings at MPLX. And as a result of that, there's going to be more cash available to come to MPC overtime, whether it's through distributions to the base or special, while we also continue to look at buybacks at MPC as well. So hopefully everybody sees this as a nice strategic importance of MPLX to MPC shareholders as part of our overall scheme here. That makes sense to you Neil?\nNeil Mehta : No. That's really helpful, Mike. And my follow-up is kind of a housekeeping modeling type of stuff, which is 2 parts to it. One is, tax rate came in a little bit lower than expected this quarter, Should we think about tax rate going forward given that midstream, such a big part of the earnings, lower than the 24% effective tax rate that we've been base casing. And then just any waiver on ' 22 capex, 2 kind of housekeeping questions.\nMaryann Mannen : Neil on the tax question. So you're absolutely right in the quarter, frankly, we actually recorded from continuing operations about an $18 million benefit. Part of that is driven by our ability to carry back the incremental pension contribution and some other favorable discrete items in the quarter. The second part of your question is whether or not we would actually migrate towards the statutory rate of 24%. And I think you've articulated that as we look at the amount of non-controlling interest, we would most likely not see a statutory rate of 24% but as the level of R and M continues to improve against that, we'll see that rate get higher than the 2% that you were seeing on a year-to-date basis. So we will migrate from 2% trending toward, but we would not reach the statutory rate. We have continued to make this adjustment since the First Quarter of 2020, and we will do that in the fourth quarter for consistency.  But most likely going forward beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will not be making a tax adjustment to bring all of our earnings to 24%. I hope that -- I hope that answered the question. And then I'll address your second question around capital. As you saw, we had a significant reduction from 2020 to 2021 and we're largely on track to reach that capex number for 2021. We have not given guidance for 2022 as yet and we'll do that on our fourth quarter earnings call, as we normally do. But I think as you know, one of the key strategic pillars along with cost reduction is strict capital discipline. We've begun to outline for you the amount of capital that we are targeting or committing to renewables, and we would expect to be able to share that with you as well for when we give our guidance.\nNeil Mehta : Thanks, Maryann.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Guys you've given a lot of every part, a lot of detail about cost reductions, price of gasoline [Indiscernible] and so on. I wonder if I could ask you to [Indiscernible] it down for us a little bit. As we transition back to, for one of a better expression, mid-cycle, What do you see as the mid-cycle EBITDA for the portfolio after all the changes, what it stands like today and I'm talking specifically the refining business at the MLP consolidation. Is that something you can quantify?\nMike Hennigan : Doug it's Mike. As you know from some of our previous conversations, I think it's very, very hard to call the mid-cycle. I often say I used the football analogy that just getting it between the 40's is tough enough, let alone trying to find mid-cycles. So -- but most importantly for me, Doug, I will tell you that the way we manage the Company is we're not concerned about calling the 50 versus the 40. I'd like to think about the 2-end zones. How do we feel about a low environment and a high environment, and how are we set up from a portfolio standpoint, whether each of those come out is because invariably overtime, as you've seen, you'll see cyclical high margin environments and then obviously we've seen some pretty low ones with the pandemic. So I don't really have a number for you. That's not something we spend a lot of time with. Obviously internally, we also like to think about, where is our balance sheet and leverage, etc.  As Maryann talked about, right now we're in a different situation than normal. We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. We did a short-term optimization around that cash management. Ultimately, I think our leverage to a normal mid-cycle would be higher in the future. But we'll keep debating that and ultimately trying frame ourselves that we're in a good position. But at the end of the day, I don't have the crystal ball to tell you exactly what I think mid-cycle is going to be, but I do think that we're going to manage the Company such that we're prepared for either end of it and we're going to have the appropriate management disciplines and financial disciplines around those scenarios.\nMaryann Mannen : And, Doug. Maryann here, maybe at the risk of repeating that. But as we always say, we're going to control the things we can and whatever that mid-cycle brings, as I was sharing, we're $1.5 billion better than we otherwise would've been from the cost reductions that we've been able to achieve. We still believe we have some opportunities in our low cost culture but certainly we're 1.5 billion better than we otherwise would have been regardless of what that market brings us.\nDoug Leggate : Thank you. I was working in the office, I guess, but my follow-up -- I guess we've touched on this every other quarter, Mike, but the portfolio changes, Kenai is the latest than it seems to be these are kind of flat to be fair, or these are dribbling out over a long period of time. I'm just wondering if you could connect us maybe in a baseball analogy. Give us an idea of where you think we are in that process. And I wonder if I could also ask you to touch on whether there's any similar studies or evolution of the portfolio going on at the MPLX level. Obviously for a long time, there has been a lot of discussions over gathering and processing for that's the right fit for an NOP type of business and am hoping that.Thank you.\nMike Hennigan : Doug, to your first part, I don't know that we think about it as dribbling it around. I mean, from the portfolio standpoint, we've executed the sale of the Speedway business, which as everybody knows, took a long time to get through that process. We made early moves to idle some high-cost facilities in our refining system, converted Martinez to renewable diesel that's in progress, completed a feedstock JV, and an equity position in the feedstock situation for Dickinson. So we continue to examine the portfolio, I think we've done some things that shows the market that it is a high priority for us. It's one of my three main initiatives that I stated from the start with respect to [Indiscernible], I would tell you, Doug, normally, I'm not a big fan of announcing stuff until things are done or not, it's a general rule. But in this particular case, we've done an analysis. And the reason we disclosed it now is we're in pretty advanced discussions with several parties. And because of the timing of this call, we didn't want to have this call.  And if something progresses to closure in the near future, we didn't want everybody saying, \"Hey, why didn't you tell us about it? \" So we decided to go off our normal little bit and disclose that we may be able to execute something here in the short-term, but it may not happen as well. We're trying to be as open and transparent as we can be. We're evaluating it. It is advanced discussions and that's the main reason that we've decided to tell the market that's where we are. But I will tell you that we will continue to evaluate the portfolio. There's more work in our mind that needs to be done. And hopefully over time, people continue to see a pattern of us challenging ourselves to have a very robust portfolio that works in all market conditions. And ultimately, what I try and say to our team is we want all of our assets to provide free cash over the cycle of cash flows in margin environments that we hit.\nDoug Leggate : Mike, I wonder if I could just press you on the MPLX start up question. I guess drip feed was the better expression you should have used, but does that extend to MPLX?\nKristina Kazarian : Yeah. Could you just say that again? Apologies. We couldn't hear you. Did you say drip feed?\nDoug Leggate : I'm sorry. My point was I think drip feed was a better expression than dribble, I think was the Board [Indiscernible]. My question was those just extend to the MPLX portfolio.\nMike Hennigan : Yes it does. We've said for some time, and maybe to our detriment again, but we'd like to around transparency that we believe that there's parts of the portfolio very core and are going to continue to get capital deployment. There's parts of the portfolio that we do not think long term is core, but at the same time, we're generating free cash from those areas. And we'll continue to keep those part of the portfolio unless we see something that adds more value. The bid ask on the non-core has been wide and like I say, maybe no good deed goes unpunished. The fact that we've been open about that option, I think has lead people to try and low-ball us as far as some of the bids, but we know what the value of the assets are in our mind. We're not going to move them for numbers less than that.  We're happy with the execution of the assets at this point. So we're in what I call a good position. We're generating free cash. The portfolio is working for us. We'll look for an opportunity if it makes sense, at some point to divest something that we think can be more useful to somebody else in the long term. But if not, we will manage the capital into those areas and continue to generate free cash and deploy capital where we think there's more longer-term value. So long answer to your question, but yes, the portfolio is obviously something that matters at both MPC and MPLX.\nDoug Leggate : Okay. Thank you very much.\nMike Hennigan : You're welcome, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you.Next we will hear from Phil Gresh with JP Morgan your line is open.\nPhil Gresh : Yes. Hey, good morning. My first question is just around the balance sheet in the past, you've talked about. Parent leverage of I think 1 to 1.5 times. Obviously, you have a lot of cash coming in the door. The macro was looking more and more like mid-cycle faster. Does this impact in any way the way you're thinking about the right level of consolidator or parent leverage that you want to maintain moving forward?\nMaryann Mannen : It's Maryann. I'd say no, it does not. We are certainly as I tried to share, committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings on both MPC and MPLX. Our decision in the short term on the incremental debt is really based on the $20 million worth of interest rate savings. As I mentioned on the call, we're sitting at about 24% debt-to-cap that will lower that obviously as we take that incremental debt out. But it's short-term. We'll continue to look at the cash position. And then of course as we complete the share repurchase, we'll see that leverage move up a bit as well. But this in no way changes the way that we are thinking about the optimal capital structure for MPC and MPLX. We remain comfortable, if you will, we've been talking about 4 times at the MPLX. And as John mentioned on the call earlier this morning, we're sitting at about 3.7 at the end of this quarter.\nPhil Gresh : But just to clarify, Mike\nMike Hennigan : , I just want to add to what Maryann said because I want to make sure that the market doesn't over-interpret this short-term move. We have cash sitting on the balance sheet. The market has moved such that we can take out that a little earlier in such a way that we can put $20 million in our pocket. The interest rate that we're getting on the cash in the short-term, obviously is small basis points compared to put in $20 million in our pockets. So as an optimization, we look to take that debt out, but don't read into it, which I'm concerned that's what you are doing. Don't read into it that that's where we think our debt should be on a long-term basis. Does that make sense to you?\nPhil Gresh : It does. I just want to make sure Maryann did I clarify or qualify that correctly at 1 to 1.5 times for the parent leverage as well, or just sort of make sure I'm thinking about that the right way.\nMaryann Mannen : Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment, so yes.\nPhil Gresh : Okay. And then my second question. Again, with all the cash flow improvements here with the macro environment, does Marathon have a way that's thinking about its dividend framework, living forward post Speedway. I don't know if it's percent of cash flow, or something where you're trying to think about not only the buybacks which are reducing the dividend burden, but also the potential for dividend growth. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan : Yeah. Phil,It's Mike, so we're having a lot of internal discussions around the dividend level. But in the short term, our priority is to buy back the shares through the program we have. We're not going to make a change on the dividend while that program is in place, but we are looking at what's the appropriate level going forward especially considering how much cash that we're generating at both MPC and MPLX. And like I mentioned earlier, now the amount of EBITDA that's coming from MPLX into MPC for at least for this year is considerably higher than what it's been in the past. So it is something that's on our radar screen, but while we are reducing shares, we're going to concentrate on that program first before we make any further comments on the dividend.\nPhil Gresh : Okay. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan : You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.\nManav Gupta : Hey, Mike. given the cash build which we're seeing quarter-over-quarter, I know since you have taken over, you have been very focused on cost reductions, what you can control and optimizing the portfolio. But just because the cash is building, is there a possibility you could accelerate your renewal fuel development through more JVs or actually acquire some assets under development, or even other forms of renewable energy. I'm just trying to understand if that part of the portfolio can be accelerated here to inorganic means, is that something you could be open to?\nMike Hennigan : Yeah. We're certainly open to it. We have a team of people that's constantly looking at the opportunities that are out there inorganically. Obviously, we don't count on that in our base plan and we count on the things we control as you mentioned, but yeah, we have a whole team of people both on the MPC and the MPLX side looking for opportunities in renewables, and as well as all the other alternative energy options. In the short-term, we have not found anything that we think is worthy of deployment, but we'll continue to look at it. Some of these other technologies, I think, are going to develop over time, and I think we're going to get some opportunities into the future but up until this point, we haven't found anything that we thought was worthwhile. But we're certainly open to it. And like I said, we have a lot of people looking at all the different parts of this energy evolution that's going to continue to evolve over time.\nManav Gupta : And a quick follow-up here is during the quarter in refining, obviously the widening sour differentials were a meaningful tailwind for you. Obviously, what I think it's $150 million quarter-over-quarter, we are seeing opaque raise some volumes there, we're seeing some widening of the Canadian differentials. So if you could help us understand the outlook for medium and heavy sour differentials there and how that plays into MPC. Thank you.\nRick Hessling: Yes. Hi, Manav. It's Rick Hessling, I can help you there. So you're absolutely correct, here in the near term medium sours, heavy differentials have widened, so You're seeing that in the marketplace. Going forward, what I would share is there's a lot of puts and takes out there in the marketplace. We've certainly got the opec plus decision here, that's expected on Thursday that we'll pivot the market certainly a bit. We've got political intervention, ie, as SPR releases that always way in the outlook. So it makes it very tough to truly take a position above and beyond that you've got production. You've got Gulf or Mexico production, Canadian production recently, looking robust. but then on the flip side, you certainly have consumer demand. Where will that go? How will the demand play out? And then lastly, several other wildcards on how it will affect these differentials which is line 3 and Capline reversal here in a few months. So a lot of puts and takes Manav really hard to call going forward.\nManav Gupta : Thank you so much.\nRick Hessling: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nRoger Reed: Thank you. Good morning.\nMike Hennigan : Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Reed: Good morning, guys. Just dive into its here, First one on the Martinez conversion. Just to make sure you talked a little bit about feed stock earlier, how you're looking at where you are relative to secured feed stock and how that would compare to the normal process. In other words, if you don't have a 100% that's not a surprise because we're still what, 2 years away essentially from full run rates are year-and-a-half. And then are there any specific regulatory hurdles remaining permitting, etc that needs to go on there.\nMike Hennigan : Mr. Roger, I will let Ray talk about the regulatory side and then I'll come back on the feed stocks.\nRoger Reed: Good morning, Roger hey the big hurdle for us. The first hurdle was the environmental impact report was actually issued for public comment a few weeks ago on October 18th, and that's a 60-day comment period. I want to emphasize this. This is a major milestone for us and not an insignificant piece of work. It's a 450 page answered-the-questions and scenarios and so forth. There are initially was a little bit of miss interpretation. that, but I was very pleased to see that some of our key stakeholders, particularly CARB, came out in strong support for our projects. So that's encouraging. And we'll monitor any comments that we receive over the next 60 days and address those accordingly. At the end result, we are hopeful to get a land-use permit and that's the big deal because what that does is that allows us to go ahead and start construction. And what I want to emphasize is the project is ready for that phase 1. We're done with the engineering, we've got material stage and we're ready to put the building trades to work on getting phase 1 going. As far as our outlook on it, we remain where we've been in the past, where second half 2022 phase 1 of the renewable diesel project is online.\nMike Hennigan : And Roger it's Mike, I'll just add to with Ray saying first off on your question on feed stocks. So we continue to have commercial discussions around that. We have kept that kind of close to the vest for now and we'll keep it that way while we're having some of these discussions. But what I wanted to point out the is like Ray said. We're at an important point in the project. We're out for public comment like Ray said, we're ready to go to construction. I know the market has been asking us to disclose the capital. We're looking forward to doing that. We've been holding that back to get through this regulatory process. Once we're through that, then hopefully we'll be able to give you a lot more color with respect to capital and feed stocks and everything else as to where we are. But this important part of this process, as Ray just mentioned, will play itself out. And then hopefully by the next time we talk, we'll be able to give you more color.\nRoger Reed: I appreciate that. The other question I had, just to go the opposite direction of the discussion earlier on potentially coming up with a different solution for the Kenai Unit, lot of units are for sale out there from various operators on refining, and I was just curious, you did a big transaction shortly before you took this role, understandable, you'd want to clean up some of what you bought and some of what you already had but as you look out over the next 3 to 5 years, is there any interest in expanding the refining footprint or you look at the issues with cafe standards, EVs, etc, and you say generally speaking, we're probably shrinking refining from here? I'm just curious how you're looking at it strategically.\nMike Hennigan: Yeah, Roger it's Mike again, so I'd like to -- I never say never, but it's not a high priority for us to increase our refining position. I think the higher priority for us is to increase our opportunities in the energy evolution. You see us doing some things in renewables. We've gotten a few other ideas that we're percolating on that hopefully in time will advance the portfolio. But probably in general, as a general rule, we're looking to balance the portfolio and head a little bit more leaning in towards where things are going to be growing over the next couple of decades if we get the right opportunity.\nRoger Reed: Alright, great. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nPrashant Rao: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If I could follow-up on Martinez a bit, like you talked about where you are with feed stocks and obviously I appreciate keeping that close to the vest right now. But perhaps viewed another way, could you help us out with maybe thinking about the CI score or a range of CI scores or sort of bandwidth you're looking at that's feasible, or realistic for what's going to be produced out of Martinez. And maybe if I could tie that into some recent news, and some movement we've had here on sustainable aviation fuel, where it looks like, not only is the blenders tax credit higher, but it ties in an emissions reduction factor. Is that also sort of on the table that given where we are in, it will be coming on-stream. You'll have at [Indiscernible] BTC credit as well. So does that how does that change how you think about purposing the asset?\nMike Hennigan : Prashant, I'll start off and then I'll let Ray give you a little bit more color on SAF, etc. The first item is when we sanction this project, we assumed a 100% soybean so we assume the highest CI in theory, worse feed that we could imagine here, because over a long period of time, the market will [Indiscernible]. Obviously in the short-term, we are looking to provide some better opportunity on the feed stock side for Dickinson and for Martinez. But as I said, we're going to keep that discussion a little close to the vest right now while we get through this whole regulatory period, as far as SAF, we are open to the opportunity for us, but it comes with some puts and takes and I'll let Ray give you a little bit more color on that.\nRoger Reed : Sure, Mike. I just want to emphasize in the first portion of the Martinez's project, phases 1, 2, and 3, SAF isn't in the base scope for what we are engineering and building. However, having said that, we believe that SAF will be an opportunity for Martinez. And to support that, we're currently doing engineering work at Martinez as far as what the CapEx would be to add that to the portfolio. I think everybody knows that SAF economics will compete with renewable diesel. We believe that the economic drivers for SAF are not there right now, but they will be there eventually as regulatory and product demand. Support builds for this. And so that's why we're evaluating that Martinez. But I just want to emphasize in our, in our near-term, our next two-year focus at Martinez. We're not building for SAF, but that's definitely a future enhancement to the plant.\nPrashant Rao: Thanks. That's very helpful. And my second question, just to touch back and I think Mike and Maryann, you both talked about this in answering previous questions on this call, but I just wanted to take a different tack on those on the capital allocation, [Indiscernible] group potential for one, you are making great progress on the debt. The buyback is 25% through on the Speedway proceeds, now. I guess, and I know I've asked this before and others have to eventually can we expect that there should be a framework for return to shareholders out of organic cash flows. And in I'm just timing of when that might get announced. What do you need to see to be able to give us a bit, bit better definition on that. Do you need I mean, well is it something that you need to be maybe midway through the Speedway proceeds buyback and with a good view into 2022 right now or would you look to maybe get through the 10 billion first and then it becomes more of a 2023 or further out of question. I know it's -- a bit specifically, you can help us think about gauging our expectations on that. I think that'll be helpful. Thanks.\nMaryann Mannen : Sure. Thanks for the question. Maybe just a couple of things to just state here, you're right, 25% of that share repurchase as we shared of that $10 billion, we're on our way to complete no later than the end of 2022. And hopefully as you've heard, in terms of the debt reduction consistent with what we've been sharing with you, and certainly short-term in nature. I think what we've been discussing and what we've tried to share with you is we'd like to see more progress around our $10 billion share repurchase completed, before we begin to provide a little more structural content on how we think about the remaining use of that cash. We'd want to get a little bit further along in that $10 billion before we give you any more specifics around that, I'll pass it back to Mike and I think you want to add a little more color for you.\nMike Hennigan : And I think Maryann just said it very well. We're just trying not to get ahead of ourselves in the program. [Indiscernible] or we're looking at some opportunities that maybe are inorganic. We continue to look at that. We definitely have excess cash to the point that was opening in the call. As margins recover, we hope to be continuing to generate more cash through our business. So we're just trying not to get in front of ourselves. We know we have cash beyond the commitment we've made today, we know there's going to be opportunities and I understand your question, but we just don't want to get too ahead of ourselves because we're in a good spot, and we have some time here to continue to execute the program. And as we move along, we'll disclose more and more. Obviously, we want to grow earnings, so we're looking for opportunities.  I keep saying it's a return of and a return on capital business. We want to balance those were very committed to the return of as, as you've seen us, It's executing now, we'd like to see some more opportunities in return on as we continue to look for opportunities to grow earnings. So it's just that balance as we move forward and just not trying to get ahead of ourselves while we have the time to execute.\nPrashant Rao: Makes sense. Thank you both for the time.\nMike Hennigan : You're welcome.\nMaryann Mannen: Welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen : Hi there. First I want to follow up on the discussion about Kenai. Mike is your expectation that once the transaction happens that Kenai will remain as a petroleum refinery or is the operating environment so difficult out there leading to me your own decision to exit that it could be used for a different purpose once it changes hands.\nMike Hennigan : Yes. Theresa, I don't want to get ahead of the discussions that we're having, so I'm going to have to plan on that question.We're just -- like I said earlier, we're just in such advanced discussions with a couple of different interested parties that have different views of the marketplace that we just didn't feel that it was right to just ignore it on today's call in case something comes to closure. I will tell you that again, everybody knows this when you're doing deals even in advanced discussions, it may happen, it may not happen. We'll see how it plays out. And if it does, we'll have -- try to give you some insight to it and then we'll be able to talk a lot further about it if it does happen. If it doesn't happen, obviously we'll come out and say that as well. But it's just the timing of the call and where we are in the discussions that we felt it was worth given some disclosure.\nTheresa Chen : Got it. And going back to Rick's earlier comments about Line 3, and the cap line reversal current rate line-filling, I believe in fully coming on in a couple of months. So as part owner and who is operator at the system, the initially reversed capacity was pretty low, and I was just wondering if you have expectations that it will grow over time on the heels of the Line 3 replacement, bring 300,000 incremental barrels per day to Patoka. And what do you think it could run rate as in the repurchase differential from that?\nRick Hessling: Yes. Hi, Theresa. It's Rick again. So to your point, a lot of the answer truly depends on what grades are put on the line. Capline can move heavy or light and those and truly the volumes are going to vary significantly. From our perspective, we're excited about Capline. We obviously have Garyville sitting on the coast of the Eastern golf and it can be a recipient. But truly, volumes will be based on demand from us and others, econ. And then lastly, grayed, as I've already stated.\nTheresa Chen : Okay. Maybe if I could just clarify. So the initial reverse I believe with re-configuring 3 out of the 16 pumps. If you had to reconfigure more to laugh for more volumes, can that be done pretty quickly.\nRick Hessling: I would have to defer to MPLX on that Theresa.\nMike Hennigan : Theresa, it's Mike. Yeah, we have the ability to ramp up if the expansion is required, so I'll give you my take on top of Rick's. The whole genesis of the project is that Eastern Gulf is looking for more grades as Rick mentioned. Over time, my personal belief is there's going to be more interest there. The issue is supplying the pipe, whether it comes from the north, as you know, there was a project coming out of Cushing that doesn't look like it's going to go forward at this point, but whatever can get supply to that pipe I think is going to be advantageous to get more optionality down to the Gulf Coast. As Rick mentioned, our facility in Garyville is interested in some of the grades. The rest of the Eastern Gulf refining area would be interested in different types of opportunities as far as grade selection as well. So on the personal believer that over time, we're going to get the bottleneck and get more availability of crude into that system. And I do believe over time it is going to expand.\nTheresa Chen : Thank you.\nMike Hennigan : Your welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nConnor Lynagh: Thanks for squeezing me in, and I've got 2 questions, but I think they're relatively related, so I'll just ask them at once here. So 1 question that we've been trying to figure out is you guys obviously have significant savings that you flagged already from OpEx. But I think you've also flagged some operational improvements as well that might flow through more in terms of the capture rate or throughput margin, however, you want to define it. Do you have any framework for how people can think about it? I know you don't want to go to the mid-cycle framework, but just any thoughts on improvements that we should look for over the next year or two here. And the related question is, given that you have a lot of capital freeing up, here, are there any major upgrades or enhancements to your legacy refining business that you're considering over the next couple of years here?\nMaryann Mannen : Hey, Connor. It's Maryann, maybe I'll start here. I think what you're referring to is the commercial opportunities that we've been sharing as part of those 3 pillars, we've done a lot of great work as we've said, on cost reduction, strict capital discipline, hopefully you see that Kenai as another example of our asset optimization. I think when we continue to look forward, we still believe that there are opportunities for us to improve on the commercial opportunities, you mentioned capture being one of them. And as we've shared, we're a little bit, I'd say we keep that close to the vest for competitive reasons. What we intend to demonstrate to you as we go forward quarter-by-quarter is the actual realization of those efforts that have been ongoing by the commercial team. And you'll see those appear, and we obviously will call those out as they manifest through the earnings in the coming quarters.\nRoger Reed : Connor this is Ray. I'll briefly address your second question regarding refining spending probably the biggest thing that we have out there is a project that you've heard before, the Galveston Bay Star project. We still have some remaining spend on that that will go into '22 and '23 to complete that modification to the refining -- refineries, specifically, the remaining scope dealing with the reset hydro-cracker and one of the crude unit is the sour crude unit, but that's the biggest thing in refining on the go-forward plus at this point.\nConnor Lynagh: All right. Thanks for that. I'll turn it back.\nKristina Kazarian : Operator, are there any other questions in the queue?\nOperator: We are showing no further questions at this time.\nKristina Kazarian : Well, thank you, everyone for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning? Please reach out and our IR team will be available to take your calls. Thank you so much for joining us today.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Maryann Mannen",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our third quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.09 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.73. Adjusted earnings exclude $48 million of pre -tax charges primarily related to Hurricane Ida impairments and idling costs. Additionally, the adjustments include an incremental $272 million of tax expense which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate. Our year-to-date effective rate is just under 2%. We therefore expect to retain the tax benefits realized in 2021. We will continue to make this tax rate adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $500 million higher from the prior quarter. Cash from operations excluding working capital and a voluntary pension contribution was nearly $1.8 billion, which is an increase of $230 million from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we paid $575 million into our pension plan.  We elected to contribute this additional amount as it was beneficial from a tax perspective. This amount covers nearly 3 years of estimated contributions and we forecast the plan would be fully funded at year-end. This also increased the Cares Act benefit to a total of $2.3 billion. Similar to last quarter, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business and capital commitments, as well as covered our dividend and distribution. Finally, we returned nearly $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases. Slide 6 illustrates the progress we have made towards lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020, we have taken almost $1.5 billion out of the Company's total costs. Refining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion, midstream reduced by $300 million, and corporate costs by about a $100 million. Regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion.  We continue to emphasize our safe, reliable, and low cost focus across the organization. While we do not see further cost reductions of the same magnitude that we have already taken out, there are still opportunities for us to reduce cost. Natural gas prices were higher in the Third Quarter and continue into the Fourth Quarter. For every $1 change in natural gas prices, we anticipate there is an approximate $360 million impact to annual EBITDA to our R&M segment. Based on current prices, we estimate that in the Fourth Quarter higher natural gas prices have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel. As we have previously mentioned, our refining cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021. As we continue -- and we continue to believe these are structural reductions.  While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, everyday we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate. As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities and in no way jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from Second Quarter 2021 to Third Quarter 2021. A djusted EBITDA was approximately $500 million higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by refining and marketing, but also benefiting from our strength in midstream. $48 million of pretax charges during the quarter are reflected in the adjustment column. Moving to our segment results, slide 8 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment.  The business reported continuing improvement from last quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion. This was an increase of $444 million when compared to the second quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refined margins, especially in the Gulf Coast region, as that regions cracks improved 34% from the second quarter. As Mike mentioned, our Garyville refinery was impacted by Hurricane Ida. We estimate the cost impact was $19 million this quarter, with an additional $11 million to be incurred in the Fourth Quarter. We estimate the lost opportunity from the hurricane to be approximately $80 million. The Garyville refinery was down for about 10 days and took another 10 days to ramp back up to full production. The throughput impact was approximately 8.3 million barrels.  We also believe there was an additional $10 million of lost opportunity impact associated with the earthquake at our Los Angeles refinery which was back to the planned rate after roughly one week. Utilization was 93% for the quarter, flat with the second quarter. We saw lower utilization in the Gulf Coast compared to the second quarter due to hurricane impacts. The Mid-Con region continued its strong utilization and West Coast strengthened as reopening in California continue to increase demand. If adjusted to include capacity which was idled in 2020, utilization would have been approximately 88% in the third quarter of 2021. Operating expenses were higher in the third quarter, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. Slide 9 shows the change in our midstream EBITDA versus the Second Quarter of 2021.  Our midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. The strong cash flow profile and lower capital spending supported the decision to return more cash to unit holders. Today MPLX announced a 2.5% increase in the partnership's base quarterly distribution, and a special distribution amount of approximately $600 million. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter our midstream assets in the region were also impacted by Hurricane Ida. We estimate the cost impact was $4 million this quarter, with an additional $7 million to be incurred in the Fourth Quarter. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Operating cash flow was $1,765,000,000 in the quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, this excludes changes in working capital and an incremental payment of approximately $575 million into our pension plans. Also, this amount does not include changes to our cares tax receivable in the quarter, which was a $500 million source of cash and is included in the income taxes bar of this chart. Working capital was effectively flat this quarter. During the quarter, MPLX reduced its third-party debt by $1 billion funded by borrowing an additional $877 million under the MPC or Marathon interCompany loan agreement. Our income tax balances represented a use of cash primarily driven by a decrease in accrued taxes. We made a tax payment due for the Speedway gain of $2.9 billion out of a total of $4.2 billion we have accrued. We were able to offset about $400 million of the amount using our cares tax receivable.  There were about $100 million of other charges in our tax balances. During the quarter, we adjusted our [Indiscernible] tax refund up to $2.3 billion from $2.1 billion last quarter. We have identified a total of about $700 million that can be offset against our Speedway tax obligation, including the 400 million we used this quarter, and 300 million that we expect to use in the fourth quarter of 2021 to offset remaining balances for taxes due from our Speedway transaction. We received $1.55 billion of the CARES Act refund in October. There is about $60 million of the refund remaining, which we expect to receive in the first half of 2022 with respect to capital return, MPC returned $370 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $928 million worth of shares in the quarter using Speedway's proceeds. At the end of the quarter, MPC had $13.2 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit.  Last quarter, we promised to continue to provide status updates on our progress deploying speedway proceeds. We have repurchased an incremental $1.5 billion in shares since the end of the second quarter. This is comprised of $928 million of repurchase in the third quarter plus additional shares purchased through the end of October. As Mike indicated, we are approximately 25% complete with our $10 billion share repurchase program. We are continuing to use a program that allows us to buy on an ongoing basis and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls. To meet our $10 billion share repurchase commitment, we are progressing steps to be able to complete the remaining repurchases of approximately $7.5 billion by the end of 2022. The options we have previously discussed remain available to us to complete this objective.  Today, we also announced that we intend to redeem an additional $2.1 billion of debt. This entails two tranches of notes that mature in 2023, given the current interest rate environment as well as our cash position. It makes economic sense to redeem these notes early, and we anticipate this will lead to roughly $20 million of savings. This short-term cash management provides immediate interest payment savings, and we'll have the ability to reissue notes at the appropriate time. With this redemption, we have no maturities over the next 3 years. Our third quarter debt-to-capital ratio for MPC, excluding MPLX, was approximately 24%. The redemption of these notes will continue to lower this ratio. As we manage our balance sheet, we continue to ensure that we maintain our investment-grade credit portfolio. Turning to guidance on Slide 12, we provide our Fourth Quarter outlook.  We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $200 million in the Fourth Quarter. The majority of the activity will be in the Mid-Con region. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.40 per barrel for the quarter. Based on the current prices we estimate that in the Fourth Quarter, higher natural gas prices have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel. As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back half-weighted this year. Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the Fourth Quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million reflecting the approximately $100 million in costs that have been removed on an annual basis. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Sure. Thanks, Neil. Let me talk about the share buyback program and your question around rate ability. Just maybe as a quick reminder, we did not get into the market until the completion of our Second Quarter earnings call. So we really didn't have a full quarter, if you will, and hopefully you've seen what we've been. doing in the remaining weeks post our earnings call as I tried to share with you. We do believe that we have opportunity as we go forward, given the timing of our earnings to be a little more opportunistic. So I would not assume in any way that ratably is the only plan that we have. I think what you can see is if that were to be the case, we certainly would have full ability to complete our program, as we say, no later than the end of 2022, but that is certainly not the only available set of opportunities for us. I will turn the call -- I will turn the question over to Mike on MPLX. Neil on the tax question. So you're absolutely right in the quarter, frankly, we actually recorded from continuing operations about an $18 million benefit. Part of that is driven by our ability to carry back the incremental pension contribution and some other favorable discrete items in the quarter. The second part of your question is whether or not we would actually migrate towards the statutory rate of 24%. And I think you've articulated that as we look at the amount of non-controlling interest, we would most likely not see a statutory rate of 24% but as the level of R and M continues to improve against that, we'll see that rate get higher than the 2% that you were seeing on a year-to-date basis. So we will migrate from 2% trending toward, but we would not reach the statutory rate. We have continued to make this adjustment since the First Quarter of 2020, and we will do that in the fourth quarter for consistency.  But most likely going forward beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will not be making a tax adjustment to bring all of our earnings to 24%. I hope that -- I hope that answered the question. And then I'll address your second question around capital. As you saw, we had a significant reduction from 2020 to 2021 and we're largely on track to reach that capex number for 2021. We have not given guidance for 2022 as yet and we'll do that on our fourth quarter earnings call, as we normally do. But I think as you know, one of the key strategic pillars along with cost reduction is strict capital discipline. We've begun to outline for you the amount of capital that we are targeting or committing to renewables, and we would expect to be able to share that with you as well for when we give our guidance. And, Doug. Maryann here, maybe at the risk of repeating that. But as we always say, we're going to control the things we can and whatever that mid-cycle brings, as I was sharing, we're $1.5 billion better than we otherwise would've been from the cost reductions that we've been able to achieve. We still believe we have some opportunities in our low cost culture but certainly we're 1.5 billion better than we otherwise would have been regardless of what that market brings us. It's Maryann. I'd say no, it does not. We are certainly as I tried to share, committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings on both MPC and MPLX. Our decision in the short term on the incremental debt is really based on the $20 million worth of interest rate savings. As I mentioned on the call, we're sitting at about 24% debt-to-cap that will lower that obviously as we take that incremental debt out. But it's short-term. We'll continue to look at the cash position. And then of course as we complete the share repurchase, we'll see that leverage move up a bit as well. But this in no way changes the way that we are thinking about the optimal capital structure for MPC and MPLX. We remain comfortable, if you will, we've been talking about 4 times at the MPLX. And as John mentioned on the call earlier this morning, we're sitting at about 3.7 at the end of this quarter. Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment, so yes. Sure. Thanks for the question. Maybe just a couple of things to just state here, you're right, 25% of that share repurchase as we shared of that $10 billion, we're on our way to complete no later than the end of 2022. And hopefully as you've heard, in terms of the debt reduction consistent with what we've been sharing with you, and certainly short-term in nature. I think what we've been discussing and what we've tried to share with you is we'd like to see more progress around our $10 billion share repurchase completed, before we begin to provide a little more structural content on how we think about the remaining use of that cash. We'd want to get a little bit further along in that $10 billion before we give you any more specifics around that, I'll pass it back to Mike and I think you want to add a little more color for you. Welcome. Hey, Connor. It's Maryann, maybe I'll start here. I think what you're referring to is the commercial opportunities that we've been sharing as part of those 3 pillars, we've done a lot of great work as we've said, on cost reduction, strict capital discipline, hopefully you see that Kenai as another example of our asset optimization. I think when we continue to look forward, we still believe that there are opportunities for us to improve on the commercial opportunities, you mentioned capture being one of them. And as we've shared, we're a little bit, I'd say we keep that close to the vest for competitive reasons. What we intend to demonstrate to you as we go forward quarter-by-quarter is the actual realization of those efforts that have been ongoing by the commercial team. And you'll see those appear, and we obviously will call those out as they manifest through the earnings in the coming quarters."

            "content": "Thanks Kristina. Before we get into results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. Midway through the quarter, we were impacted by Hurricane Ida. The Ida hurricane passed over our Garyville refinery with wind speed topping 120 miles per hour. Fortunately, all of our employees in the region were safe but many of them experienced severe damage to their homes and the community around them. Our team was able to shut down our refinery in a controlled manner a day ahead of the storm and ensure operational integrity and safety of all of our employees. It took roughly a week to restore some power which enabled the first crude unit to restart over the next several days. The remainder of the refinery restarted sequentially over the next 10 days as more power became available to the facility. I'd like to recognize our refining team and our support groups for their dedication and efforts.  Our commercial teams also did an excellent job in keeping our customers in the region supplied through coordinated efforts across the Company. Maryann will cover this specific impacts when she reviews are refining results. In addition to the Louisiana Hurricane,our Los Angeles refinery with impacted by an earthquake on September 18th. Again, the major challenge was the loss of power. Once power was restored, the units were restarted, the refinery was back to normal operations in roughly 1 week. A gradual increase is in the demand for our products as mobility continue to recover. Globally, product inventories are at their tightest level in many years, and this improvement has lifted margins. In the U.S., gasoline and diesel inventories have steadily improved and are both at the low end of their 5-year averages. Jet fuel inventories have moved in at a 5-year range, although demand is still well below pre -pandemic levels, and we expect that to be a headwind for some time.  Our system is seeing gasoline demand currently 2% to 3% below 2019 levels with the West Coast still lagging at about 8% below. Diesel demand is now slightly above 2019 levels. Jet demand has improved, but still remains down nearly 15% to 20% below pre -pandemic levels. Natural gas costs steadily rose during the quarter, with an average increase of over $1 from the second to the third quarter. There's still some uncertainty as we head into the fourth quarter. But lower inventory levels and strong holiday travel could be supportive. And looking at next year of global products inventories remain tight and demand continues to recover, we would expect to refining sector to rebound in 2022. At the same time, we're watching prices to see if there is a consumer demand pull back. On the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we advanced several key initiatives. We progressed our renewables initiative with the addition of a new strategic partnership with ADM.  This JV will own and operate ADM's soybean processing complex in Spearwood, North Dakota. Upon completion which is expected in 2023, this facility will source and process local soybeans, supplying approximately 600 million pounds of soybean oil exclusively for MPC, enough feedstock for approximately 75 million gallons of renewable diesel per year. While this JV provides a locally advantaged feedstock for our Dickinson project, we continue to evaluate feedstock options for our Martinez facility in California. At Martinez, our renewable fuels facility conversion reached another project milestone when it's environmental impact report was issued for public comment in mid-October.  The process highlights our extensive effort working with the local regulators and other stakeholders. Also in October, United Airlines, Marathon and others conducted a successful test slate of a 737, which flew for 90 minutes using drop in sustainable aviation fuel. The SAF used during the test flight was 100% renewable drop in fuel made possible by proprietary technology from [Indiscernible] our wholly-owned subsidiary, which has a demonstration plant in Madison Wisconsin. And as we continue to focus on ways to strengthen the competitive position of our assets, today we announced that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for the Kenai refinery, which could include a potential sale.We often share our belief that our businesses both a return on and it return of capital business.  And this quarter we made progress strengthening our portfolio, continuing our low cost focus, and progressing our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. As of today, we've completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program. And we're confident in our ability to return the remaining $7.5 billion by the end of 2022. Finally, MPLX announced the Third Quarter distribution consisting of a 2.5% increase to its base distribution amount, and a special distribution amount as well. MPC will receive a total of $829 million. This announcement reinforces the strategic importance of MPLX as part of MPC 's portfolio, and its ability to return substantial cash to MPC and all unit holders. Slide 4 provides a framework around some of the ways we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. Our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social, and governments -- and governance or ESC dimensions of our operations.  It encompasses strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conserving natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies and embedding sustainability in decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders. We have 3 Company-wide targets many of our investors and stakeholders know well. First, a 30% reduction in our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030, second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025, and lastly, a 20% reduction in our freshwater withdrawal intensity by 2030. The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We have allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance two significant renewable fuels projects. In late 2020, we began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson North Dakota facility, the second largest of its kind in the U.S., and we're progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery through a renewable diesel facility. I'd also like to highlight a few specific updates from the quarter. We were recently awarded an ESG A rating by MSCI. We are the only U.S. based refiner that holds this rating. We continue to focus on enhancing our disclosures in this quarter, we also submitted data on our scope three emissions through CDP, and we're in the first in our refining sector to do so. We invite you to go to Sustainability section of our website and learn more about how we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review the Third Quarter results. Good morning, Neil. I'll address your second point. So I want to give you a little bit of a long-winded answer but hopefully it will get to the meat of your question. So at MPLX, one of the things that we decided to do was to move the business model such that we would have free cash after distributions and after growth capital that would put us in a financial flexibility situation where we could have options. We achieved that about the Third Quarter of 2020 and as a result of that, we now have a situation where we have capital for deployment at MPLX that can be growth capital, buybacks, additional distribution for the base as you saw us bump that up today, additional distribution amounts in the form of a special which we've talked about a little bit here, and I'll address it further. But the bottom line there is we're going to be dynamic and evaluating what's the best opportunity for us on that side of the house based on market conditions, business needs, etc. etc. An important point though from the MPC side of it is, we often get asked the question, how does MPLX provide value to MPC shareholders? Well, we tried to enumerate many different ways, but this is one other example where this is additional cash that's coming from MPLX to MPC.  So at the base distribution amount, MPC gets about $1.8 billion. And that's been pretty ratable since 2020. With this special distribution amount, it will now be $2.2 billion because it's about 400 million MPC 's take of the special that went to all unit holders. So instead of a 1.8 say EBITDA addition from MPC, you're now looking at 2.2 and we'll continue to evaluate that going forward. It's clearly our intent to grow earnings at MPLX. And as a result of that, there's going to be more cash available to come to MPC overtime, whether it's through distributions to the base or special, while we also continue to look at buybacks at MPC as well. So hopefully everybody sees this as a nice strategic importance of MPLX to MPC shareholders as part of our overall scheme here. That makes sense to you Neil? Doug it's Mike. As you know from some of our previous conversations, I think it's very, very hard to call the mid-cycle. I often say I used the football analogy that just getting it between the 40's is tough enough, let alone trying to find mid-cycles. So -- but most importantly for me, Doug, I will tell you that the way we manage the Company is we're not concerned about calling the 50 versus the 40. I'd like to think about the 2-end zones. How do we feel about a low environment and a high environment, and how are we set up from a portfolio standpoint, whether each of those come out is because invariably overtime, as you've seen, you'll see cyclical high margin environments and then obviously we've seen some pretty low ones with the pandemic. So I don't really have a number for you. That's not something we spend a lot of time with. Obviously internally, we also like to think about, where is our balance sheet and leverage, etc.  As Maryann talked about, right now we're in a different situation than normal. We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. We did a short-term optimization around that cash management. Ultimately, I think our leverage to a normal mid-cycle would be higher in the future. But we'll keep debating that and ultimately trying frame ourselves that we're in a good position. But at the end of the day, I don't have the crystal ball to tell you exactly what I think mid-cycle is going to be, but I do think that we're going to manage the Company such that we're prepared for either end of it and we're going to have the appropriate management disciplines and financial disciplines around those scenarios. Doug, to your first part, I don't know that we think about it as dribbling it around. I mean, from the portfolio standpoint, we've executed the sale of the Speedway business, which as everybody knows, took a long time to get through that process. We made early moves to idle some high-cost facilities in our refining system, converted Martinez to renewable diesel that's in progress, completed a feedstock JV, and an equity position in the feedstock situation for Dickinson. So we continue to examine the portfolio, I think we've done some things that shows the market that it is a high priority for us. It's one of my three main initiatives that I stated from the start with respect to [Indiscernible], I would tell you, Doug, normally, I'm not a big fan of announcing stuff until things are done or not, it's a general rule. But in this particular case, we've done an analysis. And the reason we disclosed it now is we're in pretty advanced discussions with several parties. And because of the timing of this call, we didn't want to have this call.  And if something progresses to closure in the near future, we didn't want everybody saying, \"Hey, why didn't you tell us about it? \" So we decided to go off our normal little bit and disclose that we may be able to execute something here in the short-term, but it may not happen as well. We're trying to be as open and transparent as we can be. We're evaluating it. It is advanced discussions and that's the main reason that we've decided to tell the market that's where we are. But I will tell you that we will continue to evaluate the portfolio. There's more work in our mind that needs to be done. And hopefully over time, people continue to see a pattern of us challenging ourselves to have a very robust portfolio that works in all market conditions. And ultimately, what I try and say to our team is we want all of our assets to provide free cash over the cycle of cash flows in margin environments that we hit. Yes it does. We've said for some time, and maybe to our detriment again, but we'd like to around transparency that we believe that there's parts of the portfolio very core and are going to continue to get capital deployment. There's parts of the portfolio that we do not think long term is core, but at the same time, we're generating free cash from those areas. And we'll continue to keep those part of the portfolio unless we see something that adds more value. The bid ask on the non-core has been wide and like I say, maybe no good deed goes unpunished. The fact that we've been open about that option, I think has lead people to try and low-ball us as far as some of the bids, but we know what the value of the assets are in our mind. We're not going to move them for numbers less than that.  We're happy with the execution of the assets at this point. So we're in what I call a good position. We're generating free cash. The portfolio is working for us. We'll look for an opportunity if it makes sense, at some point to divest something that we think can be more useful to somebody else in the long term. But if not, we will manage the capital into those areas and continue to generate free cash and deploy capital where we think there's more longer-term value. So long answer to your question, but yes, the portfolio is obviously something that matters at both MPC and MPLX. You're welcome, Doug. , I just want to add to what Maryann said because I want to make sure that the market doesn't over-interpret this short-term move. We have cash sitting on the balance sheet. The market has moved such that we can take out that a little earlier in such a way that we can put $20 million in our pocket. The interest rate that we're getting on the cash in the short-term, obviously is small basis points compared to put in $20 million in our pockets. So as an optimization, we look to take that debt out, but don't read into it, which I'm concerned that's what you are doing. Don't read into it that that's where we think our debt should be on a long-term basis. Does that make sense to you? Yeah. Phil,It's Mike, so we're having a lot of internal discussions around the dividend level. But in the short term, our priority is to buy back the shares through the program we have. We're not going to make a change on the dividend while that program is in place, but we are looking at what's the appropriate level going forward especially considering how much cash that we're generating at both MPC and MPLX. And like I mentioned earlier, now the amount of EBITDA that's coming from MPLX into MPC for at least for this year is considerably higher than what it's been in the past. So it is something that's on our radar screen, but while we are reducing shares, we're going to concentrate on that program first before we make any further comments on the dividend. You're welcome. Yeah. We're certainly open to it. We have a team of people that's constantly looking at the opportunities that are out there inorganically. Obviously, we don't count on that in our base plan and we count on the things we control as you mentioned, but yeah, we have a whole team of people both on the MPC and the MPLX side looking for opportunities in renewables, and as well as all the other alternative energy options. In the short-term, we have not found anything that we think is worthy of deployment, but we'll continue to look at it. Some of these other technologies, I think, are going to develop over time, and I think we're going to get some opportunities into the future but up until this point, we haven't found anything that we thought was worthwhile. But we're certainly open to it. And like I said, we have a lot of people looking at all the different parts of this energy evolution that's going to continue to evolve over time. Good morning, Roger. Mr. Roger, I will let Ray talk about the regulatory side and then I'll come back on the feed stocks. And Roger it's Mike, I'll just add to with Ray saying first off on your question on feed stocks. So we continue to have commercial discussions around that. We have kept that kind of close to the vest for now and we'll keep it that way while we're having some of these discussions. But what I wanted to point out the is like Ray said. We're at an important point in the project. We're out for public comment like Ray said, we're ready to go to construction. I know the market has been asking us to disclose the capital. We're looking forward to doing that. We've been holding that back to get through this regulatory process. Once we're through that, then hopefully we'll be able to give you a lot more color with respect to capital and feed stocks and everything else as to where we are. But this important part of this process, as Ray just mentioned, will play itself out. And then hopefully by the next time we talk, we'll be able to give you more color. Yeah, Roger it's Mike again, so I'd like to -- I never say never, but it's not a high priority for us to increase our refining position. I think the higher priority for us is to increase our opportunities in the energy evolution. You see us doing some things in renewables. We've gotten a few other ideas that we're percolating on that hopefully in time will advance the portfolio. But probably in general, as a general rule, we're looking to balance the portfolio and head a little bit more leaning in towards where things are going to be growing over the next couple of decades if we get the right opportunity. You're welcome. Prashant, I'll start off and then I'll let Ray give you a little bit more color on SAF, etc. The first item is when we sanction this project, we assumed a 100% soybean so we assume the highest CI in theory, worse feed that we could imagine here, because over a long period of time, the market will [Indiscernible]. Obviously in the short-term, we are looking to provide some better opportunity on the feed stock side for Dickinson and for Martinez. But as I said, we're going to keep that discussion a little close to the vest right now while we get through this whole regulatory period, as far as SAF, we are open to the opportunity for us, but it comes with some puts and takes and I'll let Ray give you a little bit more color on that. And I think Maryann just said it very well. We're just trying not to get ahead of ourselves in the program. [Indiscernible] or we're looking at some opportunities that maybe are inorganic. We continue to look at that. We definitely have excess cash to the point that was opening in the call. As margins recover, we hope to be continuing to generate more cash through our business. So we're just trying not to get in front of ourselves. We know we have cash beyond the commitment we've made today, we know there's going to be opportunities and I understand your question, but we just don't want to get too ahead of ourselves because we're in a good spot, and we have some time here to continue to execute the program. And as we move along, we'll disclose more and more. Obviously, we want to grow earnings, so we're looking for opportunities.  I keep saying it's a return of and a return on capital business. We want to balance those were very committed to the return of as, as you've seen us, It's executing now, we'd like to see some more opportunities in return on as we continue to look for opportunities to grow earnings. So it's just that balance as we move forward and just not trying to get ahead of ourselves while we have the time to execute. You're welcome. Yes. Theresa, I don't want to get ahead of the discussions that we're having, so I'm going to have to plan on that question.We're just -- like I said earlier, we're just in such advanced discussions with a couple of different interested parties that have different views of the marketplace that we just didn't feel that it was right to just ignore it on today's call in case something comes to closure. I will tell you that again, everybody knows this when you're doing deals even in advanced discussions, it may happen, it may not happen. We'll see how it plays out. And if it does, we'll have -- try to give you some insight to it and then we'll be able to talk a lot further about it if it does happen. If it doesn't happen, obviously we'll come out and say that as well. But it's just the timing of the call and where we are in the discussions that we felt it was worth given some disclosure. Theresa, it's Mike. Yeah, we have the ability to ramp up if the expansion is required, so I'll give you my take on top of Rick's. The whole genesis of the project is that Eastern Gulf is looking for more grades as Rick mentioned. Over time, my personal belief is there's going to be more interest there. The issue is supplying the pipe, whether it comes from the north, as you know, there was a project coming out of Cushing that doesn't look like it's going to go forward at this point, but whatever can get supply to that pipe I think is going to be advantageous to get more optionality down to the Gulf Coast. As Rick mentioned, our facility in Garyville is interested in some of the grades. The rest of the Eastern Gulf refining area would be interested in different types of opportunities as far as grade selection as well. So on the personal believer that over time, we're going to get the bottleneck and get more availability of crude into that system. And I do believe over time it is going to expand. Your welcome."

            "name": "Rick Hessling",
            "content": "Yes. Hi, Manav. It's Rick Hessling, I can help you there. So you're absolutely correct, here in the near term medium sours, heavy differentials have widened, so You're seeing that in the marketplace. Going forward, what I would share is there's a lot of puts and takes out there in the marketplace. We've certainly got the opec plus decision here, that's expected on Thursday that we'll pivot the market certainly a bit. We've got political intervention, ie, as SPR releases that always way in the outlook. So it makes it very tough to truly take a position above and beyond that you've got production. You've got Gulf or Mexico production, Canadian production recently, looking robust. but then on the flip side, you certainly have consumer demand. Where will that go? How will the demand play out? And then lastly, several other wildcards on how it will affect these differentials which is line 3 and Capline reversal here in a few months. So a lot of puts and takes Manav really hard to call going forward. You're welcome. Yes. Hi, Theresa. It's Rick again. So to your point, a lot of the answer truly depends on what grades are put on the line. Capline can move heavy or light and those and truly the volumes are going to vary significantly. From our perspective, we're excited about Capline. We obviously have Garyville sitting on the coast of the Eastern golf and it can be a recipient. But truly, volumes will be based on demand from us and others, econ. And then lastly, grayed, as I've already stated. I would have to defer to MPLX on that Theresa."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. During the second quarter, we saw gradual improvements in the demand for our products as the rollout of COVID vaccinations and removal of mobility restrictions have led to more economic activity and increased demand for transportation fuels. That said, we're close to the end of the summer driving season, which is typically our strongest part of the year. Gasoline demand is currently 2% to 5% below 2019 levels with the West Coast still lagging at about 10% down. Diesel demand continues to hold up well and is flat to 2019. Despite the growing levels of personal passenger traffic, we continue to see an absence of the longer haul international flights and business travel. Overall, jet demand remains down nearly 30% below pre-pandemic levels. The full return of aviation fuel demand will likely still take some time, particularly with the recent increasing spread of the COVID-19 variants. As we head into the second half of the year, we remain hopeful, but cautious in the recovery. And so we'll remain focused on the elements of our business within our control. Slide 4 highlights progress on our strategic priorities for the quarter. First on May 14, we closed the sale of our Speedway business to 7-Eleven. In conjunction with the close, we announced our plans to return $10 billion of sale proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases. As part of our commitment to quickly return capital, we immediately launched a modified Dutch auction tender offer in which we're able to repurchase nearly $1 billion worth of shares. As we shared in our release this morning, we are proceeding with the next steps in our plan to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital over the next 12 to 16 months. Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio. Dickinson reached full design capacity during the quarter at approximately 180 million gallons per year, Dickinson is the second largest renewable diesel facility in the United States. At Martinez, we're progressing detailed engineering and permitting to convert that oil refinery to a renewable diesel facility. Based on our progress and discussion with feedstock suppliers, we're confident in the timeline we have set to begin producing renewable diesel in the second half of 2022 with approximately 260 million gallons per year of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. Third, we continue to keep a diligent focus on cost and capital in a challenging commodity business such as ours, being a low-cost operator ensures we will remain competitive. We have continued to challenge ourselves to examine all aspects of spend, and as a result, have delivered incremental progress. In the first half of 2021, our operating results reflect our goal to reduce overall refining cost structure by $1 billion. Importantly, I want to note that in June we published our two annual ESG related reports. Our sustainability report provides an in-depth look at the company's sustainability approach and performance consistent with the reporting guidance from SASB and GRI. Our perspectives on climate related scenarios follows guidance from TCFD and analyzes the company's resiliency relative to climate scenarios put forth by the IEA. On Slide 5, I'd like to take a moment to go over some of the ways we're challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. From a strategic standpoint, our focus is to balance the needs of today while investing in a sustainable energy diverse future. That includes strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conservative natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies and embedding sustainability and decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders. We currently have three company-wide targets, many of our investors know well. First, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030. Second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025. And lastly, a 20% reduction in our fresh water withdrawal intensity by 2030. The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We've allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance two significant renewable fuels projects. In late 2020, we began renewable diesel production, our Dickinson North Dakota facility, second of its kind in the United States and are progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery tool, renewable diesel facility. Finally, to demonstrate our focus on making sustainability pervasive in all we do for executives and employees, we link a portion of the annual bonus program to an ESG metric. We recently introduced a diversity equity and inclusion component to these metrics as well, making us the first U.S. independent downstream company to link improving diversity to compensation in the same way we led the industry in linking GHG intensity reductions to our compensation last year. Safety in our operations is another key to sustainable operations. In 2020, our teams demonstrated strong safety and environmental performance, including a nearly 40% reduction in the most significant process safety events and a 40% reduction in designated environmental incidents over 2019. Our personal safety performance continues to be better than industry average for the U.S. refining and midstream sectors. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review second quarter results.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Slide six, provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion for the quarter. This includes the results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital, was $1.535 billion, which is approximately $1 billion increase from the prior quarter. And for the first time in nearly 18 months, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business, capital commitments, as well as covered our dividend and distributions. Finally, we returned nearly $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases. The close of the Speedway sale marked a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio. So we wanted to call out some of the key points on Slide 7. We received total proceeds for the sale of Speedway of $21 billion; based on our tax basis our cash taxes current and deferred will be approximately $4.2 billion, which is lower than our original $4.5 billion estimate. We have accrued for this on the balance sheet. In addition, we had closing adjustments of approximately $400 million. Therefore, the after-tax proceeds from the sale will be $17.2 billion. To be clear this number is higher than our initial $16.5 billion estimate. On Slide 8, we present an overview of the use of the proceeds. Since the close of the transaction we have reduced structural debt by $2.5 billion and purchased approximately $1 billion of stock. In the post tender period we did not repurchase any incremental shares in light of a couple of regulatory constraints; First, a post tender cooling off period, and second, our routine quarterly restricted period in the lead-up to the release of our earnings information. That said not repurchasing during that limited window is not indicative of any deviation from our commitment to complete within 12 to 16 months. Consistent with that commitment as Mike mentioned earlier, we are commencing the next steps to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital. Specifically, we are entering into an open market repurchase program that will allow us to buy for a period of time, including when the company may have information that otherwise precludes us from trading. And we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls. Slide 9, illustrates the progress we have made lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020, we have made a step change in our refining operating cost and decreased our overall cost profile by approximately $1 billion. While there is quarter-to-quarter variability, our refining operating cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021. We have applied the same cost discipline framework that we use for refining operating costs to our corporate cost as well. There may be variations in these corporate costs quarter-to-quarter we believe we have lowered our overall cost structure by more than $100 million. And we are committed to challenging ourselves every day on ways to reduce expenses. As you know, natural gas is a variable cost in operating a refinery, these costs have recently increased nearly $1 per MMBtu, and we anticipate this being a headwind for the third quarter. While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, every day we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate. As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities and in no way jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations. Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2021 to second quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was more than $600 million higher quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by refining and marketing. As we previously mentioned, this quarter's results include the impacts of closing the Speedway sale. Here you can see the $11.7 billion pretax gain on the sale reflected in the adjustments column of $11.6 billion, which includes other adjustments of $79 million for impairments and transaction related costs. The $3.7 billion financial tax provision, excuse me, financial tax provision reflects the net impact of cash taxes and deferred tax impact. The resulting $8 billion gain on sale is reflected in our quarterly net income. Slide 18 in our appendix walks through the specific impacts of the Speedway sale across the three financial statements. Moving to our segment slide results; Slide 11 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment. The business recorded the second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA since the start of the COVID pandemic with adjusted EBITDA of $751 million. This was an increase of $728 million when compared to the first quarter of 2021; the increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, especially in the Mid-Con region as that region's cracks improved 57% from the first quarter. Also contributing to the improved results was higher utilization, which was 94% for the second quarter versus 83% in the first quarter. It's important to recall that we idled two high cost refineries in 2020. If adjusted to include that capacity, idled in 2020 utilization would have been approximately 78% in the first quarter of 2021 and subsequently increased to 89% in the second quarter of 2021. Operating expenses were relatively flat with the previous quarter, despite the increase in utilization, reflecting the team's commitment to cost discipline despite rising variable cost. Slide 12 shows a change in our midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2021. Our midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Here again, the team continues to make excellent progress executing on the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, lowering the cost structure and portfolio optimization. By the end of 2021, we estimate that MPLX will have decreased their structural costs by $300 million. Slide 13, presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. It reflects both our continuing and just continued operations. We have also specifically called out items related to the Speedway close. Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.5 billion in the quarter. Changes in working capital were flat this quarter increasing crude prices provided a source of more than $500 million, which was mostly offset by the large receivable balance with Speedway becoming a third-party customer and typical seasonal refined product inventory builds. During the quarter, MPC decreased debt by $3.3 billion. Additionally, MPLX reduced third-party debt by approximately $800 million during the quarter. With respect to capital return MPC returned $380 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $981 million worth of shares using Speedway proceeds. At the end of the quarter, MPC had $17.3 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Turning to guidance on Slide 14, we provide our third quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $195 million in the third quarter. The majority of the activity will be at our Robinson and Mandan refineries in the Mid-Con region. As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back half weighted this year. Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. And so you are seeing the impact in our guided costumes for the third quarter. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.05 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million consistent with the second quarter and reflecting the approximately $100 billion \u2013 $100 million, excuse me, in costs that have been removed on an annual basis. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, if time permits we will be prompt for additional questions. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team, and nice results here this quarter. The first question I had was just about the execution of capital returns. As you said, you have $9 billion to return to capital \u2013 capital to return back to shareholders here over the next 12 to 16 months. Is it fair to say it's going to be in the form of a buyback? And will you be executing it just ratably in the market? Just talk a little bit about how you plan on executing it? And is there any consideration of anything other than a buyback for the capital returns?\nMaryann Mannen: Sure, Neil. Hi. it's Maryann and good morning. Yes, we are planning on commencing what we would call our open market repurchase program and that will begin here immediately after the call. We have all of those options that we've shared with you in the past, all of the tools, ASR and open-market purchase, including the possibility for a tender. Those still remain all viable options for us, but we believe right now that the best way for us to achieve that commitment and as we reiterated here on the call, in the next 12 to 16 months and to return that remaining $9 billion would be through an open-market purchase program right now.\nNeil Mehta: And Maryann, as you guys think about that repurchase, is the view that you would want to do it ratably? Or do you want to be opportunistic? Do you believe that the right approach to share repurchases is cost averaging in over the next 12 to 16 months or to be opportunistic on volatility? Just talk about your strategy around execution?\nMaryann Mannen: Sure, Neil. I think, look, the reason why we're using an open-market repurchase program is we believe we have some control over that and certainly using an opportunistic approach over this time period is the approach that we believe is best for us during this time period. So certainly, we would be using an opportunistic approach during this time period.\nNeil Mehta: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nDoug Leggate: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everybody. Mike, there is \u2013 I guess, there's murmurings that the Biden administration could take a hard look at partnership structures for MLPs. I'm just curious if you can offer any perspective on how it might change your thoughts around your ownership structure and the current strategy around MPLX, if something like that plays out?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Doug, it's a good question. So obviously, with the administration change and with the agenda that they have out there, they're looking for ways to pay for the programs that they have in place. So we're aware of the potential there. Obviously, there's a couple bills that are involved with that dynamic. I would tell you, right now, our thinking though, is that we would stay in the MLP structure because we don't think it's going to change. We don't know for sure. Obviously, if it did lose its tax status, it would change our dynamic. But right now, Doug, if you're asking what's the probability, I think we are on the side of \u2013 we don't think it is going to change, and we think the partnership will still maintain its tax status. So obviously, for the size of the MLP that we have, if all of a sudden, it was a taxed entity you're looking at around $800 million to $1 billion of cash flow that would be lost. And I know others have asked this in the past. I mean, it's predominantly the number one reason why we maintain the partnership structure as compared to converting to a C corp. There's two dynamics that come into play. One is an immediate tax impact to all unitholders, of which MPC is the largest, obviously. And then, more importantly is to the ongoing cash flow change that would occur at MPLX. So we understand some of the pros and cons of the structure. At the same time, we think having that cash flow keeps us in the MLP mode. So obviously, if the rules change, if the administration does something different, we'll adapt accordingly. But in the short term, we still support the structure because it gives us that additional cash flow as opposed to a tax burden.\nDoug Leggate: Yes, presumably, you're not aware of any discussions that you've had then with the administration around this particular issue.\nMike Hennigan: No, I mean, we know that there's some advocacies for it and some that are against it. Our intel is that we think at the end of the day, the partnership status will stay the way it is. But I'm not trying to call politics here, Doug. Whatever happens, we'll adjust to it, but for right now, we think the MLP structure will stay the way it is. \nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Mike, my follow-up is, I guess, as a follow-on to the question on buybacks just to kind of put some numbers to you that I'm sure you're very familiar with. Your market capitalization, obviously, mid-30s, you strip out your share of the publicly traded value of MPLX. And what you're left with there's a value of around $15 billion, $16 billion, which implies that the remaining buyback would be more than half of the current market capitalization. Clearly, that's impactful. I'm just wondering if you can frame for us how you would intend to tackle a buyback of that scale when you think about it that way? I know you've touched on that a little bit, but when you put microchip in context, is it big enough. Just curious how you think about moving that forward over the next 16 months.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Doug, I would say it's a good problem to have. We are committed \u2013 as Maryann said in her remarks, we are committed to returning capital. At the end of the day, we \u2013 for a long time, we were saying about $16.5 billion. I mean, now that we've closed and worked through some of the details, it's a little over $17 billion. We have prioritized the balance sheet. We've taken out some debt there. We've maintained some dry powder to see how things continue to play out, and we've committed to $10 billion. So throughout the time from the announcement to close, we reiterated to investors that we wanted to do it as quickly and efficiently as possible. To meet our commitment of quickly, we offered a Dutch tender. The market spoke and said $1 billion as opposed to what we had offered out as far as the total liquidity. Now we are, as Maryann said in the remarks, we're going to go more opportunistic and be in an open market environment. So some of the questions that we get from people is are we still committed to that? And as Maryann said, we want to reiterate, we are committed to that. Nothing has changed in our thought process there. It is going to take time. To your point, it is a large number. We are limited by the amount of trading volume we have and the liquidity that we have in our shares. So that is part of the constraint that we have, but we are committed to returning it. And we're going to go into this program, and obviously, each quarter, we'll update the market on the results.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, Mike, for taking my questions.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome, Doug. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: Yes, thank you. Good morning. Let me take a quick detour over to the renewable diesel side of the business. Obviously, you've got the North Dakota Dickinson facility up and running. I was curious is it running off soybean oil? If you could give us any incremental views on its contribution to the Mid-Continent profit that we saw improve this quarter? And then, on the start-up in Martinez, what do you expect the feedstocks to be there?\nMike Hennigan: So it's a good question, Roger. I'm going to let Ray give you some specific on Dickinson? Go ahead, Ray.\nRay Brooks: Good morning, Roger, this is Ray Brooks. Just want to talk a little bit about Dickinson and how it's running. As you alluded, Dickinson is up and running now. During the second quarter, we did reach our design capacity of 180 million gallons a year, good news, and we're happy about that. The other thing operationally is we did reach the yields of renewable diesel we were seeking to get in the mid-90s, and so we're happy about that. As far as feedstocks, the design for Dickinson was basically an 80:20 mix of soybean oil and distilled corn oil. And as you probably know, the soybean oil economics are challenged right now. What I'm really proud of the team is doing is we're seeking every day to optimize a few things. First, optimize the operation of the facility to get to the lowest carbon intensity from our operations, and then, we're also optimizing the feed slate within the \u2013 from the design basis and we're having some success in that regard. So that's really how Dickinson is running. And right now, it's \u2013 like I said, it's up running, and it's the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the United States.\nMike Hennigan: Roger, it's Mike again. I was just going to say to your second question on Martinez, we're not going to disclose at this point what we're thinking about as far as the feedstocks. That's still in discussion with many players. So I can't really comment on that other than what we said in our prepared remarks that the engineering is going well, the permitting is going well. We still feel really good about the project from a lot of aspects. So we'll give you more color on that as time goes by.\nRoger Read: Okay, great. And then, a follow-up question, maybe for you, Maryann, just because you made the comment about natural gas prices being up. Are there any other inflationary aspects we need to watch for in the R&M sector here? I know you've got your overall goal to cut costs and some progress there, but there's always an offset unfortunately. I was just curious what else may be pushing against you there, recognizing, of course, that natural gas can go down about as quickly as it goes up. \nMaryann Mannen: Yes, you're right. And certainly, as we see it right now, we're looking at it as a tailwind that is natural gas to the third quarter. I would say to your first question around any other specific inflationary aspects, there's nothing \u2013 obviously, we didn't point to anything. There's really nothing of significance that we see at this juncture that would have a negative impact on the third quarter.\nRoger Read: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: So Mike, first, congratulations. I know you took over during the pandemic, but one thing which you took over when you stressed was everything has to be free cash flow in the portfolio and refining was free cash flow positive. I think, you made about $500 million or $600 million in free cash, so congratulations on achieving that goal.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Manav. \nManav Gupta: My question here is on those lines. If I look at your current dividend obligation about $1.3 billion and then, I look at the cash that MPLX is giving you about $1.8 billion, and you look at the corporate and expenses of like $175 million a quarter, like essentially, where we are in the equation? Even if refining only contributes like $100 million to $200 million to overall free cash flow, you can meet your dividend obligation. And once you do execute this buyback there's like $320 million or so dividend obligation reduction. So what I'm trying to get to is, not that refining will not make a positive free cash flow but you actually do not need a positive refining free cash flow to meet the dividend obligation. Am I thinking about these parameters correctly?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Manav, you are in general. I think, one of the things that sometimes people miss is our relationship with MPLX as you're pointing out. So at the current distribution level at MPLX, we do get that $1.8 billion coming back into MPC. So I think you're right. It's one of the uniquenesses that's a positive of the structure that we have. Right today, MPLX is generating excess cash flow beyond capital and distribution as well. So financial flexibility is increasing at the partnership as well. So I think, we're in a pretty good position from that standpoint, and I think you're thinking about it right.\nManav Gupta: Okay. And the quick follow-up here is, I mean, you have done a \u2013 the team has done a very good job of lowering OpEx per barrel. It is about 25% down year over year. So besides the closure of the two assets, Gallup and Martinez, which are the other assets or part of the portfolio in the refining, whether it was Galveston Bay or wherever, where these material reductions have come in, which is allowing you to push the OpEx per barrel down? \nMike Hennigan: Yes, Manav, it's really occurred across the whole portfolio. Ray and the refining team have done a really nice job on that side. All the support functions on the corporate side have done as well. So it is part of my DNA to be very, very conscious about cost. The team knows that's going to be a high priority for us all the time. In fact, if anything, Maryann just mentioned, as refining runs have come back up kind of with the recovery, variable costs have come up, but we've been able to maintain a pretty consistent level of OpEx there. So that's been a good story for us. We do have, again, natural gas potentially going up. But overall, we're going to continue to challenge the portfolio, both on the refining side of the business, also in the midstream side of the business. For those who listened to the MPLX call, we had originally stated about $200 million of cost reductions at MPLX. We've now increased that to about $300 million, about another $100 million that we feel pretty comfortable that we can take out of that business as well. So it's going to continue to be an area of focus for us. That's never going to change. We'll look for opportunities for us to optimize our system where we can. And back to your original point, we did have a couple closures. They were our highest cost facilities, but we're going to continue to evaluate the portfolio. I've said a couple times to people that I want to get out of this pandemic environment to see what things look like afterwards, but we are still evaluating all assets of the portfolio. And to your point, and I'm glad you remember that is I am a driver that all of our assets need to generate free cash flow. That's a mantra that I believe in, and we're hoping that we have that in our portfolio at all times. \nManav Gupta: Thank you so much for taking my questions.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome, Manav.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Gresh: Yes, hi, good morning. First question, just one additional one on the buybacks. The proceeds, as you noted, were $700 million higher than expected. I think, you still have a $2 billion-plus tax refund coming here in the third quarter. So how should we think about the ability over time to potentially exceed the $10 billion buyback target? Or perhaps another way of asking the question is, are there other uses you would see for the cash besides returning capital to shareholders, given what you've said about the balance sheet in the past?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey, Phil, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. Yes, as you know, as we've been sharing with you the use of proceeds, we've really just been focused on the $10 billion capital return. As you state very clearly, we know we have roughly $2.1 billion coming back from the CARES Act. We continue to expect to receive the lion's share of that in and about the third quarter \u2013 late in the third quarter, frankly, is our expectation. So you're right, we will have the remaining proceeds, as well as the incremental $2 billion that we'll continue to evaluate and make good decision really around whether or not that would go in the form of capital return. But we've not really declared beyond that initial $10 billion right now as we continue to look at the balance sheet. I think, you know the \u2013 obviously, our intent also was to ensure that we maintained investment grade as you hopefully you've seen the three rating agencies did reconfirm that. So we do have investment grade again on \u2013 by all three of those agencies. We certainly will continue to focus on the balance sheet and be sure that that maintains a nimble, if you will. But again, that use of proceeds will continue to evaluate as we go forward.\nPhil Gresh: To clarify, there's no change to the absolute debt or cash balance targets you've set in the past?\nMaryann. Mannen: That\u2019s right. Right, now for MPC, we've got about $9 billion of long-term debt. As we shared with you initially, we took $2.5 billion off immediately, frankly, as you saw in the quarter; we actually did a bit more than that a little over 800. We really cleared in anything that was sitting on our revolver as well. We'll continue to evaluate that. But at this point, we as you know, we were trying to be efficient about that. So we've not moved anything beyond that initial $2.5 billion of debt reduction.\nPhil Gresh: Got it. Okay. A follow-up, just one more on the operating cost equation. With $5 a barrel of OpEx here in the third quarter and the fact that OpEx is lower 2021 over 2020 despite higher throughput and higher Nat gas. Where do you feel we are, I guess this is for Mike in the cost reduction journey here? Particularly as you benchmark to peers there are obviously regional differences to consider across portfolios, but how far along do you think we are when you look at what peers are doing?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. So how far along is, is always a tough question because like I said earlier it's a never ending game. So we're going to continue to challenge ourselves. We'll look for incremental improvements from here. Obviously we've gotten the lion's share of book. We originally targeted to get, but it's something that we're going to continue. It's going to be part of our DNA, that we're going to look at every opportunity, every chance we get to continue to push that down. I am a believer that in this business, we need to be a low cost operator. The team deserves a lot of credit to get after that. And we've made some meaningful change, but we're not done. I'll quote Ray from the last call, we're not in the first inning and we're not in the ninth inning. So the game is still being played and it'll continue to be played. And we'll just obviously challenge ourselves all the time to see where we can run ourselves at as lean of opportunity as we can without sacrificing safety; that's another really important mantra. We're not going to put anybody at jeopardy, but we're going to run as lean as we can. And I just, my guidance to you is keep watching our results and keep talking about it. And as we have additional disclosures to tell you what's happening, we'll bring those up quarter-to-quarter. Like I just mentioned earlier midstream has just moved from a sustainable $200 million down to $300 million down. So we feel good about that. We're now telling people that we were comfortable with that number. Still challenging it in the midstream space as well; so we're going to keep the eye on the ball as far as our costs, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to be as lean as we can be.\nPhil Gresh: Yes. Thanks for the thoughts.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome, Phil.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. I wanted to maybe first ask about the refining macro landscape given that demand has recovered completely on the diesel front and mostly on the gasoline front; and with the utilization that you achieved in the second quarter as well as the guidance for the third quarter, it seems to indicate a relatively optimistic outlook for the near-term. So would you agree with that? And just generally, what are your views on refining profitability in the second half? And related to your comments about jet demand being off 30% or so, still is that what's capping the utilization guidance from here?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Theresa, sorry, I'll let the other guys jump in. I guess the term we use was hopeful, but cautious. So we are hopeful that we are recovering and continue to do so. What we've seen obviously, over the last year has been a very tough environment that we're coming out of particularly in the U.S. The reason we're still cautious, however, is the Delta variant is spiking up in a lot of areas. Outside the U.S. is a much more difficult environment than inside the U.S. today. And then you pointed out a couple of things. Jet fuel is still lagging in our view, and that'll continue to lag for some time, but eventually it will come back. But for right now, it is still lagging, and the other one that we pointed out was the west coast is still lagging. So we're going to have to see Theresa, to be honest with you, we're going to have to see how the COVID, plays itself out into the second half of the year. And as we approach another winter season if, if there continues to be increased infection, obviously there's going to be some restraint on the demand as a result like we've seen before. Hopefully not, hopefully people are seeing this variant spread and vaccination rates will increase from where they are today. I think there was a good responses originally, but I think it needs to go to another level. So we're obviously hopeful that people will take caution and get vaccinated. But in general, I mean, we have the same outlook that I think you and others have is that's why we use the word hopeful that we're recovering; coming out of this, but cautious that we still have some road to plow. And anybody wants to add. Nobody wants to add.\nTheresa Chen: Fair enough. And my second question is related to the Martinez conversion and following up on something that came up in a midstream call about housing some of the assets within MPLX, just in light of the midstream entity throwing off good free cash flow with healthy balance sheet currently, and needing to insulate its own terminal value. When we think about some of the bigger ticket items that you have to spend on such as the pre-treatment unit, or even the conversion of from the processing units, would it \u2013 would you have the flexibility to decide between MPLX participating at cost or dropping down once fully cash flowing. Is there a preference at this point between the two? If that is the fast-forward and just on the ladder, if you drop things down once fully cash flowing thinking, I think this is, I believe, your previous strategy with cap line and keeping that upstairs until it is fully reversed. Because when you boil it all down for Martinez, I imagine this would really didn't leave like a pretty meaningfully different amount of capital that MPLX could contribute to fund the project?\nMike Hennigan: That was a long one there, Theresa. Let me see if I can break it apart. I think that the main message that you're asking is we do have a unique structure that enables us to look to create value for both MPC shareholders and NPLS unit holders. So there is no rule of thumb to what you stated earlier, it's case by case basis. There's a lot of specifics to go into it. The dynamics of each of the individual opportunities, but we do have that ability to sit down and figure out how we can create value on both sides. So, obviously it's our goal to create value at MPC and MPLX and having the flexibility between the two structures, enables that. But I do want to leave you with, there's not a rule of thumb. There's not a, hey, this is the way we do this. Every instance gets its own debate and discussion, and we decide what we think is the best to create the most value.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You're welcome.\nOperator: Next we will hear from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nKristina Kazarian: Hey Paul, are you there with us today? Are you on mute by any chance, Paul? All right. Operator, let's move to the next caller and then we can have Paul re-prompt if you're with us, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, then we will hear from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nSam Margolin: Good morning. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, Sam.\nSam Margolin: Question on Martinez and the initial start-up; I just wonder how you're thinking about its performance in the period before the pre-treatment unit starts-up and I'll contextualize it with something, when your peer said, which is that there's an expectation that feedstock might eventually price itself on CI score, similar to the way that within the refining complex commodities price on sort of their end market value. And so I was just wondering if you're thinking about that as a possible outcome, and whether that may make operations before the PTU starts up a little easier? Or whether the expectation is really that Martinez shouldn't enter kind of a run rate profitability until that PTU is going?\nRay Brooks: Hey, Sam, this is this is Ray, and I'll take your question. You're right. As we develop the Martinez project and it comes on and phases \u2013 the different phases will have a different feedstock mix. And so Phase I essentially as we come on with the initial hydroprocessing unit that is going to be without the pre-treatment system. I don't want to get, like Mike said; I don't want to get into too much of the feedstock slate. What I would like to emphasize though is, is we have a lot of optionality around how we receive feedstock between truck and rail and water and ability without having to pre-treatment system still to optimize that \u2013 optimize that mix? The other thing I'll talk about Martinez, whether it's Phase 1 or Phase 2, Phase 3 is we did our \u2013 when we looked at this project, we looked at it with different feedstock capabilities and the most conservative feedstock availability, and for Phase 1. And we still feel good about the project, even with a \u2013 if it was a very strong soybean oil-based slate, but like said we're going to work to optimize around all the logistics assets, the capabilities that Martinez offers us. \nMike Hennigan: Sam, its Mike. I'm just going to add to what Ray said. I mean, I know your question is depending on where the market goes? But the thing that makes us feel really good about Martinez is several factors. One, we think we have a really competitive CapEx and OpEx situation, and that was one of the major drivers when we looked at this. Second as Ray just mentioned, we have really, really strong logistics; pipeline, rail, water, truck, we have a lot of opportunity there to provide value. And then the ultimate logistics is we're in California, where we're sitting on the demand. So location also matters. So regardless of what happens in the marketplace and it will ebb and flow just like every other commodity market? The reason we're so bullish on our Martinez asset is those factors that are in place day in and day out. The OpEx that we're going to run, the CapEx that it takes to get there, the logistics that we have, the location that we have, all of those play to our favor regardless of how the commodity move day-to-day; I hope that makes sense.\nSam Margolin: Yes. Understood. And then just to follow-up on RINs and the RVO. MPC's advantaged because you satisfy your D6 obligation through blending, but there's some elements of that that are hard to follow in terms of realizations because marketing outcomes have different RINs effects embedded in them. So I was wondering if there's anything you can share about just sort of the net effect of blending on the gasoline side and how you navigate it. Just the volatile RINs environment and maybe what that means on sort of a go-forward basis? Thanks.\nBrian Partee: Yes, Sam, this is Brian Partee. I can take that question. So, first thing I would do is actually zoom out just a little bit and think about a blended sale is actually further down the value chain. So it's naturally going to be a higher margin sales and say a bulk sale that doesn't have a rant or a blend component to it. So we've stated publicly that we're in that 70% to 75% from blend perspective from an RBO. So we're just naturally further down the value chain. I think you hit on a couple of things, though. The volatility is important. So the RVO is a 12 months compliance window, and it's really how you execute your compliance strategy. And it's the volatility in \u2013 actually in the high RIN environment that we're in now provides opportunities for probably an outperform or an underperformed depending on the execution of your compliance program and we meet those obligations. So that is something that's probably not been as transparent to the marketplace as we are historically around in nickel, or so. On RIN that now in this environment, it does provide an opportunity. Its high risk high reward, but we feel confident with our ability to execute both from a blended perspective of what we blend, but also on the compliance program?\nSam Margolin: Thanks so much.\nBrian Partee: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Your line is open.\nJason Gabelman: Yes. Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I'll actually try to ask the question, Sam just asked a little differently, which is I've you seen the value proposition for blending biofuels change in this environment relative to where it was in 2018, 2019, or is the value benefits still there, meaning that it blending offsets the financial costs of having to go out and buying RINs because it's been suggested that the value proposition has changed a bit for various reasons.\nBrian Partee: Yes. Jason, this is Brian Partee, and yes, I can take that. I think the great debate is the pass-through of the rant and the RFS costs, and it's very difficult to empirically point to that as a pass through. So, again, I'll fall back on the execution side of things. And I think that's really where the performance live, but it's very difficult to pinpoint any difference between the data points that you referenced back in 2018 to today, till today, It really gets boiled down to the execution side of thing?\nJason Gabelman: Okay. and then just a quick account question. There was about an $82 million benefit from other income, other income, excuse me, and refining a marketing margin that appears like the first time it's been there. Can you just discuss what drove that?\nMaryann Mannen: I'm sorry, Jason, its Maryann. Could you repeat your question again? You're saying an $82 million benefit in the, in the quarter. I'm sorry, I'm not following you question.\nJason Gabelman: Yes. For the quarter, and the line item other income included in refining a marketing margin.\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. Jason, we'll take a look at that for you and we'll come back to you. How's that?\nJason Gabelman: Okay, All right. That's great. Thanks.\nMaryann Mannen: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. \nKristina Kazarian: All right, Sheila, if there are no other questions in the queue today, we wanted to thank everyone for joining us. If you do have any outstanding questions, please feel free to reach out to our team at any point in time, and we will be here to help. Thank you everyone for joining our call today and have a great day.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Good morning, Roger, this is Ray Brooks. Just want to talk a little bit about Dickinson and how it's running. As you alluded, Dickinson is up and running now. During the second quarter, we did reach our design capacity of 180 million gallons a year, good news, and we're happy about that. The other thing operationally is we did reach the yields of renewable diesel we were seeking to get in the mid-90s, and so we're happy about that. As far as feedstocks, the design for Dickinson was basically an 80:20 mix of soybean oil and distilled corn oil. And as you probably know, the soybean oil economics are challenged right now. What I'm really proud of the team is doing is we're seeking every day to optimize a few things. First, optimize the operation of the facility to get to the lowest carbon intensity from our operations, and then, we're also optimizing the feed slate within the \u2013 from the design basis and we're having some success in that regard. So that's really how Dickinson is running. And right now, it's \u2013 like I said, it's up running, and it's the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the United States. Hey, Sam, this is this is Ray, and I'll take your question. You're right.

As we shared with you initially, we took $2.5 billion off immediately, frankly, as you saw in the quarter; we actually did a bit more than that a little over 800. We really cleared in anything that was sitting on our revolver as well. We'll continue to evaluate that. But at this point, we as you know, we were trying to be efficient about that.

            "name": "Maryann Mannen",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide six, provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion for the quarter. This includes the results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital, was $1.535 billion, which is approximately $1 billion increase from the prior quarter. And for the first time in nearly 18 months, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business, capital commitments, as well as covered our dividend and distributions. Finally, we returned nearly $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases. The close of the Speedway sale marked a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio. So we wanted to call out some of the key points on Slide 7. We received total proceeds for the sale of Speedway of $21 billion; based on our tax basis our cash taxes current and deferred will be approximately $4.2 billion, which is lower than our original $4.5 billion estimate. We have accrued for this on the balance sheet. In addition, we had closing adjustments of approximately $400 million. Therefore, the after-tax proceeds from the sale will be $17.2 billion. To be clear this number is higher than our initial $16.5 billion estimate. On Slide 8, we present an overview of the use of the proceeds. Since the close of the transaction we have reduced structural debt by $2.5 billion and purchased approximately $1 billion of stock. In the post tender period we did not repurchase any incremental shares in light of a couple of regulatory constraints; First, a post tender cooling off period, and second, our routine quarterly restricted period in the lead-up to the release of our earnings information. That said not repurchasing during that limited window is not indicative of any deviation from our commitment to complete within 12 to 16 months. Consistent with that commitment as Mike mentioned earlier, we are commencing the next steps to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital. Specifically, we are entering into an open market repurchase program that will allow us to buy for a period of time, including when the company may have information that otherwise precludes us from trading. And we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls. Slide 9, illustrates the progress we have made lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020, we have made a step change in our refining operating cost and decreased our overall cost profile by approximately $1 billion. While there is quarter-to-quarter variability, our refining operating cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021. We have applied the same cost discipline framework that we use for refining operating costs to our corporate cost as well. There may be variations in these corporate costs quarter-to-quarter we believe we have lowered our overall cost structure by more than $100 million. And we are committed to challenging ourselves every day on ways to reduce expenses. As you know, natural gas is a variable cost in operating a refinery, these costs have recently increased nearly $1 per MMBtu, and we anticipate this being a headwind for the third quarter. While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, every day we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate. As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities and in no way jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations. Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2021 to second quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was more than $600 million higher quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by refining and marketing. As we previously mentioned, this quarter's results include the impacts of closing the Speedway sale. Here you can see the $11.7 billion pretax gain on the sale reflected in the adjustments column of $11.6 billion, which includes other adjustments of $79 million for impairments and transaction related costs. The $3.7 billion financial tax provision, excuse me, financial tax provision reflects the net impact of cash taxes and deferred tax impact. The resulting $8 billion gain on sale is reflected in our quarterly net income. Slide 18 in our appendix walks through the specific impacts of the Speedway sale across the three financial statements. Moving to our segment slide results; Slide 11 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment. The business recorded the second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA since the start of the COVID pandemic with adjusted EBITDA of $751 million. This was an increase of $728 million when compared to the first quarter of 2021; the increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, especially in the Mid-Con region as that region's cracks improved 57% from the first quarter. Also contributing to the improved results was higher utilization, which was 94% for the second quarter versus 83% in the first quarter. It's important to recall that we idled two high cost refineries in 2020. If adjusted to include that capacity, idled in 2020 utilization would have been approximately 78% in the first quarter of 2021 and subsequently increased to 89% in the second quarter of 2021. Operating expenses were relatively flat with the previous quarter, despite the increase in utilization, reflecting the team's commitment to cost discipline despite rising variable cost. Slide 12 shows a change in our midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2021. Our midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Here again, the team continues to make excellent progress executing on the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, lowering the cost structure and portfolio optimization. By the end of 2021, we estimate that MPLX will have decreased their structural costs by $300 million. Slide 13, presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. It reflects both our continuing and just continued operations. We have also specifically called out items related to the Speedway close. Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.5 billion in the quarter. Changes in working capital were flat this quarter increasing crude prices provided a source of more than $500 million, which was mostly offset by the large receivable balance with Speedway becoming a third-party customer and typical seasonal refined product inventory builds. During the quarter, MPC decreased debt by $3.3 billion. Additionally, MPLX reduced third-party debt by approximately $800 million during the quarter. With respect to capital return MPC returned $380 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $981 million worth of shares using Speedway proceeds. At the end of the quarter, MPC had $17.3 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Turning to guidance on Slide 14, we provide our third quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $195 million in the third quarter. The majority of the activity will be at our Robinson and Mandan refineries in the Mid-Con region. As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back half weighted this year. Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. And so you are seeing the impact in our guided costumes for the third quarter. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.05 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million consistent with the second quarter and reflecting the approximately $100 billion \u2013 $100 million, excuse me, in costs that have been removed on an annual basis. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Sure, Neil. Hi. it's Maryann and good morning. Yes, we are planning on commencing what we would call our open market repurchase program and that will begin here immediately after the call. We have all of those options that we've shared with you in the past, all of the tools, ASR and open-market purchase, including the possibility for a tender. Those still remain all viable options for us, but we believe right now that the best way for us to achieve that commitment and as we reiterated here on the call, in the next 12 to 16 months and to return that remaining $9 billion would be through an open-market purchase program right now. Sure, Neil. I think, look, the reason why we're using an open-market repurchase program is we believe we have some control over that and certainly using an opportunistic approach over this time period is the approach that we believe is best for us during this time period. So certainly, we would be using an opportunistic approach during this time period. Yes, you're right. And certainly, as we see it right now, we're looking at it as a tailwind that is natural gas to the third quarter. I would say to your first question around any other specific inflationary aspects, there's nothing \u2013 obviously, we didn't point to anything. There's really nothing of significance that we see at this juncture that would have a negative impact on the third quarter. Hey, Phil, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. Yes, as you know, as we've been sharing with you the use of proceeds, we've really just been focused on the $10 billion capital return. As you state very clearly, we know we have roughly $2.1 billion coming back from the CARES Act. We continue to expect to receive the lion's share of that in and about the third quarter \u2013 late in the third quarter, frankly, is our expectation. So you're right, we will have the remaining proceeds, as well as the incremental $2 billion that we'll continue to evaluate and make good decision really around whether or not that would go in the form of capital return. But we've not really declared beyond that initial $10 billion right now as we continue to look at the balance sheet. I think, you know the \u2013 obviously, our intent also was to ensure that we maintained investment grade as you hopefully you've seen the three rating agencies did reconfirm that. So we do have investment grade again on \u2013 by all three of those agencies. We certainly will continue to focus on the balance sheet and be sure that that maintains a nimble, if you will. But again, that use of proceeds will continue to evaluate as we go forward. I'm sorry, Jason, its Maryann. Could you repeat your question again? You're saying an $82 million benefit in the, in the quarter. I'm sorry, I'm not following you question. Yes. Jason, we'll take a look at that for you and we'll come back to you. How's that? Yes."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. During the second quarter, we saw gradual improvements in the demand for our products as the rollout of COVID vaccinations and removal of mobility restrictions have led to more economic activity and increased demand for transportation fuels. That said, we're close to the end of the summer driving season, which is typically our strongest part of the year. Gasoline demand is currently 2% to 5% below 2019 levels with the West Coast still lagging at about 10% down. Diesel demand continues to hold up well and is flat to 2019. Despite the growing levels of personal passenger traffic, we continue to see an absence of the longer haul international flights and business travel. Overall, jet demand remains down nearly 30% below pre-pandemic levels. The full return of aviation fuel demand will likely still take some time, particularly with the recent increasing spread of the COVID-19 variants. As we head into the second half of the year, we remain hopeful, but cautious in the recovery. And so we'll remain focused on the elements of our business within our control. Slide 4 highlights progress on our strategic priorities for the quarter. First on May 14, we closed the sale of our Speedway business to 7-Eleven. In conjunction with the close, we announced our plans to return $10 billion of sale proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases. As part of our commitment to quickly return capital, we immediately launched a modified Dutch auction tender offer in which we're able to repurchase nearly $1 billion worth of shares. As we shared in our release this morning, we are proceeding with the next steps in our plan to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital over the next 12 to 16 months. Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio. Dickinson reached full design capacity during the quarter at approximately 180 million gallons per year, Dickinson is the second largest renewable diesel facility in the United States. At Martinez, we're progressing detailed engineering and permitting to convert that oil refinery to a renewable diesel facility. Based on our progress and discussion with feedstock suppliers, we're confident in the timeline we have set to begin producing renewable diesel in the second half of 2022 with approximately 260 million gallons per year of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. Third, we continue to keep a diligent focus on cost and capital in a challenging commodity business such as ours, being a low-cost operator ensures we will remain competitive. We have continued to challenge ourselves to examine all aspects of spend, and as a result, have delivered incremental progress. In the first half of 2021, our operating results reflect our goal to reduce overall refining cost structure by $1 billion. Importantly, I want to note that in June we published our two annual ESG related reports. Our sustainability report provides an in-depth look at the company's sustainability approach and performance consistent with the reporting guidance from SASB and GRI. Our perspectives on climate related scenarios follows guidance from TCFD and analyzes the company's resiliency relative to climate scenarios put forth by the IEA. On Slide 5, I'd like to take a moment to go over some of the ways we're challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. From a strategic standpoint, our focus is to balance the needs of today while investing in a sustainable energy diverse future. That includes strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conservative natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies and embedding sustainability and decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders. We currently have three company-wide targets, many of our investors know well. First, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030. Second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025. And lastly, a 20% reduction in our fresh water withdrawal intensity by 2030. The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We've allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance two significant renewable fuels projects. In late 2020, we began renewable diesel production, our Dickinson North Dakota facility, second of its kind in the United States and are progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery tool, renewable diesel facility. Finally, to demonstrate our focus on making sustainability pervasive in all we do for executives and employees, we link a portion of the annual bonus program to an ESG metric. We recently introduced a diversity equity and inclusion component to these metrics as well, making us the first U.S. independent downstream company to link improving diversity to compensation in the same way we led the industry in linking GHG intensity reductions to our compensation last year. Safety in our operations is another key to sustainable operations. In 2020, our teams demonstrated strong safety and environmental performance, including a nearly 40% reduction in the most significant process safety events and a 40% reduction in designated environmental incidents over 2019. Our personal safety performance continues to be better than industry average for the U.S. refining and midstream sectors. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review second quarter results. Yes, Doug, it's a good question. So obviously, with the administration change and with the agenda that they have out there, they're looking for ways to pay for the programs that they have in place. So we're aware of the potential there. Obviously, there's a couple bills that are involved with that dynamic. I would tell you, right now, our thinking though, is that we would stay in the MLP structure because we don't think it's going to change. We don't know for sure. Obviously, if it did lose its tax status, it would change our dynamic. But right now, Doug, if you're asking what's the probability, I think we are on the side of \u2013 we don't think it is going to change, and we think the partnership will still maintain its tax status. So obviously, for the size of the MLP that we have, if all of a sudden, it was a taxed entity you're looking at around $800 million to $1 billion of cash flow that would be lost. And I know others have asked this in the past. I mean, it's predominantly the number one reason why we maintain the partnership structure as compared to converting to a C corp. There's two dynamics that come into play. One is an immediate tax impact to all unitholders, of which MPC is the largest, obviously. And then, more importantly is to the ongoing cash flow change that would occur at MPLX. So we understand some of the pros and cons of the structure. At the same time, we think having that cash flow keeps us in the MLP mode. So obviously, if the rules change, if the administration does something different, we'll adapt accordingly. But in the short term, we still support the structure because it gives us that additional cash flow as opposed to a tax burden. No, I mean, we know that there's some advocacies for it and some that are against it. Our intel is that we think at the end of the day, the partnership status will stay the way it is. But I'm not trying to call politics here, Doug. Whatever happens, we'll adjust to it, but for right now, we think the MLP structure will stay the way it is. Yes, Doug, I would say it's a good problem to have. We are committed \u2013 as Maryann said in her remarks, we are committed to returning capital. At the end of the day, we \u2013 for a long time, we were saying about $16.5 billion. I mean, now that we've closed and worked through some of the details, it's a little over $17 billion. We have prioritized the balance sheet. We've taken out some debt there. We've maintained some dry powder to see how things continue to play out, and we've committed to $10 billion. So throughout the time from the announcement to close, we reiterated to investors that we wanted to do it as quickly and efficiently as possible. To meet our commitment of quickly, we offered a Dutch tender. The market spoke and said $1 billion as opposed to what we had offered out as far as the total liquidity. Now we are, as Maryann said in the remarks, we're going to go more opportunistic and be in an open market environment. So some of the questions that we get from people is are we still committed to that? And as Maryann said, we want to reiterate, we are committed to that. Nothing has changed in our thought process there. It is going to take time. To your point, it is a large number. We are limited by the amount of trading volume we have and the liquidity that we have in our shares. So that is part of the constraint that we have, but we are committed to returning it. And we're going to go into this program, and obviously, each quarter, we'll update the market on the results. You're welcome, Doug. Thank you. So it's a good question, Roger. I'm going to let Ray give you some specific on Dickinson? Go ahead, Ray. Roger, it's Mike again. I was just going to say to your second question on Martinez, we're not going to disclose at this point what we're thinking about as far as the feedstocks. That's still in discussion with many players. So I can't really comment on that other than what we said in our prepared remarks that the engineering is going well, the permitting is going well. We still feel really good about the project from a lot of aspects. So we'll give you more color on that as time goes by. Thanks, Manav. Yes, Manav, you are in general. I think, one of the things that sometimes people miss is our relationship with MPLX as you're pointing out. So at the current distribution level at MPLX, we do get that $1.8 billion coming back into MPC. So I think you're right. It's one of the uniquenesses that's a positive of the structure that we have. Right today, MPLX is generating excess cash flow beyond capital and distribution as well. So financial flexibility is increasing at the partnership as well. So I think, we're in a pretty good position from that standpoint, and I think you're thinking about it right. Yes, Manav, it's really occurred across the whole portfolio. Ray and the refining team have done a really nice job on that side. All the support functions on the corporate side have done as well. So it is part of my DNA to be very, very conscious about cost. The team knows that's going to be a high priority for us all the time. In fact, if anything, Maryann just mentioned, as refining runs have come back up kind of with the recovery, variable costs have come up, but we've been able to maintain a pretty consistent level of OpEx there. So that's been a good story for us. We do have, again, natural gas potentially going up. But overall, we're going to continue to challenge the portfolio, both on the refining side of the business, also in the midstream side of the business. For those who listened to the MPLX call, we had originally stated about $200 million of cost reductions at MPLX. We've now increased that to about $300 million, about another $100 million that we feel pretty comfortable that we can take out of that business as well. So it's going to continue to be an area of focus for us. That's never going to change. We'll look for opportunities for us to optimize our system where we can. And back to your original point, we did have a couple closures. They were our highest cost facilities, but we're going to continue to evaluate the portfolio. I've said a couple times to people that I want to get out of this pandemic environment to see what things look like afterwards, but we are still evaluating all assets of the portfolio. And to your point, and I'm glad you remember that is I am a driver that all of our assets need to generate free cash flow. That's a mantra that I believe in, and we're hoping that we have that in our portfolio at all times. You're welcome, Manav. Yes. So how far along is, is always a tough question because like I said earlier it's a never ending game. So we're going to continue to challenge ourselves. We'll look for incremental improvements from here. Obviously we've gotten the lion's share of book. We originally targeted to get, but it's something that we're going to continue. It's going to be part of our DNA, that we're going to look at every opportunity, every chance we get to continue to push that down. I am a believer that in this business, we need to be a low cost operator. The team deserves a lot of credit to get after that. And we've made some meaningful change, but we're not done. I'll quote Ray from the last call, we're not in the first inning and we're not in the ninth inning. So the game is still being played and it'll continue to be played. And we'll just obviously challenge ourselves all the time to see where we can run ourselves at as lean of opportunity as we can without sacrificing safety; that's another really important mantra. We're not going to put anybody at jeopardy, but we're going to run as lean as we can. And I just, my guidance to you is keep watching our results and keep talking about it. And as we have additional disclosures to tell you what's happening, we'll bring those up quarter-to-quarter. Like I just mentioned earlier midstream has just moved from a sustainable $200 million down to $300 million down. So we feel good about that. We're now telling people that we were comfortable with that number. Still challenging it in the midstream space as well; so we're going to keep the eye on the ball as far as our costs, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to be as lean as we can be. You're welcome, Phil. Yes. Theresa, sorry, I'll let the other guys jump in. I guess the term we use was hopeful, but cautious. So we are hopeful that we are recovering and continue to do so. What we've seen obviously, over the last year has been a very tough environment that we're coming out of particularly in the U.S. The reason we're still cautious, however, is the Delta variant is spiking up in a lot of areas. Outside the U.S. is a much more difficult environment than inside the U.S. today. And then you pointed out a couple of things. Jet fuel is still lagging in our view, and that'll continue to lag for some time, but eventually it will come back. But for right now, it is still lagging, and the other one that we pointed out was the west coast is still lagging. So we're going to have to see Theresa, to be honest with you, we're going to have to see how the COVID, plays itself out into the second half of the year. And as we approach another winter season if, if there continues to be increased infection, obviously there's going to be some restraint on the demand as a result like we've seen before. Hopefully not, hopefully people are seeing this variant spread and vaccination rates will increase from where they are today. I think there was a good responses originally, but I think it needs to go to another level. So we're obviously hopeful that people will take caution and get vaccinated. But in general, I mean, we have the same outlook that I think you and others have is that's why we use the word hopeful that we're recovering; coming out of this, but cautious that we still have some road to plow. And anybody wants to add. Nobody wants to add. That was a long one there, Theresa. Let me see if I can break it apart. I think that the main message that you're asking is we do have a unique structure that enables us to look to create value for both MPC shareholders and NPLS unit holders. So there is no rule of thumb to what you stated earlier, it's case by case basis. There's a lot of specifics to go into it. The dynamics of each of the individual opportunities, but we do have that ability to sit down and figure out how we can create value on both sides. So, obviously it's our goal to create value at MPC and MPLX and having the flexibility between the two structures, enables that. But I do want to leave you with, there's not a rule of thumb. There's not a, hey, this is the way we do this. Every instance gets its own debate and discussion, and we decide what we think is the best to create the most value. You're welcome. Good morning, Sam. Sam, its Mike. I'm just going to add to what Ray said. I mean, I know your question is depending on where the market goes? But the thing that makes us feel really good about Martinez is several factors. One, we think we have a really competitive CapEx and OpEx situation, and that was one of the major drivers when we looked at this. Second as Ray just mentioned, we have really, really strong logistics; pipeline, rail, water, truck, we have a lot of opportunity there to provide value. And then the ultimate logistics is we're in California, where we're sitting on the demand. So location also matters. So regardless of what happens in the marketplace and it will ebb and flow just like every other commodity market? The reason we're so bullish on our Martinez asset is those factors that are in place day in and day out. The OpEx that we're going to run, the CapEx that it takes to get there, the logistics that we have, the location that we have, all of those play to our favor regardless of how the commodity move day-to-day; I hope that makes sense."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are: Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the Executive Team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina, and thank you for joining our call this morning. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. During the first quarter, our industry continued to struggle with reduction in global economic activity and demand for transportation fuels that resulted from the mobility restrictions related to COVID-19 pandemic. As we started the second quarter, with the rollout of vaccination, we still see industry-wide gasoline demand down around 5% from historical levels and jet demand down around 25% to 30%. To the extent that a pent-up desire to travel starts to brighten the macro-outlook for our business, our team and our assets are poised to take advantage of these opportunities. But in the meantime, as the challenging backdrop holds, we\u2019ll continue to concentrate on the elements of our business that are within our control. Our near-term priorities remain the same. Each quarter, we\u2019re focused on strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance and lowering our cost structure. Slide 4 highlights some of our actions around our strategic priorities this quarter. First, we\u2019re close to completion on the sale of our Speedway business. Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio. Our Board of Directors approved our plans to convert our Martinez assets to a 48,000 barrel per day renewable facility. We expect commissioning of Martinez to begin in the second half of 2022 with approximately 17,000 barrels per day of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 48,000 barrels a day by the end of 2023. In line with our commitment to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, we\u2019re planning to install wind turbine generators at Dickinson facility. Sourcing electricity from wind will lower the carbon intensity of the renewable diesel product at that facility. We\u2019ll continue to seek out the right opportunity for investing and partnering on renewables and evolving technologies.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Slide 8 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.20. Adjusted EBITDA was $1,552 million for the quarter. This includes results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital was $613 million, which is a nearly $500 million increase since the prior quarter. It\u2019s also marked the first time since the start of the pandemic that cash from continuing operations has been above our quarterly dividend payments, which was $379 million. Slide 9 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2020 to first quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $650 million more quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by higher earnings in refining and marketing. As a reminder, both the fourth and first quarter results reflect Speedway as a discontinued operation. Moving to our segment results, Slide 10 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment. The business reported positive EBITDA for the first time since the start of the COVID pandemic with first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $23 million. This was an increase of $725 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, which were considerably improved across all regions in the first quarter, as compared to the fourth quarter. Total utilization for refining was 83%, which was roughly flat with the fourth quarter utilization of 82%.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. We will now open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Doug Leggett with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggett: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike, I wonder if I could ask about the return of cash. I know it\u2019s kind of a routine question that comes up for every quarter. But you talked about the appropriate level of leverage. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s \u2013 how that\u2019s changed or what the latest thinking in there as to what the outlook is like. And then, as a as a kind of follow on to that, when you think about buybacks, how big of a consideration is lowering the dividend burden on the ex-Speedway refining and midstream business? So I\u2019m just, well \u2013 so, basically, debt level and buybacks, I realize MPLX\u2019s share price has  , so that\u2019s probably off the table anyway.\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah, thanks, Doug. I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let Maryann jump in. So throughout this process, we\u2019ve been getting a question about what those appropriate leverage mean. When we pick a metric, we\u2019ve been saying 1 to 1.5 times mid-cycle. And then everybody says, well then what do you think about mid-cycle? And my standard answer is, I don\u2019t think about the 50 yard line, I think about the banks of the river. And I try and do scenario planning around what we think could be good times and bad times. Obviously, everybody is excited about vaccine rollouts and getting recovery here, and certainly the market is moving in that direction. At the same time, Doug, in our prepared remarks, we said, gasoline demand is still 5% lower year-on-year overall. The West Coast is still considerably down compared to the other areas.\nMaryann Mannen: Doug, I think Mike covered it quite comprehensively. Just a couple of other additions, as we continue to say it was our objective and continues to be to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet, as you\u2019ve seen and Mike talked about. Fitch has already confirmed that. So another key variable that we will continue to consider, we want to be sure that the debt repayment is efficient. But other than that, I think Mike has covered the comments quite well. And that, so the only other thing I\u2019d add is, we have committed, we\u2019ve restated it many times that once we get too close, we\u2019ll provide some more details. We\u2019re getting really close. And hopefully that\u2019s not too far away from now. But we\u2019ve been resistant to doing it ahead of time. So we\u2019re just \u2013 soon as we get close, we\u2019ll give a little more color to the market and then continue to communicate the way we have been, I think.\nDoug Leggett: So, Michael, just for clarity, to be clear on my point about dividend, we\u2019re obviously losing substantial cash coverage for dividend. Should we expect some kind of accelerated buyback to accelerate the reduction in that dividend burden, or how are you thinking about that?\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah, big picture, Doug, we believe in our dividend and we think we have a competitive dividend. Obviously, we\u2019re going to reduce share count as a result of this. How that gets reduced is still to be seen, as far as you know the way this lays itself out and where the share price is over time. But we are committed to a competitive dividend. That\u2019s something that we\u2019ve had in our mind all throughout this process. We\u2019ll see at the end of the return, where we end up as far as share count, and then kind of evaluate where we are. But hopefully, the takeaway that you\u2019ve seen from this is we\u2019re committed to our dividend, we do believe in returning capital, we have a nice opportunity here that\u2019s unique as a result of this sale, and that return of capital will be a little bit of a differentiating factor for us for some time here.\nDoug Leggett: Today \u2013 well, thanks for that, Mike. My follow up, I want to be respectful to everyone else. I\u2019ll be real quick here. The cost structure, most likely you\u2019re making big holes or big strides in getting your cost down. But you haven\u2019t talked much about the broader portfolio review or restructuring. One of your competitors suggested the other day that if the RFS doesn\u2019t get resolved one way or the other we could see further rationalization of refining capacity. So I just wonder if you could bring us up to date with the overall portfolio review and stickiness of the cost reductions you\u2019ve achieved so far. Thanks.\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah, Doug, on the portfolio, we decided very early on that 2 two facilities that we idled, we did not see being long-term assets for us. We do have an ongoing portfolio assessment. But we did pause a little bit, because we want to kind of get through this pandemic, and see what the other side looks like and what the new normal looks like. So, we still have ongoing work internally on portfolio, nothing that we\u2019re ready to disclose yet, but a conscious decision on our part to kind of pause, as we went through this pandemic, and start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. And I know everybody\u2019s anxious to get this behind us. And hopefully, we\u2019re getting really close. The vaccine rollouts have gone very well. We\u2019ll get a little better sense of what a new normal looks like and kind of do a final check on what we think about the portfolio in general. But so, in the near-term nothing to announce right now. We\u2019ll get through this new normal. We\u2019ll see what that looks like. But I will tell you, Doug, it\u2019s going to be an ongoing effort on our part, to continue to ask ourselves all the time, where is our cost structure, how\u2019s it evolving, what are the assets that we have in the portfolio, because we are believer that over time this energy evolution will continue to play itself out. And as it does, we\u2019re going to be adapted to the market. And obviously, one of the high priorities that we put on ourselves was to get our cost structure down, so that in our base business, we were in a much more competitive position. And I think we\u2019ve done that to some extent. And that\u2019s not going to be an effort that we give up on. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. In fact, I often get asked the question, what inning are we in in that regard? And, overall, you know, I think, Ray and his team on the refining side are going to continue to look at it. In fact, I\u2019ll let Ray make a comment as to where we are on cost as well. So hopefully, that answers you on portfolio. But let me let Ray make a comment on cost.\nRaymond Brooks: Yeah, Mike brought up about what inning we\u2019re in. And I\u2019d have to say we\u2019re not in the first inning and we\u2019re not in the ninth inning. So we challenge ourselves every day. What can we do to take more discretionary cost out of our system? Hey, the biggest thing that we did early on, and you kind of alluded to that is we took some of our high cost facilities out of the system. And on the West Coast, you have seen that quarter-over-quarter as we idled the Martinez refinery as an oil refinery. And through the subsequent quarters, we completed a majority of the idling costs. And, going forward, Doug, we just continue to look at efficiency cost savings every day, while maintaining our emphasis towards safe and reliable operations for our assets. Those are non-negotiable. Discretionary spending is negotiable.\nDoug Leggett: Thanks, guys.\nMichael Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. I just want to build on some of your comments in the prepared remarks on the Speedway transaction. Mike, it sounds like you\u2019re really close and just want to get some clarity. What really close means from your perspective? Are we talking days? Are we talking months? Are we talking quarters? And in terms of the gating factors, just maybe you talk about what are the things we should be monitoring from a closure perspective?\nMichael Hennigan: And that\u2019s a good way to frame it. I think the best way to answer it is exactly the way you set it up, is what we believe at this point is that we\u2019re in weeks, not months. We\u2019re not days, it\u2019s not going to be tomorrow, the next day, but we think we are down to weeks. And, what we\u2019ve tried to do in this process is to be an intermarried communication tool, because it\u2019s really between the FTC and 7-Eleven. Obviously, we\u2019re at the table trying to understand if we can help the process at all. But, I guess, the best way to describe it is the FTC communicated to us that we\u2019re in the final stage of the process. So with that in mind, we think we\u2019re within weeks. I guess that\u2019s the best way to give you our sense of it. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re months. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re days. But we think we\u2019re very, very close. And that\u2019s why we chose the word close to completion. I hope that helps you. And I know everybody\u2019s anxious for us to get the next set of disclosures relative to this. We\u2019re also anxious to do that. This has been a process. It\u2019s taken a long time. I\u2019m hoping the market appreciates that we tried to be as transparent as we can. We thought for a long time there, we thought we were going to hit by the end of the quarter. That kind of came and went a little bit, process takes a little bit longer sometimes when you get into the details at the end. But we are very, very close. And hopefully, we\u2019re talking within weeks.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah, that conviction comes through, so thank you, that\u2019s great, Mike. And the follow-up is on Martinez. Maybe you could just step back and talk about the renewable diesel project. And if you could level set us sort of how you think about the total capital associated with the project to the extent you can provide it? I think you\u2019ve given the guidance for $350 million of renewable spend this year, but just sort of the total spend associated with the project? And how should we think about the returns associated with this project? And there are a lot of moving pieces, but the biggest fear, I guess, is the soybean prices continue to move higher, so how do you manage the feedstock flexibility to ensure this is a good through-the-cycle investment?\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah, it\u2019s a great question, Neil. And obviously, we\u2019ve communicated that we\u2019ve gotten full Board support for this project. So I\u2019ll let Ray start off, give you some color on how we\u2019re thinking about it. And then, let Brian and Dave jump in as needed on feedstock, et cetera. So go ahead, Ray.\nRaymond Brooks: Sure, Mike. From a project standpoint, I\u2019d like to give a little bit of color on where we stand from a timing schedule standpoint. At this point, Phase 1, we\u2019re targeting completion in the second half of next year 2022. And that would be for 17,000 barrels of renewable fuels coming online. And then, that would be followed up by pretreatment in 2023. And then, finally, the rest of the facility, the back half at 2023 for a total of 48,000 barrels for renewable diesel, renewable fuels production. Now, if I go back to Doug\u2019s comment or question before as far as OpEx, I commented that Martinez was a very high cost oil refinery. But there are some real gems at Martinez that make it a very good project for us from a renewable fuel standpoint, 300 processing units, 2 hydrogen plants, the infrastructure that provides us the ability to have a very cost competitive Brownfield project. And so, I can\u2019t give a lot more CapEx guidance. And you\u2019ve already alluded to, but we\u2019re very excited about this project. And just what we\u2019ve done in the last quarter in Q1, we progressed our engineering work toward the end of definition engineering, and have also made a lot of progress on our permitting efforts with regards to getting the environmental impact report kick-started and out for review in the near-term.\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah, Neil, I\u2019ll turn it over to the commercial guys in a second. Just I guess one way to think about it is there are 3 major hurdles the way we think about this project, do we have the right location and logistics. And obviously, Martinez is sitting on the demand. Dickinson on the other hand is very close to supply. So we like our location and our renewables facilities. Ray just mentioned, the second big hurdle is capital, operating expense, basically, what do you think of the hardware. And Ray just described it, the full asset facility was relatively high cost. But the real gem, as he mentioned, was in the hydroprocessing area. So, it became obvious to us that the best use of this asset was to put it in the service. And then the last piece of the puzzle is the one that\u2019s ongoing and that\u2019s feedstock optimization. And that\u2019ll continue, so I\u2019ll let the guys comment a little bit on that.\nBrian Davis: Okay, hi, it\u2019s Brian Davis here. So maybe just picking up the feedstock question, I think the first thing here is that Ray and his team have done a good job in creating sufficient optionality there through onsite pretreatment over time, but also the capability to receive feedstock by rail as well as by water. So that opens our commercial flexibility quite considerably. We\u2019re evaluating a portfolio of options to give us the right mix of feedstocks, which will deliver value over the life of the project. We have a number of commercial negotiations underway with a wide range of suppliers. And we\u2019ve been leveraging our existing capabilities and relationships, because we have been buying these feedstocks for a period of time for our existing biodiesel, and now more recently for Dickinson.\nNeil Mehta: Okay, thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nMichael Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome, Neil.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Gresh: Yes, hi, good morning. My first question just be on the OpEx results on the West Coast. The OpEx per barrel there was even lower than it was in 2019 despite the fact that utilization is still pretty low here at this point. So maybe you could just, obviously, Martinez, I think is probably out of those numbers now. So maybe that\u2019s the biggest factor. But any other things that we should think about as to the drivers of lower OpEx and how you think about the potential there as utilization ramps back up?\nRaymond Brooks: Okay. I\u2019ll go ahead and take this question. This is Ray. You\u2019re right, Martinez is largely out of the OpEx number. There still is some residual OpEx for tank cleaning and work that we\u2019ll carry on to this year. So there is a little bit of Martinez spend. I will say on the West Coast, Q1, quarter one was a challenging OpEx quarter, primarily because the energy costs put a big demand on us in the last part of February and early March. I will say, on the West Coast, we were partially able to mitigate the impact of those natural gas price spike, by reducing our natural gas purchase requirements to close to balance by producing more internal fuel from our operations. I think this was a real key for us, as far as managing the winter storm, not just in Texas, but across all of our operations. And I really got to give a shout out to our commercial group. Close coordination with our commercial group and the refineries really allowed us to pivot quickly. And on the day one natural gas went up by 100 fold, and adjust our operations, reduce our demand requirement for natural gas, and have as minimal of an impact on our OpEx as possible. So, that was across all of our system. It really was impactful on the West Coast as well. Aside from that, I\u2019ll just go back to what I said earlier, as far as, every day we challenge ourselves, discretionary spending from got-to-do-stay-in-business type of spending. And that\u2019s starting to show in the numbers.\nPhil Gresh: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. My follow-up on renewable diesel, I guess, I\u2019ll just try to glue these together very quickly. If you could just talk about how you feel things are going with the startup, so far Dickinson, what you\u2019ve learned from that startup process? And then, just on the feedstock side of things, would you consider signing up for some kind of joint venture or something like that for soybean crush capacity, like we\u2019ve seen from one of your peers? Is that one of the things you\u2019re considering? Thank you.\nRaymond Brooks: Okay, this is Ray again, and I\u2019ll start off with the first thing as far as what we learn from startup. One of the things we learned, we already knew is that startups are hard. You don\u2019t just push a button and everything works perfectly. But I will tell you, in the first quarter, we achieved 90% of our design capacity at Dickinson. And we also qualified and got a provisional score for our renewable feedstocks, which is soybean oil and corn oil. And, that\u2019s a lower number than the temporary score that we start off with. But as you know, we\u2019re not seeking to get to 90%. We want to get to 100% of capacity and get lower carbon-intensity score. So work has continued in that regard. We work with our licensor for the process and catalyst on a new catalyst formulation. We just actually did that work and it\u2019s come back up. So we\u2019re working towards getting better, getting toward a 100% yield, and exactly what we want from the project.\nBrian Davis: Yeah. And, Phil, it\u2019s Brian here. On your question about soybean crush capacity, et cetera. We\u2019re looking at all options here. Clearly, we\u2019re targeting advantage feedstocks as much as possible, but we think we\u2019ll also \u2013 the industry will need to use soybean oil and its production as well. So, there are certainly considerations for putting in the commercial mix as we understand the right balance between gaining access to the right stage at the right price with security of supply.\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah, Phil, it\u2019s Mike. The only thing I\u2019ll add kind of segue into what Neil had asked is, we really liked the project, Ray describes it well, we think we got really advantage hardware from CapEx and OpEx. We\u2019re concentrating on the feedstock side of the equation now. We\u2019re open to a lot of things, as Brian said, but we\u2019re anxious to get this project online, we think it\u2019s going to be a nice addition to our portfolio. And it really does optimize the assets that were available to us at Martinez, where we\u2019re going to use the really strong ones for hydro processing, and then take out a lot of costs that were part of the facility from a crude processing standpoint.\nPhil Gresh: Great. Thanks.\nMichael Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: Thank you, and good morning.\nMichael Hennigan: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: Just come back and take a shot here at the core refining business. So, like Doug mentioned earlier, the RFS, most of your peers have talked about it as being, RINs are general being quite the headwind to capture. Your capture was actually pretty good, I know, as Speedway is being separated, you\u2019re trying to maintain as much as the owning capacity as possible. I\u2019ll just curious if you could kind of break out maybe how your exposure to RINs is today, either pre or post the spin, and what impact you believe it had on Q1?\nBrian Partee: Yeah, Roger, this is Brian Partee, I can address that question. So consistent with the past, we self-generate about 70% to 75% of our RIN through either   generation or biofuel refining asset. So Q1 was pretty similar to that historical average, as it relates to the separation in Speedway, no real impact there. The RIN is something that\u2019s pretty transparent in the marketplace, it\u2019s a real expense. We all have to deal with it. It\u2019s not something we can control. We think of it like a commodity, we deal with commodity prices that are volatile and move dramatically up and down. And the one thing I\u2019d leave you with on the RIN and the RIN expense, I know, there\u2019s a lot of hyper focus on it and appropriately right now in the environment that we\u2019re in. But, there\u2019s also really good opportunity to optimize in that space, so depending on how you\u2019re modeling and what you\u2019re looking at, you have to think about RIN in terms of true obligated volume, obviously, not all gains are obligated. So if you think about stripping off exports, jet as well as some other   fuels. And for us, Alaska also is not an obligated state from an RVO perspective. The other thing that I think played out interestingly in the market in the first quarter was the year-on-year carry-in. So you can meet obligations in the prompt here with up to 20% of carry-ins from prior year. And, we think there\u2019s far less carry-in from 2020 to 2021, largely due to the uncertainty around the election last fall. So, and then the last part about the commercialization in the RIN space is how you buy and when you buy, I would presume, maybe from a modeling perspective, assume kind of a ratable purchase for RIN. And that could be a strategy. And we try to be very commercial on this space and try to optimize, and obviously, the higher the RIN value gets the more opportunity there is to outperform in conversely underperforming that space.\nRoger Read: Okay. Thanks. Another question I had, again, kind of sticking with the refining side of things. We\u2019re hearing that some of the maintenance in Canada may not happen on quite the same pace, because of the COVID issues up there, which I guess might imply it\u2019s a little more drawn out. But if you think about light, heavy, whether it\u2019s in when U.S. or coastal U.S., what sort of updates can you offer there in terms of crude availability? What you\u2019re seeing expectations on crude differentials?\nRick Hessling: Yeah. Hi, Roger. This is Rick Hessling. So the intel you\u2019re getting in Canada or from Canada is spot on, we\u2019re hearing the same thing. They\u2019ve experienced some startup issues at a couple \u2013 with a couple of their maintenance projects, as well as we\u2019re hearing 1 of the producers specifically is having some COVID issues. So that\u2019s certainly not good for production in Canada. So we\u2019ll continue to watch that specifically to Canada. In terms of differentials in Canada, I would point you towards, I still think, probably, your general rule of thumb is the forward market there, which is plus or minus $12. And the incremental barrel in Canada is moving out via rail, the pipes are full, so we expect that to continue. When you look worldwide and more so on the Gulf Coast, a lot of \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of conversation around OPEC and the barrels that they\u2019re releasing into the market. I\u2019m a little more measured on OPEC, and what we might expect on the Gulf Coast than others. Quite frankly, when you look at what OPEC has done in the last several months, they\u2019ve been very measured on how they\u2019re managing their production with demand. And currently today, as you know, we\u2019ve got a tug of war. There\u2019s a little bit of slight optimism coming out of the West. And then there\u2019s a lot of the fear of the unknown, which is well publicized in India, so we\u2019ll just have to see how that plays out.\nRoger Read: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: Hi, in your prepared remarks, you did indicate that while the demand is recovering, it\u2019s the recovery \u2013 the pace of recovery is lower on the West Coast. I think, California is going for a full reopen around mid-June. So I\u2019m just trying to understand going forward, do you see an improved demand recovery based on a full reopen in California?\nBrian Partee: Yeah, Manav, this is Brian Partee, I can take that one. So, what I would say, it\u2019s kind of reiterate Mike\u2019s points that he made in his opening remarks. We have seen gasoline demand really grind back across the entire portfolio certainly the West Coast has lagged. In the East, we\u2019ve been running over the last several weeks 2% to 5% off of 2019 comps. In the West, it\u2019s been more in the 18, call it, high teens to low 20s. But we have seen a gradual grind back from the early part of this year, and you\u2019re spot on, yes, California is prepared to reopen here mid-June. And just looking at some of the vaccination data and just anecdotal discussions in the market, we do expect meaningful recoveries through the summer months to what extent is very difficult to estimate. COVID has been a very dynamic environment for us, California has been very aggressive. So I\u2019m really hesitant to make a call on where we expected to go. But we\u2019ve seen favorable trends in other markets, as we\u2019ve gotten back off and opened up the economies, we\u2019d expect to see a degree of the same out in the West Coast.\nMichael Hennigan: Manav, it\u2019s Mike. The other thing that I would add is kind of what I said earlier is, once we get through this, and a lot of these states open up, I mean, California, as Brian just mentioned, a major indicator as to where you know that that market is going to be. But, Florida, New Jersey, New York, some other big gasoline consuming states are also in the process of reopening. The question becomes, where do we end up after that point? One of the things that I think we still need to see is there potential pent-up demand, is that one of the things that we\u2019re going to see coming out of this, is there going to be a new normal with the way people operate as far as working remote operations, et cetera, et cetera. So, we\u2019re excited that it continues to get better. But we\u2019re also cautious as to what it\u2019s going to mean, once we get to the other side of this. If anything, I would say, the way we try to think about it is, at the end of the day, vaccines are rolling out well, states are opening up, things are heading in the right direction to what absolute number is Brian just mentioned, where that ends up is still to be played out. And to your point, June, like you said, it\u2019s going to occur in June, it\u2019s essentially the second quarter will be over, we\u2019ll be talking about results here, where we still don\u2019t really have as much insight yet. So I think, it\u2019s still going to play out a little bit more time, understand that pent-up demand, how much of it is robust to stay long-term, and how much of it is just short-term for people trying to get out from under the lockdown condition. So still a lot to learn, like I said, we concentrate on what we control, we\u2019ll keep an eye on what we don\u2019t control, and try and learn as much as we can as to what the new normal looks like.\nManav Gupta: Mike, 1 quick follow-up here, we saw you\u2019re putting in some wind turbines on the Dickinson refinery to lower the carbon intensity. Clearly, you guys are focusing a lot on carbon intensity, and one on some of what your peers and others are doing is carbon capture and sequestration. Is it something which the MPC could look at potentially to further lower the carbon intensity of both gasoline and diesel that is producing in its refineries?\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah, Manav, I think, I\u2019ll let Brian and Dave jump in there. But, we are obviously cognizant of the value of lowering the carbon intensity of the operations of the product, et cetera. The wind situation is their concern, right, if you want to give a little more color there, or Dave if you want to give a total color on lowering carbon.\nBrian Davis: Yeah, just to give you a little bit more detail on Dickinson and what we\u2019re doing with the carbon intensity. The first thing that you mentioned is wind turbine, so that\u2019s a project that we\u2019re planning to go ahead with in 2022, to put enough wind turbines in there to provide about 50% of our electricity demand via renewable electricity, and that lowers the carbon intensity. The other thing that that we\u2019re doing is we\u2019ve got feed pretreatments now down at Beatrice, and that plant has started up that material has made its way to Dickinson. And so we now have pretreated corn oil that\u2019s significant from a carbon intensity standpoint, that one it\u2019s pretty treated, so it processes better. Secondly, it\u2019s significantly lower carbon intensity than soybean oil.\nDavid Heppner: Yes, this is David Heppner, just another comment would be, whether it be wind turbines or carbon capture and sequestration, those are all additional complimentary technologies to increase the value of the Dickinson project by lowering in CI. There\u2019s other technologies such as renewable natural gas, solar and other technologies, we\u2019re continuing to evaluate and will implement those if and when they make sense for us.\nManav Gupta: Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, guys.\nMichael Hennigan: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: I have 2 questions. If we\u2019re looking at your cost structure, what are you put refining OpEx, the distribution costs and the corporate costs together or individually? They work really well in the first quarter. And you have done a great job there. I just curious that when I looking at your total throughput guidance is higher? Natural gas cost is lower in the second quarter, is there any reason, you said just being conservative or does a someone of reason why the second quarter unit cost upon in your refining actually going to be higher, and your OpEx costs and the distribution cost is also going to be higher? So that\u2019s the first question. The second question is that going back into the ESG with the energy transition, what\u2019s the longer term plan or objective? Are you going to take the initiative, essentially just trying to lower your own emission in CI, or that you\u2019re looking at it as an opportunity for you to expand and perhaps that even create a new line of business, and also on the renewable on the pit stop, and your \u2013 one of your largest competitor, put all their renewable diesel into a joint venture and partner with someone expertise in the feedstock supply? Why that\u2019s not a good idea for you guys? Thank you.\nMaryann Mannen: It\u2019s Maryann, let me try to address your first question around the second quarter guidance and certainly as compared to the first quarter. Just maybe as a bit of a reminder, we are expecting volumes to be up slightly from the first quarter about 2.7 million barrels per day, as you spoke about the distribution costs 1.25 is the expectation for the second quarter again up slightly, we are expecting some higher product demand and therefore obviously some higher costs to transport product, but overall, fairly flattish if we look at the increase in the expectation for throughput. And then, similarly, when you look at total operating costs really on a per barrel basis, when you consider that there are about flattish Q1 to Q2. So, hope that helps to address your questions there around the nature of the second quarter guidance. Mike has cleared for you sort of how we\u2019re thinking about the second quarter, obviously, things can play out just depending on how the demand and recovery happens. But hopefully that addresses your question, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Maryann, I\u2019m sorry, but that your unique cost is actually higher in your guidance in the second quarter. That\u2019s even on the distribution side on the distribution costs comparing to the first quarter. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure you said we have some one-off issue that\u2019s why that you expect the unit cost on a per barrel throughput going higher, because one would imagine that with their higher throughput volume and lower energy costs that per unit cost should be going lower, not going higher.\nMaryann Mannen: Yeah, Paul, it\u2019s Maryann again. So you\u2019re right, when we talk about total operating costs based on that demand, it\u2019s about $5.20 versus the quarter, which was about $5.16. I was saying about flat, but you\u2019re right, that there is a slight kick-up as we think about those total operating costs. And then distribution costs, hopefully, I tried to address the key elements there that were drivers to the higher cost.\nMichael Hennigan: Paul, it\u2019s Mike. On your second point, I think, it\u2019s a combination of cost and portfolio. As Ray mentioned earlier, one of the things that we accomplished to kind of got, 2 birds with 1 stone is, Martinez was 1 of our highest cost facilities, Gallup was 1 of our highest cost facilities. So we want to have when we\u2019re processing fossil fuels, a very competitive low cost system, because it\u2019s going to be around for a long time. And we want to make sure that we create value in that regard. At the same time, the energy evolution is going to kick into renewables and other technologies as they develop. So we found a nice opportunity. We\u2019re very pleased with the effort that\u2019s going on at Dickinson. And as Dave just mentioned, once we\u2019re in that both, we\u2019re going to try and do everything we can to increase the profitability, whether it\u2019s lowering the carbon intensity, the operation, the product of feedstocks, it was Brian mentioned. And I\u2019ll let Brian comment, as like I said earlier is, location is in a good spot for us, CapEx is in a good spot for us, OpEx is in a good spot for us. Ray\u2019s going through some learnings on the startup on the 1 facility, which will help us on the next facility. And then the last piece to your fossil was feedstock. And I\u2019ll let Brian reiterate, but I will tell you, we\u2019d like our base plan, we feel very comfortable that we have a really good project in front of us. But we are continuing to challenge ourselves, is there a way to increase value there?\nBrian Partee: Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yes, as we build out the feedstock procurement strategy and create more options, we\u2019re certainly looking at partners along the entire value chain, all the way from the procurement of feedstock onwards. And we are considering where we can do more with partners than just only commercial arrangement. But I think, we still want to let those discussions play out. And whatever we do needs to make sense for them, and obviously makes sense for us as well from a value perspective.\nPaul Cheng: And, Mike, you also address that on the longer term, do you see the energy transition. We create a new line of business for you? Or that you\u2019re looking at all the initiative is just to reducing your emission in CI for your own existing operation?\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah, I don\u2019t think of it as either, Paul, I think of it is somewhat both, we\u2019re going to have an opportunity as this transition, I like to call it evolution evolves. There\u2019s going to be some technologies that we can implement in our existing fossil fuel facilities that will be helpful. There\u2019s going to be some technologies didn\u2019t get implemented in truly renewable facilities. So I think in time, you\u2019re going to see us grow both, and at the end \u2013 what\u2019s the end game is what you\u2019re asking, and I don\u2019t know how long you\u2019re thinking out in time. But, the end game is, for us to have a very competitive refining offering of fossil fuels in a very competitive offering on renewable fuels, and continue to look for ways to grow our earnings. Dave mentioned it, we\u2019re looking at a lot of different things right at the moment, we\u2019re going to act on them, and once we believe that they will give a good return for us, some things I think are a little ahead of their time right at the moment, the technology still needs to develop a little bit. At the same time, there\u2019s some things like Ray just mentioned, we\u2019re going to implement some \u2013 wind support to our Dickinson facility as early as next year. So some things are on the immediate side, some things are on the watch side and evaluate, we\u2019re going to have a very robust look at through all this. One of the things that everybody keeps asking me, and hopefully, you\u2019ll get to see it through results is what are we doing commercially? It\u2019s one of my goals is to improve our commercial performance. And it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re going to talk about in the forecasting of it, but hopefully, we\u2019ll point out things, as we go along, and Ray mentioned a couple today, that happened in the first quarter that helped us minimize our impact around the winter storm. So I think you\u2019re going to see the answer to your question is really both, there\u2019s going to be some opportunities on both sides of the business as we change the portfolio over time, and that was asked earlier today, you\u2019re going to see some more changes in the portfolio as time goes by. And as we get to evaluate that will give disclosures as quickly as we can survey knows, which way we\u2019re pointing the company.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nMichael Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nPrashant Rao: Hi, thanks for taking the question. My questions are both on R&M, and specifically on CapEx. First on Martinez, I know, you can\u2019t disclose an overall cost. But Mike, I was wondering, in terms of cadence at $350 million this year. And it sounds like you do the first diesel hydrotreater next year. And then the 3 other hydros in the pretreat come on in 2023. So, is it right to think about it as sort of a stair step that the CapEx for that, and therefore the R&M growth CapEx kind of steps up in terms of renewables next year, and in 2023 years, it\u2019s sort of more evenly spread out. And sort of related to that, just wanted to check that, would that be funded purely from internally generated cash or would you be looking to, I think, what are your financing sort of options if you \u2013 how you fund the project? And then I have a follow-up.\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah, Prashant, I think you\u2019re thinking about it, right. It is a phased approach to the activity out there, but it kind of dovetails to what Paul just asked. So when you step back and think about it, roughly some-40% let me around half of the growth capital that we have in this year is directed towards renewables. But then also half of it is directed towards our fossil fuel business. So we still think there\u2019s going to be continuing moneys that we can spend in that business. So like what Paul was asking, I was trying to say, we\u2019re going to do a little bit of both. But I think you\u2019re also seeing the way we\u2019re approaching this project, which is in a phased approach. So as Ray mentioned, we\u2019ll get it online early next year, pretreatment comes on full capacity comes on. So there will be some stair stepping and capital in that area. At the same time, we\u2019re still looking forward to the $450 million that we\u2019re investing in the base business. We still got some activity going on down on the Gulf Coast, with our STAR project that we want to get to the finish line as well. So, kind of dovetail to your question, the same as Paul\u2019s, is that \u2013 we\u2019re going to have activity occurring in both areas, we\u2019re committed to both sides of the business, because it\u2019s going to be a long evolution, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to happen very quickly. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to be very attentive to, as to where we deploy capital, I\u2019m hoping everybody\u2019s getting a feel for us that we\u2019re going to have a strict capital discipline, that\u2019s a mantra that we\u2019re going to continue to push and challenge ourselves through all this scenario planning that we do is to what\u2019s the best use of that capital, whether it\u2019s in our existing facilities and fossil fuels or in renewable facilities or, as Paul mentioned, if we come up with something that we think is a little bit more of a step out. So we\u2019ll try and give everybody as much disclosure as we can, as time goes by. We\u2019re looking forward to the opportunity, as the evolution continues, and we think it\u2019ll provide us some value opportunities to increase value for the shareholders.\nPrashant Rao: Great. And then, sort of related to, I guess, the second part of my question there was on, how you expect to fund projects, because it sounds like this is going to be a very large facility at Martinez. But you also have a ramp here in terms of cash flow generation, potentially internally generated, so I just wanted to get a sense of this, broadly speaking, expect to fund Martinez out of operating cash that you generate, or if they\u2019re \u2013 if you were to finance it, would you look at project financing, or what would be some of the options in terms of how you fund the build on the project?\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah, Prashant, so our base plan, obviously, assuming the market cooperates, as we want to fund it out of operating cash. We don\u2019t want to get discolored with Speedway, earnings, and we\u2019ll get more color on that, that return to capital is kind of separate. And hopefully, as everybody is anticipating as the market kind of comes back to a normal. We\u2019ll be generating operating cash that will fund our capital program, funds our dividend, hopefully have access beyond that, that will have optionality beyond that as well.\nPrashant Rao: Okay, great. And, just one last follow-up real quick, on the maintenance side, I think you guided to about $250 million this year in R&M. A little early I know to answer this, Mike, but any color on how you think about that maintenance number in R&M on a sort of a through-cycle basis? When we get volumes back up, and as we look at MPC being \u2013 the years coming ahead, is that $250 million not that far off from how you\u2019re looking at maintenance costs, now that you\u2019ve rationalized cost across the structure, and you will continue to do so? Or is it so you were thinking that this is sort of a low year and there should be a little bit more that we need to layer in as we think about next year and maybe beyond?\nRaymond Brooks: Yeah, let me take a shot at that. This is Ray. When I talked earlier about looking at the needs versus want. So, certainly the maintenance CapEx is along that line. So we challenge ourselves every day to the point of where we are, whether it\u2019s OpEx or CapEx, as far as really scrutinizing the spend. So, our goal is not to go grossly up on maintenance CapEx.\nPrashant Rao: Perfect. Thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it.\nMichael Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Your line is open.\nRyan Todd: Great, thanks. Maybe just one quick one on the refining side. Your utilization guidance for the second quarter is probably a little more conservative in terms of sequential improvement relative to some of your peers. I mean, your commentary\u2019s maybe been a little more cautious. Is that \u2013 how do you think about ramping utilization over the next couple of months? And is there a potential upside of your 2Q guidance there?\nMichael Hennigan: Yeah. I think Brian alluded to it early on is, we have these states that have a lot of impact to gasoline, the West Coast being one of them. They\u2019re all talking about going into the next phase of opening up. We just don\u2019t know how to totally gauge what that means. Manav mentioned June for the West Coast. We\u2019ll see if it turns out to be June or not. I mean, we got to get through the rest of May. So, I mean, we\u2019re doing our best to try and forecast that. But I try and remind everybody that, we don\u2019t have control of that. We\u2019re just like everybody else monitoring the situation, and given our best assessment, but there\u2019s a lot of key states that are saying they\u2019re going to be opening up. I mentioned a few in New York, New Jersey, Florida, on the East Coast. Obviously, the West Coast, has been under the most restrictions. Brian mentioned 20% down year-on-year, when overall, you\u2019re about 5%, down on gasoline. So it\u2019s a pretty bifurcated situation right now. And we\u2019ll just have to see how it plays out. And, obviously, we try and give you the best guidance we can. And then, as the results come in, we\u2019ll give you kind of a post-audit of what things look like.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. Maybe a quick follow-up on Dickinson. I guess, as you think about the \u2013 I know, you have the pretreatment up and going for some of the corn oil. Do you have, I mean, is there a SOP for what you think to kind of an average mix might look like in terms of vegetable oil versus corn oil, that facility, and an estimate, and maybe what you think the average CI value of the product will be once the wind facilities are up and running?\nRaymond Brooks: Sure, this is Ray. The design basis for the project is 10,000 barrels a day of soybean oil, and 2000 barrels of corn oil, treated corn oil. So that\u2019s the goal. That\u2019s where we\u2019re headed to get as we get into the second quarter. Just a little bit about the CI value, the target CI value for soybean oil is going to be in the mid-50s. And take about 30 numbers off that for corn oil. So that\u2019s the range you need to be thinking about from a carbon intensity standpoint.\nRyan Todd: And how much do you think you can \u2013 how meaningful is the wind energy in terms of \u2013 is that assuming the wind energy or can you knock a few more points off with that project?\nMichael Hennigan: Brian, I would tell you, let us get that up and running, and we\u2019ll be happy to give you some feedback after that. But we don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity. But we don\u2019t want to predetermine how effective we\u2019re going to be there. We\u2019re excited about it. But let us get it up and running and we\u2019ll give you more color.\nRyan Todd: Awesome.

            "name": "Brian Davis",
            "content": "Okay, hi, it's Brian Davis here. So maybe just picking up the feedstock question, I think the first thing here is that Ray and his team have done a good job in creating sufficient optionality there through onsite pretreatment over time, but also the capability to receive feedstock by rail as well as by water. So that opens our commercial flexibility quite considerably. We're evaluating a portfolio of options to give us the right mix of feedstocks, which will deliver value over the life of the project. We have a number of commercial negotiations underway with a wide range of suppliers. And we've been leveraging our existing capabilities and relationships, because we have been buying these feedstocks for a period of time for our existing biodiesel, and now more recently for Dickinson. Yeah. And, Phil, it's Brian here. On your question about soybean crush capacity, et cetera. We're looking at all options here. Clearly, we're targeting advantage feedstocks as much as possible, but we think we'll also \u2013 the industry will need to use soybean oil and its production as well. So, there are certainly considerations for putting in the commercial mix as we understand the right balance between gaining access to the right stage at the right price with security of supply. Yeah, just to give you a little bit more detail on Dickinson and what we're doing with the carbon intensity. The first thing that you mentioned is wind turbine, so that's a project that we're planning to go ahead with in 2022, to put enough wind turbines in there to provide about 50% of our electricity demand via renewable electricity, and that lowers the carbon intensity. The other thing that that we're doing is we've got feed pretreatments now down at Beatrice, and that plant has started up that material has made its way to Dickinson. And so we now have pretreated corn oil that's significant from a carbon intensity standpoint, that one it's pretty treated, so it processes better. Secondly, it's significantly lower carbon intensity than soybean oil."

            "name": "Brian Partee",
            "content": "Yeah, Roger, this is Brian Partee, I can address that question. So consistent with the past, we self-generate about 70% to 75% of our RIN through either   generation or biofuel refining asset. So Q1 was pretty similar to that historical average, as it relates to the separation in Speedway, no real impact there. The RIN is something that's pretty transparent in the marketplace, it's a real expense. We all have to deal with it. It's not something we can control. We think of it like a commodity, we deal with commodity prices that are volatile and move dramatically up and down. And the one thing I'd leave you with on the RIN and the RIN expense, I know, there's a lot of hyper focus on it and appropriately right now in the environment that we're in. But, there's also really good opportunity to optimize in that space, so depending on how you're modeling and what you're looking at, you have to think about RIN in terms of true obligated volume, obviously, not all gains are obligated. So if you think about stripping off exports, jet as well as some other   fuels. And for us, Alaska also is not an obligated state from an RVO perspective. The other thing that I think played out interestingly in the market in the first quarter was the year-on-year carry-in. So you can meet obligations in the prompt here with up to 20% of carry-ins from prior year. And, we think there's far less carry-in from 2020 to 2021, largely due to the uncertainty around the election last fall. So, and then the last part about the commercialization in the RIN space is how you buy and when you buy, I would presume, maybe from a modeling perspective, assume kind of a ratable purchase for RIN. And that could be a strategy. And we try to be very commercial on this space and try to optimize, and obviously, the higher the RIN value gets the more opportunity there is to outperform in conversely underperforming that space. Yeah, Manav, this is Brian Partee, I can take that one. So, what I would say, it's kind of reiterate Mike's points that he made in his opening remarks. We have seen gasoline demand really grind back across the entire portfolio certainly the West Coast has lagged. In the East, we've been running over the last several weeks 2% to 5% off of 2019 comps. In the West, it's been more in the 18, call it, high teens to low 20s. But we have seen a gradual grind back from the early part of this year, and you're spot on, yes, California is prepared to reopen here mid-June. And just looking at some of the vaccination data and just anecdotal discussions in the market, we do expect meaningful recoveries through the summer months to what extent is very difficult to estimate. COVID has been a very dynamic environment for us, California has been very aggressive. So I'm really hesitant to make a call on where we expected to go. But we've seen favorable trends in other markets, as we've gotten back off and opened up the economies, we'd expect to see a degree of the same out in the West Coast. Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yes, as we build out the feedstock procurement strategy and create more options, we're certainly looking at partners along the entire value chain, all the way from the procurement of feedstock onwards. And we are considering where we can do more with partners than just only commercial arrangement. But I think, we still want to let those discussions play out. And whatever we do needs to make sense for them, and obviously makes sense for us as well from a value perspective."

            "name": "Michael Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina, and thank you for joining our call this morning. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. During the first quarter, our industry continued to struggle with reduction in global economic activity and demand for transportation fuels that resulted from the mobility restrictions related to COVID-19 pandemic. As we started the second quarter, with the rollout of vaccination, we still see industry-wide gasoline demand down around 5% from historical levels and jet demand down around 25% to 30%. To the extent that a pent-up desire to travel starts to brighten the macro-outlook for our business, our team and our assets are poised to take advantage of these opportunities. But in the meantime, as the challenging backdrop holds, we'll continue to concentrate on the elements of our business that are within our control. Our near-term priorities remain the same. Each quarter, we're focused on strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance and lowering our cost structure. Slide 4 highlights some of our actions around our strategic priorities this quarter. First, we're close to completion on the sale of our Speedway business. Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio. Our Board of Directors approved our plans to convert our Martinez assets to a 48,000 barrel per day renewable facility. We expect commissioning of Martinez to begin in the second half of 2022 with approximately 17,000 barrels per day of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 48,000 barrels a day by the end of 2023. In line with our commitment to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, we're planning to install wind turbine generators at Dickinson facility. Sourcing electricity from wind will lower the carbon intensity of the renewable diesel product at that facility. We'll continue to seek out the right opportunity for investing and partnering on renewables and evolving technologies. Yeah, thanks, Doug. I'll start and I'll let Maryann jump in. So throughout this process, we've been getting a question about what those appropriate leverage mean. When we pick a metric, we've been saying 1 to 1.5 times mid-cycle. And then everybody says, well then what do you think about mid-cycle? And my standard answer is, I don't think about the 50 yard line, I think about the banks of the river. And I try and do scenario planning around what we think could be good times and bad times. Obviously, everybody is excited about vaccine rollouts and getting recovery here, and certainly the market is moving in that direction. At the same time, Doug, in our prepared remarks, we said, gasoline demand is still 5% lower year-on-year overall. The West Coast is still considerably down compared to the other areas. Yeah, big picture, Doug, we believe in our dividend and we think we have a competitive dividend. Obviously, we're going to reduce share count as a result of this. How that gets reduced is still to be seen, as far as you know the way this lays itself out and where the share price is over time. But we are committed to a competitive dividend. That's something that we've had in our mind all throughout this process. We'll see at the end of the return, where we end up as far as share count, and then kind of evaluate where we are. But hopefully, the takeaway that you've seen from this is we're committed to our dividend, we do believe in returning capital, we have a nice opportunity here that's unique as a result of this sale, and that return of capital will be a little bit of a differentiating factor for us for some time here. Yeah, Doug, on the portfolio, we decided very early on that 2 two facilities that we idled, we did not see being long-term assets for us. We do have an ongoing portfolio assessment. But we did pause a little bit, because we want to kind of get through this pandemic, and see what the other side looks like and what the new normal looks like. So, we still have ongoing work internally on portfolio, nothing that we're ready to disclose yet, but a conscious decision on our part to kind of pause, as we went through this pandemic, and start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. And I know everybody's anxious to get this behind us. And hopefully, we're getting really close. The vaccine rollouts have gone very well. We'll get a little better sense of what a new normal looks like and kind of do a final check on what we think about the portfolio in general. But so, in the near-term nothing to announce right now. We'll get through this new normal. We'll see what that looks like. But I will tell you, Doug, it's going to be an ongoing effort on our part, to continue to ask ourselves all the time, where is our cost structure, how's it evolving, what are the assets that we have in the portfolio, because we are believer that over time this energy evolution will continue to play itself out. And as it does, we're going to be adapted to the market. And obviously, one of the high priorities that we put on ourselves was to get our cost structure down, so that in our base business, we were in a much more competitive position. And I think we've done that to some extent. And that's not going to be an effort that we give up on. We're going to continue to do that. In fact, I often get asked the question, what inning are we in in that regard? And, overall, you know, I think, Ray and his team on the refining side are going to continue to look at it. In fact, I'll let Ray make a comment as to where we are on cost as well. So hopefully, that answers you on portfolio. But let me let Ray make a comment on cost. You're welcome, Doug. And that's a good way to frame it. I think the best way to answer it is exactly the way you set it up, is what we believe at this point is that we're in weeks, not months. We're not days, it's not going to be tomorrow, the next day, but we think we are down to weeks. And, what we've tried to do in this process is to be an intermarried communication tool, because it's really between the FTC and 7-Eleven. Obviously, we're at the table trying to understand if we can help the process at all. But, I guess, the best way to describe it is the FTC communicated to us that we're in the final stage of the process. So with that in mind, we think we're within weeks. I guess that's the best way to give you our sense of it. We don't think we're months. We don't think we're days. But we think we're very, very close. And that's why we chose the word close to completion. I hope that helps you. And I know everybody's anxious for us to get the next set of disclosures relative to this. We're also anxious to do that. This has been a process. It's taken a long time. I'm hoping the market appreciates that we tried to be as transparent as we can. We thought for a long time there, we thought we were going to hit by the end of the quarter. That kind of came and went a little bit, process takes a little bit longer sometimes when you get into the details at the end. But we are very, very close. And hopefully, we're talking within weeks. Yeah, it's a great question, Neil. And obviously, we've communicated that we've gotten full Board support for this project. So I'll let Ray start off, give you some color on how we're thinking about it. And then, let Brian and Dave jump in as needed on feedstock, et cetera. So go ahead, Ray. Yeah, Neil, I'll turn it over to the commercial guys in a second. Just I guess one way to think about it is there are 3 major hurdles the way we think about this project, do we have the right location and logistics. And obviously, Martinez is sitting on the demand. Dickinson on the other hand is very close to supply. So we like our location and our renewables facilities. Ray just mentioned, the second big hurdle is capital, operating expense, basically, what do you think of the hardware. And Ray just described it, the full asset facility was relatively high cost. But the real gem, as he mentioned, was in the hydroprocessing area. So, it became obvious to us that the best use of this asset was to put it in the service. And then the last piece of the puzzle is the one that's ongoing and that's feedstock optimization. And that'll continue, so I'll let the guys comment a little bit on that. You're welcome, Neil. Yeah, Phil, it's Mike. The only thing I'll add kind of segue into what Neil had asked is, we really liked the project, Ray describes it well, we think we got really advantage hardware from CapEx and OpEx. We're concentrating on the feedstock side of the equation now. We're open to a lot of things, as Brian said, but we're anxious to get this project online, we think it's going to be a nice addition to our portfolio. And it really does optimize the assets that were available to us at Martinez, where we're going to use the really strong ones for hydro processing, and then take out a lot of costs that were part of the facility from a crude processing standpoint. You're welcome. Good morning, Roger. You're welcome. Manav, it's Mike. The other thing that I would add is kind of what I said earlier is, once we get through this, and a lot of these states open up, I mean, California, as Brian just mentioned, a major indicator as to where you know that that market is going to be. But, Florida, New Jersey, New York, some other big gasoline consuming states are also in the process of reopening. The question becomes, where do we end up after that point? One of the things that I think we still need to see is there potential pent-up demand, is that one of the things that we're going to see coming out of this, is there going to be a new normal with the way people operate as far as working remote operations, et cetera, et cetera. So, we're excited that it continues to get better. But we're also cautious as to what it's going to mean, once we get to the other side of this. If anything, I would say, the way we try to think about it is, at the end of the day, vaccines are rolling out well, states are opening up, things are heading in the right direction to what absolute number is Brian just mentioned, where that ends up is still to be played out. And to your point, June, like you said, it's going to occur in June, it's essentially the second quarter will be over, we'll be talking about results here, where we still don't really have as much insight yet. So I think, it's still going to play out a little bit more time, understand that pent-up demand, how much of it is robust to stay long-term, and how much of it is just short-term for people trying to get out from under the lockdown condition. So still a lot to learn, like I said, we concentrate on what we control, we'll keep an eye on what we don't control, and try and learn as much as we can as to what the new normal looks like. Yeah, Manav, I think, I'll let Brian and Dave jump in there. But, we are obviously cognizant of the value of lowering the carbon intensity of the operations of the product, et cetera. The wind situation is their concern, right, if you want to give a little more color there, or Dave if you want to give a total color on lowering carbon. Good morning, Paul. Paul, it's Mike. On your second point, I think, it's a combination of cost and portfolio. As Ray mentioned earlier, one of the things that we accomplished to kind of got, 2 birds with 1 stone is, Martinez was 1 of our highest cost facilities, Gallup was 1 of our highest cost facilities. So we want to have when we're processing fossil fuels, a very competitive low cost system, because it's going to be around for a long time. And we want to make sure that we create value in that regard. At the same time, the energy evolution is going to kick into renewables and other technologies as they develop. So we found a nice opportunity. We're very pleased with the effort that's going on at Dickinson. And as Dave just mentioned, once we're in that both, we're going to try and do everything we can to increase the profitability, whether it's lowering the carbon intensity, the operation, the product of feedstocks, it was Brian mentioned. And I'll let Brian comment, as like I said earlier is, location is in a good spot for us, CapEx is in a good spot for us, OpEx is in a good spot for us. Ray's going through some learnings on the startup on the 1 facility, which will help us on the next facility. And then the last piece to your fossil was feedstock. And I'll let Brian reiterate, but I will tell you, we'd like our base plan, we feel very comfortable that we have a really good project in front of us. But we are continuing to challenge ourselves, is there a way to increase value there? Yeah, I don't think of it as either, Paul, I think of it is somewhat both, we're going to have an opportunity as this transition, I like to call it evolution evolves. There's going to be some technologies that we can implement in our existing fossil fuel facilities that will be helpful. There's going to be some technologies didn't get implemented in truly renewable facilities. So I think in time, you're going to see us grow both, and at the end \u2013 what's the end game is what you're asking, and I don't know how long you're thinking out in time. But, the end game is, for us to have a very competitive refining offering of fossil fuels in a very competitive offering on renewable fuels, and continue to look for ways to grow our earnings. Dave mentioned it, we're looking at a lot of different things right at the moment, we're going to act on them, and once we believe that they will give a good return for us, some things I think are a little ahead of their time right at the moment, the technology still needs to develop a little bit. At the same time, there's some things like Ray just mentioned, we're going to implement some \u2013 wind support to our Dickinson facility as early as next year. So some things are on the immediate side, some things are on the watch side and evaluate, we're going to have a very robust look at through all this. One of the things that everybody keeps asking me, and hopefully, you'll get to see it through results is what are we doing commercially? It's one of my goals is to improve our commercial performance. And it's not something that we're going to talk about in the forecasting of it, but hopefully, we'll point out things, as we go along, and Ray mentioned a couple today, that happened in the first quarter that helped us minimize our impact around the winter storm. So I think you're going to see the answer to your question is really both, there's going to be some opportunities on both sides of the business as we change the portfolio over time, and that was asked earlier today, you're going to see some more changes in the portfolio as time goes by. And as we get to evaluate that will give disclosures as quickly as we can survey knows, which way we're pointing the company. You're welcome. Yeah, Prashant, I think you're thinking about it, right. It is a phased approach to the activity out there, but it kind of dovetails to what Paul just asked. So when you step back and think about it, roughly some-40% let me around half of the growth capital that we have in this year is directed towards renewables. But then also half of it is directed towards our fossil fuel business. So we still think there's going to be continuing moneys that we can spend in that business. So like what Paul was asking, I was trying to say, we're going to do a little bit of both. But I think you're also seeing the way we're approaching this project, which is in a phased approach. So as Ray mentioned, we'll get it online early next year, pretreatment comes on full capacity comes on. So there will be some stair stepping and capital in that area. At the same time, we're still looking forward to the $450 million that we're investing in the base business. We still got some activity going on down on the Gulf Coast, with our STAR project that we want to get to the finish line as well. So, kind of dovetail to your question, the same as Paul's, is that \u2013 we're going to have activity occurring in both areas, we're committed to both sides of the business, because it's going to be a long evolution, it's not something that's going to happen very quickly. But it's something that we're going to be very attentive to, as to where we deploy capital, I'm hoping everybody's getting a feel for us that we're going to have a strict capital discipline, that's a mantra that we're going to continue to push and challenge ourselves through all this scenario planning that we do is to what's the best use of that capital, whether it's in our existing facilities and fossil fuels or in renewable facilities or, as Paul mentioned, if we come up with something that we think is a little bit more of a step out. So we'll try and give everybody as much disclosure as we can, as time goes by. We're looking forward to the opportunity, as the evolution continues, and we think it'll provide us some value opportunities to increase value for the shareholders. Yeah, Prashant, so our base plan, obviously, assuming the market cooperates, as we want to fund it out of operating cash. We don't want to get discolored with Speedway, earnings, and we'll get more color on that, that return to capital is kind of separate. And hopefully, as everybody is anticipating as the market kind of comes back to a normal. We'll be generating operating cash that will fund our capital program, funds our dividend, hopefully have access beyond that, that will have optionality beyond that as well. You're welcome. Yeah. I think Brian alluded to it early on is, we have these states that have a lot of impact to gasoline, the West Coast being one of them. They're all talking about going into the next phase of opening up. We just don't know how to totally gauge what that means. Manav mentioned June for the West Coast. We'll see if it turns out to be June or not. I mean, we got to get through the rest of May. So, I mean, we're doing our best to try and forecast that. But I try and remind everybody that, we don't have control of that. We're just like everybody else monitoring the situation, and given our best assessment, but there's a lot of key states that are saying they're going to be opening up. I mentioned a few in New York, New Jersey, Florida, on the East Coast. Obviously, the West Coast, has been under the most restrictions. Brian mentioned 20% down year-on-year, when overall, you're about 5%, down on gasoline. So it's a pretty bifurcated situation right now. And we'll just have to see how it plays out. And, obviously, we try and give you the best guidance we can. And then, as the results come in, we'll give you kind of a post-audit of what things look like. Brian, I would tell you, let us get that up and running, and we'll be happy to give you some feedback after that. But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're excited about the opportunity. But we don't want to predetermine how effective we're going to be there. We're excited about it. But let us get it up and running and we'll give you more color. You're welcome."

            "content": "Yeah, Mike brought up about what inning we're in. And I'd have to say we're not in the first inning and we're not in the ninth inning. So we challenge ourselves every day. What can we do to take more discretionary cost out of our system? Hey, the biggest thing that we did early on, and you kind of alluded to that is we took some of our high cost facilities out of the system. And on the West Coast, you have seen that quarter-over-quarter as we idled the Martinez refinery as an oil refinery. And through the subsequent quarters, we completed a majority of the idling costs. And, going forward, Doug, we just continue to look at efficiency cost savings every day, while maintaining our emphasis towards safe and reliable operations for our assets. Those are non-negotiable. Discretionary spending is negotiable. Sure, Mike. From a project standpoint, I'd like to give a little bit of color on where we stand from a timing schedule standpoint. At this point, Phase 1, we're targeting completion in the second half of next year 2022. And that would be for 17,000 barrels of renewable fuels coming online. And then, that would be followed up by pretreatment in 2023. And then, finally, the rest of the facility, the back half at 2023 for a total of 48,000 barrels for renewable diesel, renewable fuels production. Now, if I go back to Doug's comment or question before as far as OpEx, I commented that Martinez was a very high cost oil refinery. But there are some real gems at Martinez that make it a very good project for us from a renewable fuel standpoint, 300 processing units, 2 hydrogen plants, the infrastructure that provides us the ability to have a very cost competitive Brownfield project. And so, I can't give a lot more CapEx guidance. And you've already alluded to, but we're very excited about this project. And just what we've done in the last quarter in Q1, we progressed our engineering work toward the end of definition engineering, and have also made a lot of progress on our permitting efforts with regards to getting the environmental impact report kick-started and out for review in the near-term. Okay. I'll go ahead and take this question. This is Ray. You're right, Martinez is largely out of the OpEx number. There still is some residual OpEx for tank cleaning and work that we'll carry on to this year. So there is a little bit of Martinez spend. I will say on the West Coast, Q1, quarter one was a challenging OpEx quarter, primarily because the energy costs put a big demand on us in the last part of February and early March. I will say, on the West Coast, we were partially able to mitigate the impact of those natural gas price spike, by reducing our natural gas purchase requirements to close to balance by producing more internal fuel from our operations. I think this was a real key for us, as far as managing the winter storm, not just in Texas, but across all of our operations. And I really got to give a shout out to our commercial group. Close coordination with our commercial group and the refineries really allowed us to pivot quickly. And on the day one natural gas went up by 100 fold, and adjust our operations, reduce our demand requirement for natural gas, and have as minimal of an impact on our OpEx as possible. So, that was across all of our system. It really was impactful on the West Coast as well. Aside from that, I'll just go back to what I said earlier, as far as, every day we challenge ourselves, discretionary spending from got-to-do-stay-in-business type of spending. And that's starting to show in the numbers. Okay, this is Ray again, and I'll start off with the first thing as far as what we learn from startup. One of the things we learned, we already knew is that startups are hard. You don't just push a button and everything works perfectly. But I will tell you, in the first quarter, we achieved 90% of our design capacity at Dickinson. And we also qualified and got a provisional score for our renewable feedstocks, which is soybean oil and corn oil. And, that's a lower number than the temporary score that we start off with. But as you know, we're not seeking to get to 90%. We want to get to 100% of capacity and get lower carbon-intensity score. So work has continued in that regard. We work with our licensor for the process and catalyst on a new catalyst formulation. We just actually did that work and it's come back up. So we're working towards getting better, getting toward a 100% yield, and exactly what we want from the project. Yeah, let me take a shot at that. This is Ray. When I talked earlier about looking at the needs versus want. So, certainly the maintenance CapEx is along that line. So we challenge ourselves every day to the point of where we are, whether it's OpEx or CapEx, as far as really scrutinizing the spend. So, our goal is not to go grossly up on maintenance CapEx. Sure, this is Ray. The design basis for the project is 10,000 barrels a day of soybean oil, and 2000 barrels of corn oil, treated corn oil. So that's the goal. That's where we're headed to get as we get into the second quarter. Just a little bit about the CI value, the target CI value for soybean oil is going to be in the mid-50s. And take about 30 numbers off that for corn oil. So that's the range you need to be thinking about from a carbon intensity standpoint."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 8 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.20. Adjusted EBITDA was $1,552 million for the quarter. This includes results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital was $613 million, which is a nearly $500 million increase since the prior quarter. It's also marked the first time since the start of the pandemic that cash from continuing operations has been above our quarterly dividend payments, which was $379 million. Slide 9 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2020 to first quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $650 million more quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by higher earnings in refining and marketing. As a reminder, both the fourth and first quarter results reflect Speedway as a discontinued operation. Moving to our segment results, Slide 10 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment. The business reported positive EBITDA for the first time since the start of the COVID pandemic with first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $23 million. This was an increase of $725 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, which were considerably improved across all regions in the first quarter, as compared to the fourth quarter. Total utilization for refining was 83%, which was roughly flat with the fourth quarter utilization of 82%. Doug, I think Mike covered it quite comprehensively. Just a couple of other additions, as we continue to say it was our objective and continues to be to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet, as you've seen and Mike talked about. Fitch has already confirmed that. So another key variable that we will continue to consider, we want to be sure that the debt repayment is efficient. But other than that, I think Mike has covered the comments quite well. And that, so the only other thing I'd add is, we have committed, we've restated it many times that once we get too close, we'll provide some more details. We're getting really close. And hopefully that's not too far away from now. But we've been resistant to doing it ahead of time. So we're just \u2013 soon as we get close, we'll give a little more color to the market and then continue to communicate the way we have been, I think. It's Maryann, let me try to address your first question around the second quarter guidance and certainly as compared to the first quarter. Just maybe as a bit of a reminder, we are expecting volumes to be up slightly from the first quarter about 2.7 million barrels per day, as you spoke about the distribution costs 1.25 is the expectation for the second quarter again up slightly, we are expecting some higher product demand and therefore obviously some higher costs to transport product, but overall, fairly flattish if we look at the increase in the expectation for throughput. And then, similarly, when you look at total operating costs really on a per barrel basis, when you consider that there are about flattish Q1 to Q2. So, hope that helps to address your questions there around the nature of the second quarter guidance. Mike has cleared for you sort of how we're thinking about the second quarter, obviously, things can play out just depending on how the demand and recovery happens. But hopefully that addresses your question, Paul. Yeah, Paul, it's Maryann again. So you're right, when we talk about total operating costs based on that demand, it's about $5.20 versus the quarter, which was about $5.16. I was saying about flat, but you're right, that there is a slight kick-up as we think about those total operating costs. And then distribution costs, hopefully, I tried to address the key elements there that were drivers to the higher cost."

            "content": "Yeah. Hi, Roger. This is Rick Hessling. So the intel you're getting in Canada or from Canada is spot on, we're hearing the same thing. They've experienced some startup issues at a couple \u2013 with a couple of their maintenance projects, as well as we're hearing 1 of the producers specifically is having some COVID issues. So that's certainly not good for production in Canada. So we'll continue to watch that specifically to Canada. In terms of differentials in Canada, I would point you towards, I still think, probably, your general rule of thumb is the forward market there, which is plus or minus $12. And the incremental barrel in Canada is moving out via rail, the pipes are full, so we expect that to continue. When you look worldwide and more so on the Gulf Coast, a lot of \u2013 there's a lot of conversation around OPEC and the barrels that they're releasing into the market. I'm a little more measured on OPEC, and what we might expect on the Gulf Coast than others. Quite frankly, when you look at what OPEC has done in the last several months, they've been very measured on how they're managing their production with demand. And currently today, as you know, we've got a tug of war. There's a little bit of slight optimism coming out of the West. And then there's a lot of the fear of the unknown, which is well publicized in India, so we'll just have to see how that plays out."

[Operator instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. References to MPC\u2019s capital spending during the prepared remarks today reflects standalone MPC Capital excluding MPLX. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. First off, I want to recognize a new director on the MPC board. Toni Townes-Whitley will be joining our board in March, bringing tremendous experience with her most recent executive position at Microsoft, as well as her board experience on the NASDAQ and PNC boards. Also like to recognize Christine Breves, who was appointed as a new independent director of MPLX in November, and recently served as CFO for US Steel. As we look back at 2022, we've delivered on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was just over $16 billion on a consolidated basis, and over $13 billion, excluding MPLX, reflecting our improving operating and commercial execution. Our commitment to safe and reliable operations resulted in refining utilization of 96%. And our team's dynamic responses to volatile product markets delivered strong commercial performance, resulting in a 98% full year capture. Our focus on fostering a low-cost culture enable us to sustain our previously achieved $1.5 billion of structural cost reduction throughout the year. We formed a strategic partnership with Neste, which will enhance the economics of our Martinez Renewables fuels project and create a platform for additional collaboration within renewables. In Midstream, our business grew 7% year-over-year, MPLX raise its distribution by 10%. And based on this level, we expect MPC will receive $2 billion of annual distributions. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio. And as MPLX grows its free cash flow, we believe we will continue to have the capacity to increase its capital return to unit holders. In 2022, we return nearly $12 billion through share repurchases, bringing the total repurchases to almost $17 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC\u2019s dividend 30% to $0.75 per quarter. Executing on our operating, commercial and financial objectives, combined with a strong macroenvironment led to total shareholder returns of 87% for MPC in 2022. Before Maryann goes through the results for the quarter, we wanted to share our outlook on the macroenvironment and the financial priorities for 2023. Our outlook remains bullish for \u201823 supported by the nearly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity that has come offline globally in the last couple of years. Demand for transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust. We've seen recovery in demand across all our products since coming out of the pandemic. And we anticipate further recovery in 2023, particularly as we expect consumers to adjust consumption patterns to lower retail fuel prices. Uncertainties remain around the pace and impact of China's recovery, the magnitude of a potential US or global recession and the impact of Russian product sanctions. But despite these unknowns, we believe that the current supply constraints and growing demand will support strong refining margins in \u201823. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. These includes first sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate. Second, our dividend, we are committed to the dividend which we increased 30% at the end of last year, and intend to evaluate at least annually. And as we repurchase shares, the reduction in the share count increases the ability to support future dividend growth. Third, growth capital. We believe this is a return on and return of capital business. We've been through a progressive change over the last few years and remain focused on ensuring the competitiveness of our assets as we progress through the energy evolution. We will invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. In traditional refining, we're focused on investments that enhance the competitiveness of our assets. In the low carbon area, investment at this time is primarily associated with the completion of the Martinez Renewables project, as well as a project at our LA refinery that will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. In addition, we're focused on growth opportunities in emerging technologies, as well as opportunities enabled by digital transformation. Beyond these three objectives, we're also returning s excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. In the period from early November through the end of January, we've completed nearly $2.4 billion of share repurchases. And today, we announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization, reinforcing our commitment to strong capital returns. Our goal is to be the investment of choice in the refining space, generating the most through cycle cash flow, creating value through strategic deployment of capital and delivering superior returns to our shareholders. We also challenged ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce GHG emissions, methane emissions and freshwater intensity targets which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible path to accomplish. As we innovate for the future, Phase 1 of our Martinez Renewables fuel facilities progressing startup activities, marking a significant milestone in our sustainable energy goals. The facility is on track to reach full Phase 1 production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of the first quarter 2023. Pretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of \u201823, which will enable the facility to ramp up to its full expected capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. At Dickinson, we've optimized operations to be able to bringing in more advantage feedstocks, lowering the carbon intensity of the fuels we produce. We've enhanced our position in the renewables value chain through our pretreatment facilities in Beatrice and Cincinnati. We'll continue to look for opportunities leveraging the strategic partnerships we're cultivating with Neste and ADM. As evidence of our progress on our sustainability goals, this year, MTC was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the fourth consecutive year. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Moving the fourth quarter results. Slide 6 provides the summary of our financial results, this morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.65. This excludes a $176 million LIFO inventory benefit, as well as $60 million gain related to the Speedway transactions. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was $4.4 billion. During the quarter, we returned $351 million to shareholders through dividend payments, and repurchased over $1.8 billion of our shares. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing, as the blended crack spread was down over $5 per barrel, reflecting a 20% quarterly decline. Corporate expenses were higher in the fourth quarter driven by a retroactive operating tax assessments for prior periods. We intend to pursue recovery of these multiyear tax assessments. In addition, corporate includes special compensation expenses, which also affected our refining and marketing and midstream segments. We do not anticipate that these costs will structurally impact future corporate cost. The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of nearly $1 billion and the full year tax rate was 22%. Moving to our segment results, slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segments. Like many in the industry, several of our refineries were impacted by winter storm Elliott at the end of December, primarily in our Gulf Coast in Mid-Con regions. Most of our assets were back online after a short period, and we have not seen structural issues. The crude throughput impact was approximately 4 million barrels, which reduced our crude capacity utilization for the fourth quarter by roughly 2%. Looking to January, we anticipate impacts to throughput of 3.5 million barrels which is reflected in our guidance for the first quarter of 2023. Even with a disruption at the end of the quarter, our refining assets ran at 94% utilization, processing 2.7 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. Sequentially we saw per barrel margins decline most notably in the West Coast region, while US Gulf Coast margins were relatively flat, supported by export demand. Capture was 109% reflecting a strong result from our commercial team. Operating expenses were lower in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower energy cost partially offset by a special compensation expense of approximately $0.15 per barrel, paid in recognition for our employees contributions. Due to lower throughputs in the quarter refining operating costs per barrel were roughly flat in the fourth quarter at $5.62 per barrel as compared to the third quarter. Our full year refining operating costs per barrel is $5.41 when we compare to 2021 refining operating costs per barrel of $5.02, this increase can be entirely attributed to higher energy costs. We believe the actions we have taken to reduce our structural operating costs are sustainable. Slide 9 provides an overview of our refining and marketing capture this quarter, which was 109%. Our commercial teams executed effectively in a volatile market, light product margin tailwinds improved secondary product prices and favorable inventory impacts all benefited capture. We do not expect all of these tailwinds to be repeatable. And in particular, we would expect the inventory impacts to reverse in the first quarter. As our strategic pillar indicates we have been committed to improving our commercial performance and we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last 18 months will provide a sustainable advantage. Historically, we communicated a captured target of 95%. But over the last few years, the baseline has moved through our commercial efforts closer to 100%. We believe we have built capabilities that will provide incremental value beyond what we have realized to date, and will produce results that can be seen in our financials. Slide 10 show the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment delivered resilient fourth quarter results. We did see lower EBITDA, primarily due to impacts associated with lower NGL prices. This quarter MPLX distributions contributed $502 million in cash flow to MPC. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital was $4.4 billion in the quarter. Working Capital was a $72 million headwind for the quarter, driven mostly by declining crude prices offset by benefits from inventory impacts. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.3 billion this quarter. We saw consistent spending in refining in the fourth quarter as work progress on the Martinez Renewables fuel facility conversion and the STAR project at Galveston Bay. While not reflected in the 2022 capital spend, due to the timing of the JV close, the 50% reimbursement from Neste for Martinez capital spend, was received and reflected in overall cash flows in the third quarter. MPC returned nearly $2.2 billion via share repurchase and dividends during the quarter. We began using the incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization in November. For the full year, we returned $13.2 billion out of $17.7 billion of our 2022 cash from operations, excluding working capital impacts, representing a 75% payout. This was partially enabled by our commitment to complete our $15 billion capital return program. The outstanding purchase authorization of $7.6 billion, which includes the incremental $5 billion approval demonstrates our commitment to returning capital. At the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $11.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. Slide 12 provides their capital investment plan for 2023, which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC\u2019s investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.3 billion. The plan includes $1.25 billion for the refining and marketing segment, of which approximately $350 million or roughly 30% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance. Our growth capital plan is approximately $900 million split between low carbon and traditional projects. Within low carbon $150 million is allocated for completion of the Martinez conversion. We are also executing a project at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. This is a multiyear project. In 2023, we expect associated capital spending to be $150 million. And we have allocated $50 million to smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Within traditional refining, $150 million is associated with the completion of the STAR project. $200 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing the yields of our refineries, improving energy efficiency, and lowering our cost. In marketing, we plan to spend $150 million for projects that focus on enhancing and expanding the platform for our Marathon and ARCO brands. This morning MPLX also announced their 2023 capital investment plan of $950 million. Their plan includes approximately $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. The capital spending plan focuses on adding new gas processing plants and smaller investments targeted at expansion and debottlenecking. of existing assets to meet customer demand. Turning to guidance, slide 13, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.5 million barrels per day, representing 88% utilization. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due to turn around impacts in our US Gulf Coast region, plan turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $350 million in the first quarter, with a significant level of activity in the Gulf Coast region. The remaining scope of the STAR project, specifically 40,000 barrels per day of crude and 17,000 barrels per day of resid processing capacity is expected to be tied in during the turnaround at Galveston Bay in the first quarter, and should begin to ramp starting in the second quarter of 2023. We expect the level of 2023 turnaround spending to be similar to the level of spend in 2022. However, unlike 2022, we expect turnaround activity to be front half weighted this year, with significant planned work in the first and second quarters. Therefore, we will have executed four consecutive quarters of heavy turnaround work. Operating costs per barrel in the first quarter are expected to be flat at $5.60 per barrel for the quarter. In conjunction with our turnarounds, we anticipate higher project related expenses as we utilize our planned downtime to complete other work plans. We are seeing the benefits from lower energy costs in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions. But given the majority of our turnaround activity is heavily weighted to the Gulf Coast. Our expectations of flat operating costs quarter-to- quarter is driven by our West Coast exposure, where we have not seen a decline in energy costs recently. As we look into 2023, we anticipate our operating costs per barrel would decline and trend towards a more normalized level as we complete this turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks Maryann. In summary, we believe solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. Similar to what we've achieved with cost reductions and portfolio. We believe the improvements we've made to our commercial and operational execution have driven structural sustainable benefits, which will enable us to capture opportunities, irrespective of the market environment. Our goal is to position MPC as the refiner investment of choice, generating the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. [Operator Instructions] And with that, Sheila, we're ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, good morning team and congrats on strong results here. The first question I had was around the magnitude of capital returns. How should we think about the percentage of cash flow or free cash flow you target to get back to shareholders in a given year through buybacks and dividends? And then you talk about a $1 billion being the target level of cash. We've heard some of your peers talk about that number being higher, why is a $1 billion the right number and how long does it take to get there? Given how strong the environment is?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. Let me try to break that into a couple of parts there and then see if I can -- if I've done your question justice. So in first part really the cadence if you will of the share buyback and our return of capital, as you can see from the quarter, Neil, we did $1.8 billion in share repurchase and then we continue to buy back in the month of January. Just wanted to remind you we did complete our $15 billion share repurchase in early October and I indicated on the quarterly call that we would begin using that incremental $5 billion authorization in November. So essentially for the better part of October, our cadence, we worked in the market buying back in October, just to be clear. And then we did seek and have announced an incremental $5 billion authorization. So that leaves us with $7.6 billion of share buyback authorization, hopefully indicating our continued commitment to buyback. And we hope you see that. The second part of your question, just really think around our commitment there. I think that's what you were saying. So when do we get to that $1 billion? How long does it take us and why? We feel a $1 billion is an appropriate level of cash. First, because during the pandemic, we probably stress tested our liquidity and our cash position in one of the most challenging markets. Second, I'd say keep in mind that we receive a $2 billion distribution from MPLX, probably unique when you look at us compared to our peers. So, in reality, that's about $3 billion. And then you combine that with our liquidity, we feel pretty comfortable within a range of outcomes that $1 billion is appropriate. I hope that addresses your questions, Neil.\nMike Hennigan: Neil, it\u2019s Mike. Let me just add to what Maryann just said. So we had been at about $1.6 billion from MPLS, moved up to $1.8 billion, we're now at $2 billion pace, we expect that to continue to grow. If people listen to the MPLX call, we're in a real good position there. But that distribution, let's say at the $2 billion pace, that essentially covers the dividend, and half of the refining capital commitment for refining. So that's part of the reason that we are comfortable with $1 billion on the balance sheet. Now, as you pointed out, we still finished the year with close to $12 billion on the balance sheet. So we still have a lot of financial capability to get to a new normal at some point, but hopefully that helps explain why the $1 billion is the right number. And it has to do with our affiliation with MPLX.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, good problems, Mike. And then the follow up is around the STAR project, remind us economics, it seems like it's coming on at a good time. But how should we think about what this project could mean for incremental cash flow? And in both a midcycle environment, but also, its current spot economics?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Neil, thanks for that question. It's one we've been getting from a lot of people. So it's relatively easy to model. So up until now, the parts of STAR that are in place are in our results. What's not in our results, is 40,000 barrels a day of crude capacity. And the easiest way to model is take that number times the differential between heavy crude, and ULSD. So if you look at that differential, and you multiply it by 40,000 barrels a day, that's the additional EBITDA that we'll get once STAR is online. But STAR is a pretty unique project for us. So I'm going to ask Tim to make a couple of comments on it. So you have the financial side of it, but let me give you a little bit of the background behind it with Tim some details, please.\nTim Aydt : Okay. Thanks Mike. So Neil, is good question that you have there. So let me give you a little backdrop, keep in mind that we've done this project in phases, a fair amount of the STAR scope has already been completed and put in service, so it's already earning a return, the remaining work that we have is really going to be completed with this planned turnaround that ends late in the first quarter, and then we'll be starting up the units in April. So we do expect STAR\u2019s EBITDA contribution to continue to ramp after startup in April and through the second quarter. The remaining scope is really going to be one like Mike just indicated, is going to increase crude capacity by 40,000 a day, and also the resid upgrading capacity by 17,000 a day. So maybe a little background on that decision rather than expanded the Galveston Bay cokers, we elected to upgrade the resilient hydrocracker unit because it offers better conversion and increased liquid volume yield. So it was a better choice than the coker. The fractionation modifications that we made are also going to increase the diesel recovery, which is profitable. And then the refinery will also be able to process a significantly more of the discounted heavy Canadian crude. So those are some of the reasons that drove us to that. So we feel really good about the economic drivers of the project. And with the current heavy crude discounts and the strong diesel margins, the near-term economics are better than when we sanction the project. So hopefully that's helpful.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Someone didn't pay the phone bill, guys. I'm so sorry about that. So how is everybody doing? Thanks. I apologize for that. So I, well I was \u2013 half of my questions got asked, but let me give it a go. I guess Mike, first of all, when I look at the earnings part of the business, and I look at where your share price is trading. And obviously you gave us a dividend back in November. How are you thinking about you reloaded the buyback program? How are you thinking about the balance between dividends and share buybacks? And you know where I'm going with this? Because obviously, your dividend is fully covered by your distributions from MPLX. So in this kind of environment, should we be buying back a lot of stock at this level? Or should we be thinking that the dividend is a bit more of a bias in 2023?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey, Doug, it\u2019s Maryann. I'll pass it back to Mike here in a second. But as we talked about the dividend, we committed to looking at that dividend annually. We wanted to be sure that it was secure. We wanted to be competitive with the potential to grow. And we will continue to look at that. As we've shared in the past, and obviously, as you stated, we have increased the outstanding authorization to $7.6 billion of share repurchase, we continue to think that share repurchase over dividend is an appropriate return of capital. You'll see us continuing to use that authorization as we did here in the last quarter. So, yes, we'll evaluate that dividend but we continue to see share repurchase as a bit more preferential over the dividend. I'll pass it to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Doug, I'll just add to what Maryann said, obviously, we want to have a competitive dividend and a growing dividend over time. So that is foundational to us. It is a little bit tax inefficient relative to share buybacks. That's why Maryann just said that we leaned a little more that way. And the sheer magnitude of the financial capacity we have right now with finishing the year with about $12 billion of cash on the balance sheet and continuing to have a strong refining environment, just the sheer magnitude is much more towards that side of the return of capital. So we're going to look at it, we've committed that we'll look at it each year, and we want to be committed to it. At the end of the day, obviously, a lot of our attention just because of the magnitude of the number is directed towards the repurchase program.\nDoug Leggate: Okay, I understand, I guess no one is going to complain about the yield, given that your share price is a big part of that. So but I appreciate the answer. My follow up is an operational question, Mike, I think it's pretty well known that you guys had a fair amount of maintenance in the quarter. But the capture rate was still quite strong, at least on our numbers. And I am looking at the product sales relative to the refinery throughput and wondering if that was part of what was going on there. So I'm wondering if you could help us understand the strength of the operating performance, and maybe give us a steer as to how you see your full year \u201823 downtime average because we're hearing from a lot of your peers that \u201823 is going to be a big year for the whole industry. And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Doug. It's a good question. So I'm going to pass it to Maryann in a second. But when we started this out a couple of years ago, we said there's three areas that we're going to concentrate heavily on, one of them was improving our commercial performance. So let Maryann give a little more color on that.\nMaryann Mannen: Sure. Thanks, Doug. As Mike indicated, our strategic pillars remained foundational, and our commercial performance is clearly one that we remain committed to, you may remember in the last set of guidance, we said that we thought our capture could actually be impacted, given what was a higher turnaround, frankly, they are highest one in 2022. But the commercial team did take quite a bit of initiative in the quarter. I'll give you some highlights and then pass it to Brian and Rick, but one of the things that we saw at 109% capture in this quarter, we had strong light product margins, we had favorable inventory impacts. And then also favorable pricing of secondaries. We we don't think necessarily all of these tailwinds would repeat, and certainly depending on where we sell pricing, some of them could actually be a headwind, particularly when we look at our secondary products. And historically, we've talked about a 95% capture rate over the last few years, given the work that the commercial team has been doing. We're moving more toward 100%. So we're going to continue to challenge ourselves to deliver that. And with that, I'll maybe ask Brian and Rick to give you some incremental color on the specifics there.\nRick Hessling: Hey, Doug. It's just a few add-ons to Maryann's comments. So the 98% in 2022, is it sustainable? What I would say to that is, is there will be a lot of volatility, and it'll ebb-and-flow. But this is not a one-time event, we have meaningfully changed the way we go to market from a commercial perspective throughout our entire company. And the focus that we've had since Mike has taken the helm and put in the new leadership team has been night and day and will continue to be. So when you look at 2023 and beyond, I would say you should expect continued momentum, expect volatility, but expect results that will continue to outpace many of our peers.\nDoug Leggate: Honestly, guys, I think that has been overlooked. Sorry, please go ahead.\nBrian Partee: Yes, Doug, this is Brian, I was just going to bolt-on, real quickly to Rick's comments that we really have the team relentlessly pursuing value capture. We've got the team consolidated into really one functional team across the entire value chain, which historically was divided up into multiple silos. And that's been a key differentiation point for us. We're also very adamant about serving our customers. So my team has an example on the clean product side of things. So as we think about turnaround activity and impact to capture, we've got to operate in an environment where whether it's an unplanned outage or planned outage, we've got to serve our customers. So there's a lot of things that we can do from a turnaround planning perspective to build and advance the turnaround to build different feedstocks, depending on the units that are down. And ultimately, we've got the logistics firepower to purchase to cover as well. So I think that's what you're seeing in the numbers as you called out the churn activity relative to sales. We've got the right capabilities to purchase the cover, if we've got refining down either planned or unplanned.\nDoug Leggate: Guys, I think it is going to surprise a lot of people. I really appreciate the full answer. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes, good morning, everybody. Yes, another, certainly, I'll give you congrats on the capture there. Well done everything. Maybe to change pace though a little bit. I'd like to ask about the process in Martinez, and how we should think about the upcoming timeline and any particular milestones we should be watching for, and maybe how you think about it contributing at a cash flow basis, whether that's happens meaningfully in \u201823 or we should wait till \u201824.\nTim Aydt : Hello, Roger, this is Tim, I'll take that one. I guess first on the schedule, we spent really the most the part of January, conducting startup and commissioning activities. And we put fresh feed and actually yesterday in the HDO unit. And we expect finished product the storage here next week. So we are on track to reach full phase production capacity, which is 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of this first quarter here. You may know that we're also what we refer to as Phase 2 is constructing some pretreatment capabilities. And those are scheduled to come online in the second half of 2023. And then the facility is expected to be capable of producing the full capacity, which is 730 million gallons per year, by the end of 2023. So we're on track and feeling good.\nMike Hennigan: Roger, it\u2019s Mike. The only thing that I would add is we feel really good about the project. And the team's execution has been good. But in light of where the refining macro is today it's not the contributor that it would be saying it when we get back to midcycle at some point, it's going to be a meaningful contributor, but obviously, it's dwarfed by what's happening in refining today.\nRoger Read: Yes, refining is certainly strong, but that kind of gives me my other follow up question is we've obviously seen some good things in terms of pickup in jet demand, gasoline has continued to look a little soft, I just wonder if he could give us an overview. I guess basically, across your system, how you see things.\nBrian Partee: Roger, this is Brian. So I'll start in just a little bit of reflection on 2022. Because I think we've as an industry really domestically here in the US exited at a point of inflection as relates to COVID recovery. So globally, really strong year in 2022, when you look at a year-on-year 2.3 million barrels a day of overall oil demand increase, as Mike mentioned, in his prepared remarks, we expect to see continued increases into 2023 and beyond. Domestically from what we're seeing, and this is a bit of a triangulation, I know, there's a lot of dialogue around individual marketing books, EIA, data, mobility data. So you have to be a little bit of a statistician and try to piece it all together to formulate an informed view around actual demand. But from an overall perspective, backing through the back end of COVID, diesel has been resilient throughout. It remains resilient domestically here in the US, gasoline if you remember when we went into COVID, early on a lot of conversations around structural impacts. And we do feel like we've seen some structural implications as a result of COVID. But most of that's been on the gasoline front. And we're kind of at a point now where our call of post COVID demand is off about 3% on the gasoline front from 2019 levels. That's probably pretty sticky. The headwind, there is obviously the work from home a little bit of tailwind. We've seen some decreased use in public transportation offsetting that, but 3% is been about the number that we've seen consistently as we look across our books. And then as it relates to jet, steady rate double recovery as what we've seen the last couple of years, we expect to see full recovery domestically here, as we progress through 2023. So back half of 2023 seeing full recovery. As relates to our book, maybe I'll just kind of wrap it up there. What we found in Q4, gasoline year-on-year, 2%. The bright spot of interest was the West Coast. So we actually saw a 5% increase year-on-year in the fourth quarter in the West Coast. Diesel was up 4% and jet was up 3% on year-to-year basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Hi, guys. Good morning. Few questions, if I could. The first one is really simple. Fourth quarter, I think Maryann mentioned that as some favorable inventory benefits. I assume, Maryann, you were referring outside the LIFO impact which you take it as a special item or that's what you refer. If this is not then can you give us some idea, then how big is that number in the fourth quarter? And secondly, I think you guys talking about a continuing investment, that this year $150 million in the LA refinery system? If I didn't get it wrong. Can you maybe give us some idea that what all investment we're talking about? And what all of benefits we could expect from there, is there any changing in terms of the crews lay or energy usage or that product yield? Anything that you could share on that? Thank you.\nMaryann Mannen: Hey, Paul, it's Maryann. So you're absolutely correct. The inventory benefits that I was discussing, when talking about the capture rate we achieved in the quarter are outside the LIFO benefits. As you've seen, we've excluded the LIFO benefit from our adjusted results. So I'm talking about commercial performances, obviously, winter storm has impacts on us. And the ability for our teams to address the inventory issues is really what I was referring to when we talk about capturing the quarter not LIFO.\nPaul Cheng: Yes, Maryann, can you quantify how roughly -- how big is that benefit in the fourth quarter?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes, Paul, we've not provided that level of detail on each of those individual contributors, inventory, a piece of that, again, I mentioned strong light product margins in the quarter. We saw the benefit of pricing happen on the secondaries. So there were several contributors to the upsides performance, but we typically don't provide that granular detail on this significance of each one of those.\nTim Aydt : Okay. This is Tim, I'll take your second question. Relative to the LAR project that we were referring to in the opening remarks, that's really a project that addresses the next phase of an upcoming regulation that is going to be mandating further NOx reductions. And that's regulation is going to apply to all of the refineries in the LA basin, not just ours, of course. And so there's going to be some significant investment required by the industry in order to comply with this. And we believe we have a very unique opportunity at our Los Angeles refining complex to really modernize our utility systems at both Carson and Wilmington facilities in order to meet this Phase 1 and Phase 2 of these reduction requirements. So that's what's driving it. And I think the other thing that's worth noting is this novel project really goes beyond NOx reductions for us. And it will also reduce our SO2, our particulate matter, or VOCs, and some greenhouse gases. So besides lowering our facility emissions, it's also going to improve our reliability. And it's going to reduce our energy usage, which will significantly lower our operating cost. These cost reductions will come in the form of energy efficiency and lower maintenance spend. And the thing we like about it is that these favorable economics are independent of the light product margin fluctuations that can occur. So this was kind of all around the backdrop of the LA refinery is certainly a core asset for us on the West Coast. And it's part of the value chain. And it's already one of the most competitive refineries in the state. So this project is going to further cement its competitive position in California, which is consistent with our strategic initiative of being the most cost-effective refiner in every market we serve. So we expect the project to be completed in 2025. And in time to meet the initial compliance dates for the new regulation. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nPaul Cheng: Yes, what's the total investment? That $150 million for this year, should we assume $150 million again in 2025. And in terms of the lower energy costs, better efficiency on there? Is there any number you could share to try to quantify what is that benefits?\nTim Aydt : Unfortunately, we generally don't get into those specific numbers on individual projects and returns but it's significant in the sense that it's lowering our emissions and providing a payback.\nPaul Cheng: $1 billion CapEx, is it $150 million a year?\nMike Hennigan: Hey, Paul, it's Mike, we haven't disclosed the multiyear, we will give more color on that as time goes on. What Tim was trying to say is, it is a multiyear project, and we're going to start off with it. It'll be $150 million this year, and we'll give more color as time goes by.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Hye, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So just to stick with project growth, and looking at your CapEx budget, and your growth program was about $900 million. That number, I assume will be going down close to Martinez and STAR. So looking into the future, where do you think growth capital goes from here? I think we could structurally lower growth CapEx in 2024 plus, or is there maybe another phase of project we'll start hearing about going forward? And I know you've spoken about the LA project, but just wondering beyond that.\nMike Hennigan: John, it's Mike, I\u2019ll start off. We've broken it into two buckets, traditional refining and low carbon. And it's our expectation that low carbon bucket will continue to grow over time and at the same time, though, we do have a bunch of projects Tim just mentioned one that will really improve the competitiveness of LA, we have a bunch of those still, that we think we can implement on the traditional refining side as well. So I think you're going to see a nice blend on both sides of the business there over time. I don't think you should expect that number to be going meaningfully down. Yes, I know, people have talked a lot about STAR but we have enough projects that we think are attractive returns, we just want to implement them over time and be disciplined on the way that we allocate capital, but I think you're going to see both buckets and not have an expectation they're going down, because we still think there's a decent amount of return on capital opportunities for us in light of what's been a major return of capital recently from us.\nJohn Royall: Great. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just talk about how you're thinking about the Russia product sanctions that are going to be hitting here on the certain? And how that maybe -- how that may trickle through the market? And how long do you think it will take for supply chains to adjust? And then relatedly, if you could just remind us the breakdown of Marathon\u2019s export destinations? How much goes to Latin America? How much goes to Europe? And do you expect to increase your exports to Europe after the fifth?\nBrian Partee: Yes, John, this is Brian, I'll take that. So just really quick on your question on timeline, we do not expect it to really unfold until the second quarter. So leading into the sanctions, as you'd expect, we saw a pretty meaningful de-inventorying coming out of Russia getting out of the sanctions, coupled with a re-inventorying in large parts of Northwest Europe. So as a result, we're entering the sanction period of time at really historically high levels of inventory, particularly in Europe. So we view it as 2Q and beyond timeline perspective, but directionally, we see it as bullish for cracks. We see 800 million to 1 million barrels a day of I'll call them structural historical imports into Northwest Europe coming out of Russia, those are going to have to be displaced. And we do expect a high degree of friction on those barrels, for variety of reasons. Product spec mix, is going to be difficult to place them in other markets. So as you'd expect, you have various regional specifications that need to be met local fuel standards that's going to propose some headwinds. The global tanker fleet is really pretty active and overburdened right now with differing trade flows on the crude front. And this is going to create another degree of inefficiency on a tanker, global tanker fleet capacity that we think will provide a degree of friction. And the last thing I'd mentioned, unlike crude on the product side, these are generally going to either countries or end consumers that really rely on receipt of the product. So supply assurance is a new variable that's really important here as well, that is we're hearing from our customers every day, that's a really important thing for them. I think, given the dynamic nature of the situation in Russia, that supply assurance component is really a big unknown, but we feel well, very well positions to take advantage of that, given our position in the Atlantic basin, as you probably know, we opened an office over in London late last year, and are very active in that market. The last point of your question in terms of distribution, without giving too much granular detail, a large portion of them historically have moved into Latin America. We've historically exported 250,000 to 350,000 barrels a day, depending around turnaround and unplanned downtime activity within our system, we do see an incremental pull into Europe, we've seen that we've got some actually really good fit for our Garyville distillate stream because we don't make jet out of our Garyville facility. It fits well into Northwest Europe, especially this time of the year. And we've seen exports into Northwest Europe late last year and the 120,000 barrels a day for the US into Europe. And we've done a meaningful part of that. And we expect to be meaningful part of that going forward.\nRick Hessling: Hey, John, this is Rick, just add on to Brian's comments. So a couple of points to further drive home how we feel about this market going forward. If you look at winter storm, Elliott in December, when it hit the immediate impact, it had on cracks. And it is again taken our life product inventories, especially here in the US down to levels that are five-year type low numbers, when you compound diesel inventories with VGO and the potential impact that the EU ban on Russian exports will have this could just further exasperate cracks to the positive. So more to watch on this. See how it plays out. I think Mike said earlier, it's neutral to positive. We're viewing it as a positive, especially if the cutbacks and sanctions take hold like most people think they will.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. I'm actually, I'm tempted to ask about commercial and turnaround integration again, because I do think that's probably the most important thing from this call. But I think people got the picture there. Instead of asking about low carbon growth, and specifically SAF. And I'm asking because investors ask about it a lot, because airlines talk about it frequently. And both of your partners in the renewable fuels category are also sort of publicly, very pro SAF. And so it'd be great to get your thoughts on that category. And see if you think there's any opportunity there. Thank you.\nDavid Heppner: Thanks, Sam. Hey, this was Dave, let me step back a little bit and touch on first that one of our strategic growth pillars for the company is around maximizing the value of our renewable liquid fuels. And so while promptly, a lot of that has been focused on renewable diesel with our Dickinson and Martinez, and the pretreat facilities around those as we look forward that's inclusive of Sustainable Aviation Fuel or SAF. So when you're thinking about growth, it is also inclusive SAF. And so second thing I want to maybe touch on is that we are a very large supplier of fossil fuel, jet fuel today. And our goal is to supply the products that our customers want, and need going forward. So as they, as you stated, there's a lot of chatter around SAF, we're there to help meet that and why you're hearing a lot of the chatter through the airline industries is because SAF is the most viable near term, decarbonization tools for that space. So as we look forward, we are very active in that. The challenge is the premium required, as you look at the SAF whether it be a conversion of a Dickinson or Martinez produce SAF or new investment, these are multiyear very large capital projects. Having confidence in that premium to justify that investment is where that little opportunities exist today. So we are very active just as we were in RD and the evaluation, the studies of where to participate in SAF and I think you see a lot of it within MPC, but also within our subsidiary company Virent. They take sugars into sustainable aviation fuel, you've seen announcements with them on test flights with United, most recently won with the Emirates along with our JV partner Neste. So you can see We're very active in the space of evaluating it, studying it, monitoring it and determining when is the right time to invest.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: Hi there. I just had a follow up question related to the Russia discussion, and specifically related to VGO and with the Russian\u2019s VGO exports to Europe dissipating from market and lack of clarity where incremental VGO is going to come from and understand that could help definitely in cracks all else equal, but how should we think about how it impacts your capture and what your net VGO position is long or short and how it trickles through your system?\nRick Hessling: Yes, Theresa, this is Rick. So we're short VGO, we're out in the market, especially now more than ever, when it\u2019s turnaround season and I will tell you the way we view this is this short and VGO is going to high grade up all capture specifically on Jet, diesel and light products. So we believe will be a recipient of it and that'll show through via the cracks going forward. Specifically, I will tell you as these Middle Eastern refineries come online midsummer, Theresa, they will domestically consume VGO which, in turn will further short the market, which we believe to be a nice shot in the arm, kind of mid-year end year. So more to come on that. Just something to keep your eye on.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you. And I also had a follow up question related to my comments about consumers potentially adjusting consumption patterns to lower retail fuel prices. Just curious what your views on elasticity is or are at this point. How does that reconcile with Brian's comments about gasoline and potentially structurally being off about 3%?\nRick Hessling: Yes, Theresa, it\u2019s a great question. It's one that we look at and try to draw the right corollary too but we do see a degree of flexibility there. Of course, it depends on the market, depends on the extent of the retail prices. We have seen and I commented on the West Coast in my comments earlier, in what I didn't mention, but we got under $5 a gallon on the West Coast in Q4. So that's where we saw my view is we saw nice demand recovery as relates to retail prices. But our forward view is definitely instructed by a moderated view on retail pricing, which we do think will impact demand somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% depending on the market, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% - 3%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Yes, good morning. How's it going? I don't think you guys discussed the outlook maybe I missed it, the outlook for light heavy crude quality dips. Clearly, they've been very supportive in the past couple quarters to earnings. And I think many in the market, expect those to come in as refiners consume. The SPR releases, new capacity comes online. OPAC exports have fallen off a bit. Can you just discuss how you expect those differentials to trend throughout the year? Thanks.\nRick Hessling: Yes. Hi, Jason. It's Rick. Very good question. So it's kind of a tail of two ends. I'll start with the front end here. Because as you look with what happened with the Keystone Pipeline outage, that back then barrels into Canada, Canadian inventories are high. We've had a lot of turnarounds in the US Gulf Coast. We've had winter storm Elliot back in barrels. So when you kind of add all of these together, along with a few of -- a few folks in the in the Mid-Con specifically pad two having issues. We are seeing really robust spreads right now. And we continue to see that to hang on for a bit. As the year plays out, and things get back to normal. I would say you could see some fall off to the spread, but we're still quite optimistic that it's going to be a better spread than midcycle as we look at the year in total.\nJason Gabelman: Great, that's helpful and just my follow up. I appreciate the comments on the Martinez project. And operationally, it sounds like everything's going well there. I was wondering from an earnings perspective, how much you expect that project to contribute in 2023, just given the pretreatment unit won't start up until later in the year. And at the numbers we look at, it seems like margins for projects that don't have pretreatments are much more challenged than projects that do. So if you just talk about the earnings in 2023, and the potential step up from the project once that operation units online.\nBrian Partee: Yes, this is Brian, Jason, I just maybe a reminder that we do have pretreatment capacity, not on site but off site. So both at Beatrice and Cincinnati facility, we've got substantial pretreatment capability there. So just kind of a reminder there, and I'll refer it regarding the overall EBITDA or our economic outlook to Mike and Maryann.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Jason, we don't give specific individual facility earnings profiles. I know it's a question and people have been trying to get their arms around. But the best guidance I can give you is if you look at the macroenvironment around the California market, and where each of the subsidies are trading, the key to remember because people ask us about LCFS. But there are other components to subsidy out there that all kind of worked together. And the three of them together have been relatively consistent, even though a lot of them are moving around a little bit. So that should help you a little bit as you model it. And then obviously, look at where feedstocks are trading and diesel's trading.\nMaryann Mannen: The other incremental comment that I would add to Mike's also is remember when we completed the JV with Neste, one of the things that we were looking for was incremental improvement around our feedstock slate, and we got that with a partner in Neste. So even though we are sharing 50% of the project, we actually improve the economics of the project by the feedstock that Neste is obligated to bring through their partnership with us. So just another data point as you're contemplating how to think about that.\nOperator: Our next question, and our last question will come from Matthew Blair with TPH.\nMatthew Blair: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Could I get your thoughts on the wide octane spreads that we've been seeing? What -- do you think that'll persist for the rest of 2023? And are you fully compliant on Tier 3? Or are you short and buying credits in the market? Thanks.\nRick Hessling: Yes, Matt, I can comment on the octane, they obviously you're going to move seasonally and quite a bit. But we've seen steady strength in octane spreads, really as a result of running the systems harder. As we look at not just our system, but the global system working to meet demands, and out running our octane capacity to a certain extent as other facilities have been shut down throughout the network. So you kind of have a bullish long-term outlook as it relates to octane spreads and position well around that, based on our octane capacity in our system.\nBrian Partee: And to the last part, we're not going to comment on our long or short position on the credits.\nKristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you, everyone for your interest in Marathon. If you have any additional questions or if you'd like clarification on the topics discussed this morning, please reach out and our IR team will be available to your call. I look forward to speaking with everyone. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Tim Aydt",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks Mike. So Neil, is good question that you have there. So let me give you a little backdrop, keep in mind that we've done this project in phases, a fair amount of the STAR scope has already been completed and put in service, so it's already earning a return, the remaining work that we have is really going to be completed with this planned turnaround that ends late in the first quarter, and then we'll be starting up the units in April. So we do expect STAR's EBITDA contribution to continue to ramp after startup in April and through the second quarter. The remaining scope is really going to be one like Mike just indicated, is going to increase crude capacity by 40,000 a day, and also the resid upgrading capacity by 17,000 a day. So maybe a little background on that decision rather than expanded the Galveston Bay cokers, we elected to upgrade the resilient hydrocracker unit because it offers better conversion and increased liquid volume yield. So it was a better choice than the coker. The fractionation modifications that we made are also going to increase the diesel recovery, which is profitable. And then the refinery will also be able to process a significantly more of the discounted heavy Canadian crude. So those are some of the reasons that drove us to that. So we feel really good about the economic drivers of the project. And with the current heavy crude discounts and the strong diesel margins, the near-term economics are better than when we sanction the project. So hopefully that's helpful. Hello, Roger, this is Tim, I'll take that one. I guess first on the schedule, we spent really the most the part of January, conducting startup and commissioning activities. And we put fresh feed and actually yesterday in the HDO unit. And we expect finished product the storage here next week. So we are on track to reach full phase production capacity, which is 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of this first quarter here. You may know that we're also what we refer to as Phase 2 is constructing some pretreatment capabilities. And those are scheduled to come online in the second half of 2023.

Because I think we've as an industry really domestically here in the US exited at a point of inflection as relates to COVID recovery. So globally, really strong year in 2022, when you look at a year-on-year 2.3 million barrels a day of overall oil demand increase, as Mike mentioned, in his prepared remarks, we expect to see continued increases into 2023 and beyond. Domestically from what we're seeing, and this is a bit of a triangulation, I know, there's a lot of dialogue around individual marketing books, EIA, data, mobility data.

The bright spot of interest was the West Coast. So we actually saw a 5% increase year-on-year in the fourth quarter in the West Coast. Diesel was up 4% and jet was up 3% on year-to-year basis. Yes, John, this is Brian, I'll take that. So just really quick on your question on timeline, we do not expect it to really unfold until the second quarter. So leading into the sanctions, as you'd expect, we saw a pretty meaningful de-inventorying coming out of Russia getting out of the sanctions, coupled with a re-inventorying in large parts of Northwest Europe. So as a result, we're entering the sanction period of time at really historically high levels of inventory, particularly in Europe. So we view it as 2Q and beyond timeline perspective, but directionally, we see it as bullish for cracks. We see 800 million to 1 million barrels a day of I'll call them structural historical imports into Northwest Europe coming out of Russia, those are going to have to be displaced. And we do expect a high degree of friction on those barrels, for variety of reasons. Product spec mix, is going to be difficult to place them in other markets. So as you'd expect, you have various regional specifications that need to be met local fuel standards that's going to propose some headwinds. The global tanker fleet is really pretty active and overburdened right now with differing trade flows on the crude front. And this is going to create another degree of inefficiency on a tanker, global tanker fleet capacity that we think will provide a degree of friction. And the last thing I'd mentioned, unlike crude on the product side, these are generally going to either countries or end consumers that really rely on receipt of the product. So supply assurance is a new variable that's really important here as well, that is we're hearing from our customers every day, that's a really important thing for them. I think, given the dynamic nature of the situation in Russia, that supply assurance component is really a big unknown, but we feel well, very well positions to take advantage of that, given our position in the Atlantic basin, as you probably know, we opened an office over in London late last year, and are very active in that market. The last point of your question in terms of distribution, without giving too much granular detail, a large portion of them historically have moved into Latin America. We've historically exported 250,000 to 350,000 barrels a day, depending around turnaround and unplanned downtime activity within our system, we do see an incremental pull into Europe, we've seen that we've got some actually really good fit for our Garyville distillate stream because we don't make jet out of our Garyville facility. It fits well into Northwest Europe, especially this time of the year. And we've seen exports into Northwest Europe late last year and the 120,000 barrels a day for the US into Europe. And we've done a meaningful part of that. And we expect to be meaningful part of that going forward. Yes, this is Brian, Jason, I just maybe a reminder that we do have pretreatment capacity, not on site but off site. So both at Beatrice and Cincinnati facility, we've got substantial pretreatment capability there. So just kind of a reminder there, and I'll refer it regarding the overall EBITDA or our economic outlook to Mike and Maryann. And to the last part, we're not going to comment on our long or short position on the credits."

            "name": "David Heppner",
            "content": "Thanks, Sam. Hey, this was Dave, let me step back a little bit and touch on first that one of our strategic growth pillars for the company is around maximizing the value of our renewable liquid fuels. And so while promptly, a lot of that has been focused on renewable diesel with our Dickinson and Martinez, and the pretreat facilities around those as we look forward that's inclusive of Sustainable Aviation Fuel or SAF. So when you're thinking about growth, it is also inclusive SAF. And so second thing I want to maybe touch on is that we are a very large supplier of fossil fuel, jet fuel today. And our goal is to supply the products that our customers want, and need going forward. So as they, as you stated, there's a lot of chatter around SAF, we're there to help meet that and why you're hearing a lot of the chatter through the airline industries is because SAF is the most viable near term, decarbonization tools for that space. So as we look forward, we are very active in that. The challenge is the premium required, as you look at the SAF whether it be a conversion of a Dickinson or Martinez produce SAF or new investment, these are multiyear very large capital projects. Having confidence in that premium to justify that investment is where that little opportunities exist today. So we are very active just as we were in RD and the evaluation, the studies of where to participate in SAF and I think you see a lot of it within MPC, but also within our subsidiary company Virent. They take sugars into sustainable aviation fuel, you've seen announcements with them on test flights with United, most recently won with the Emirates along with our JV partner Neste. So you can see We're very active in the space of evaluating it, studying it, monitoring it and determining when is the right time to invest."

            "name": "Rick Hessling",
            "content": "Hey, Doug. It's just a few add-ons to Maryann's comments. So the 98% in 2022, is it sustainable? What I would say to that is, is there will be a lot of volatility, and it'll ebb-and-flow. But this is not a one-time event, we have meaningfully changed the way we go to market from a commercial perspective throughout our entire company. And the focus that we've had since Mike has taken the helm and put in the new leadership team has been night and day and will continue to be. So when you look at 2023 and beyond, I would say you should expect continued momentum, expect volatility, but expect results that will continue to outpace many of our peers. Hey, John, this is Rick, just add on to Brian's comments. So a couple of points to further drive home how we feel about this market going forward. If you look at winter storm, Elliott in December, when it hit the immediate impact, it had on cracks. And it is again taken our life product inventories, especially here in the US down to levels that are five-year type low numbers, when you compound diesel inventories with VGO and the potential impact that the EU ban on Russian exports will have this could just further exasperate cracks to the positive. So more to watch on this. See how it plays out. I think Mike said earlier, it's neutral to positive. We're viewing it as a positive, especially if the cutbacks and sanctions take hold like most people think they will. Yes, Theresa, this is Rick. So we're short VGO, we're out in the market, especially now more than ever, when it's turnaround season and I will tell you the way we view this is this short and VGO is going to high grade up all capture specifically on Jet, diesel and light products. So we believe will be a recipient of it and that'll show through via the cracks going forward. Specifically, I will tell you as these Middle Eastern refineries come online midsummer, Theresa, they will domestically consume VGO which, in turn will further short the market, which we believe to be a nice shot in the arm, kind of mid-year end year. So more to come on that. Just something to keep your eye on. Yes, Theresa, it's a great question. It's one that we look at and try to draw the right corollary too but we do see a degree of flexibility there. Of course, it depends on the market, depends on the extent of the retail prices. We have seen and I commented on the West Coast in my comments earlier, in what I didn't mention, but we got under $5 a gallon on the West Coast in Q4. So that's where we saw my view is we saw nice demand recovery as relates to retail prices. But our forward view is definitely instructed by a moderated view on retail pricing, which we do think will impact demand somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% depending on the market, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% - 3%. Yes. Hi, Jason. It's Rick. Very good question. So it's kind of a tail of two ends. I'll start with the front end here. Because as you look with what happened with the Keystone Pipeline outage, that back then barrels into Canada, Canadian inventories are high. We've had a lot of turnarounds in the US Gulf Coast. We've had winter storm Elliot back in barrels. So when you kind of add all of these together, along with a few of -- a few folks in the in the Mid-Con specifically pad two having issues. We are seeing really robust spreads right now. And we continue to see that to hang on for a bit. As the year plays out, and things get back to normal. I would say you could see some fall off to the spread, but we're still quite optimistic that it's going to be a better spread than midcycle as we look at the year in total. Yes, Matt, I can comment on the octane, they obviously you're going to move seasonally and quite a bit. But we've seen steady strength in octane spreads, really as a result of running the systems harder. As we look at not just our system, but the global system working to meet demands, and out running our octane capacity to a certain extent as other facilities have been shut down throughout the network. So you kind of have a bullish long-term outlook as it relates to octane spreads and position well around that, based on our octane capacity in our system."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Moving the fourth quarter results. Slide 6 provides the summary of our financial results, this morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.65. This excludes a $176 million LIFO inventory benefit, as well as $60 million gain related to the Speedway transactions. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was $4.4 billion. During the quarter, we returned $351 million to shareholders through dividend payments, and repurchased over $1.8 billion of our shares. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing, as the blended crack spread was down over $5 per barrel, reflecting a 20% quarterly decline. Corporate expenses were higher in the fourth quarter driven by a retroactive operating tax assessments for prior periods. We intend to pursue recovery of these multiyear tax assessments. In addition, corporate includes special compensation expenses, which also affected our refining and marketing and midstream segments. We do not anticipate that these costs will structurally impact future corporate cost. The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of nearly $1 billion and the full year tax rate was 22%. Moving to our segment results, slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segments. Like many in the industry, several of our refineries were impacted by winter storm Elliott at the end of December, primarily in our Gulf Coast in Mid-Con regions. Most of our assets were back online after a short period, and we have not seen structural issues. The crude throughput impact was approximately 4 million barrels, which reduced our crude capacity utilization for the fourth quarter by roughly 2%. Looking to January, we anticipate impacts to throughput of 3.5 million barrels which is reflected in our guidance for the first quarter of 2023. Even with a disruption at the end of the quarter, our refining assets ran at 94% utilization, processing 2.7 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. Sequentially we saw per barrel margins decline most notably in the West Coast region, while US Gulf Coast margins were relatively flat, supported by export demand. Capture was 109% reflecting a strong result from our commercial team. Operating expenses were lower in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower energy cost partially offset by a special compensation expense of approximately $0.15 per barrel, paid in recognition for our employees contributions. Due to lower throughputs in the quarter refining operating costs per barrel were roughly flat in the fourth quarter at $5.62 per barrel as compared to the third quarter. Our full year refining operating costs per barrel is $5.41 when we compare to 2021 refining operating costs per barrel of $5.02, this increase can be entirely attributed to higher energy costs. We believe the actions we have taken to reduce our structural operating costs are sustainable. Slide 9 provides an overview of our refining and marketing capture this quarter, which was 109%. Our commercial teams executed effectively in a volatile market, light product margin tailwinds improved secondary product prices and favorable inventory impacts all benefited capture. We do not expect all of these tailwinds to be repeatable. And in particular, we would expect the inventory impacts to reverse in the first quarter. As our strategic pillar indicates we have been committed to improving our commercial performance and we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last 18 months will provide a sustainable advantage. Historically, we communicated a captured target of 95%. But over the last few years, the baseline has moved through our commercial efforts closer to 100%. We believe we have built capabilities that will provide incremental value beyond what we have realized to date, and will produce results that can be seen in our financials. Slide 10 show the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment delivered resilient fourth quarter results. We did see lower EBITDA, primarily due to impacts associated with lower NGL prices. This quarter MPLX distributions contributed $502 million in cash flow to MPC. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital was $4.4 billion in the quarter. Working Capital was a $72 million headwind for the quarter, driven mostly by declining crude prices offset by benefits from inventory impacts. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.3 billion this quarter. We saw consistent spending in refining in the fourth quarter as work progress on the Martinez Renewables fuel facility conversion and the STAR project at Galveston Bay. While not reflected in the 2022 capital spend, due to the timing of the JV close, the 50% reimbursement from Neste for Martinez capital spend, was received and reflected in overall cash flows in the third quarter. MPC returned nearly $2.2 billion via share repurchase and dividends during the quarter. We began using the incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization in November. For the full year, we returned $13.2 billion out of $17.7 billion of our 2022 cash from operations, excluding working capital impacts, representing a 75% payout. This was partially enabled by our commitment to complete our $15 billion capital return program. The outstanding purchase authorization of $7.6 billion, which includes the incremental $5 billion approval demonstrates our commitment to returning capital. At the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $11.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. Slide 12 provides their capital investment plan for 2023, which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.3 billion. The plan includes $1.25 billion for the refining and marketing segment, of which approximately $350 million or roughly 30% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance. Our growth capital plan is approximately $900 million split between low carbon and traditional projects. Within low carbon $150 million is allocated for completion of the Martinez conversion. We are also executing a project at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. This is a multiyear project. In 2023, we expect associated capital spending to be $150 million. And we have allocated $50 million to smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Within traditional refining, $150 million is associated with the completion of the STAR project. $200 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing the yields of our refineries, improving energy efficiency, and lowering our cost. In marketing, we plan to spend $150 million for projects that focus on enhancing and expanding the platform for our Marathon and ARCO brands. This morning MPLX also announced their 2023 capital investment plan of $950 million. Their plan includes approximately $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. The capital spending plan focuses on adding new gas processing plants and smaller investments targeted at expansion and debottlenecking. of existing assets to meet customer demand. Turning to guidance, slide 13, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.5 million barrels per day, representing 88% utilization. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due to turn around impacts in our US Gulf Coast region, plan turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $350 million in the first quarter, with a significant level of activity in the Gulf Coast region. The remaining scope of the STAR project, specifically 40,000 barrels per day of crude and 17,000 barrels per day of resid processing capacity is expected to be tied in during the turnaround at Galveston Bay in the first quarter, and should begin to ramp starting in the second quarter of 2023. We expect the level of 2023 turnaround spending to be similar to the level of spend in 2022. However, unlike 2022, we expect turnaround activity to be front half weighted this year, with significant planned work in the first and second quarters. Therefore, we will have executed four consecutive quarters of heavy turnaround work. Operating costs per barrel in the first quarter are expected to be flat at $5.60 per barrel for the quarter. In conjunction with our turnarounds, we anticipate higher project related expenses as we utilize our planned downtime to complete other work plans. We are seeing the benefits from lower energy costs in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions. But given the majority of our turnaround activity is heavily weighted to the Gulf Coast. Our expectations of flat operating costs quarter-to- quarter is driven by our West Coast exposure, where we have not seen a decline in energy costs recently. As we look into 2023, we anticipate our operating costs per barrel would decline and trend towards a more normalized level as we complete this turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. With that, let me pass it back to Mike. Hey, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. Let me try to break that into a couple of parts there and then see if I can -- if I've done your question justice. So in first part really the cadence if you will of the share buyback and our return of capital, as you can see from the quarter, Neil, we did $1.8 billion in share repurchase and then we continue to buy back in the month of January. Just wanted to remind you we did complete our $15 billion share repurchase in early October and I indicated on the quarterly call that we would begin using that incremental $5 billion authorization in November. So essentially for the better part of October, our cadence, we worked in the market buying back in October, just to be clear. And then we did seek and have announced an incremental $5 billion authorization. So that leaves us with $7.6 billion of share buyback authorization, hopefully indicating our continued commitment to buyback. And we hope you see that. The second part of your question, just really think around our commitment there. I think that's what you were saying. So when do we get to that $1 billion? How long does it take us and why? We feel a $1 billion is an appropriate level of cash. First, because during the pandemic, we probably stress tested our liquidity and our cash position in one of the most challenging markets. Second, I'd say keep in mind that we receive a $2 billion distribution from MPLX, probably unique when you look at us compared to our peers. So, in reality, that's about $3 billion. And then you combine that with our liquidity, we feel pretty comfortable within a range of outcomes that $1 billion is appropriate. I hope that addresses your questions, Neil. Hey, Doug, it's Maryann. I'll pass it back to Mike here in a second. But as we talked about the dividend, we committed to looking at that dividend annually. We wanted to be sure that it was secure. We wanted to be competitive with the potential to grow. And we will continue to look at that. As we've shared in the past, and obviously, as you stated, we have increased the outstanding authorization to $7.6 billion of share repurchase, we continue to think that share repurchase over dividend is an appropriate return of capital. You'll see us continuing to use that authorization as we did here in the last quarter. So, yes, we'll evaluate that dividend but we continue to see share repurchase as a bit more preferential over the dividend. I'll pass it to Mike. Sure. Thanks, Doug. As Mike indicated, our strategic pillars remained foundational, and our commercial performance is clearly one that we remain committed to, you may remember in the last set of guidance, we said that we thought our capture could actually be impacted, given what was a higher turnaround, frankly, they are highest one in 2022. But the commercial team did take quite a bit of initiative in the quarter. I'll give you some highlights and then pass it to Brian and Rick, but one of the things that we saw at 109% capture in this quarter, we had strong light product margins, we had favorable inventory impacts. And then also favorable pricing of secondaries. We we don't think necessarily all of these tailwinds would repeat, and certainly depending on where we sell pricing, some of them could actually be a headwind, particularly when we look at our secondary products. And historically, we've talked about a 95% capture rate over the last few years, given the work that the commercial team has been doing. We're moving more toward 100%. So we're going to continue to challenge ourselves to deliver that. And with that, I'll maybe ask Brian and Rick to give you some incremental color on the specifics there. Hey, Paul, it's Maryann. So you're absolutely correct. The inventory benefits that I was discussing, when talking about the capture rate we achieved in the quarter are outside the LIFO benefits. As you've seen, we've excluded the LIFO benefit from our adjusted results. So I'm talking about commercial performances, obviously, winter storm has impacts on us. And the ability for our teams to address the inventory issues is really what I was referring to when we talk about capturing the quarter not LIFO. Yes, Paul, we've not provided that level of detail on each of those individual contributors, inventory, a piece of that, again, I mentioned strong light product margins in the quarter. We saw the benefit of pricing happen on the secondaries. So there were several contributors to the upsides performance, but we typically don't provide that granular detail on this significance of each one of those. The other incremental comment that I would add to Mike's also is remember when we completed the JV with Neste, one of the things that we were looking for was incremental improvement around our feedstock slate, and we got that with a partner in Neste. So even though we are sharing 50% of the project, we actually improve the economics of the project by the feedstock that Neste is obligated to bring through their partnership with us. So just another data point as you're contemplating how to think about that."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. First off, I want to recognize a new director on the MPC board. Toni Townes-Whitley will be joining our board in March, bringing tremendous experience with her most recent executive position at Microsoft, as well as her board experience on the NASDAQ and PNC boards. Also like to recognize Christine Breves, who was appointed as a new independent director of MPLX in November, and recently served as CFO for US Steel. As we look back at 2022, we've delivered on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was just over $16 billion on a consolidated basis, and over $13 billion, excluding MPLX, reflecting our improving operating and commercial execution. Our commitment to safe and reliable operations resulted in refining utilization of 96%. And our team's dynamic responses to volatile product markets delivered strong commercial performance, resulting in a 98% full year capture. Our focus on fostering a low-cost culture enable us to sustain our previously achieved $1.5 billion of structural cost reduction throughout the year. We formed a strategic partnership with Neste, which will enhance the economics of our Martinez Renewables fuels project and create a platform for additional collaboration within renewables. In Midstream, our business grew 7% year-over-year, MPLX raise its distribution by 10%. And based on this level, we expect MPC will receive $2 billion of annual distributions. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio. And as MPLX grows its free cash flow, we believe we will continue to have the capacity to increase its capital return to unit holders. In 2022, we return nearly $12 billion through share repurchases, bringing the total repurchases to almost $17 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC's dividend 30% to $0.75 per quarter. Executing on our operating, commercial and financial objectives, combined with a strong macroenvironment led to total shareholder returns of 87% for MPC in 2022. Before Maryann goes through the results for the quarter, we wanted to share our outlook on the macroenvironment and the financial priorities for 2023. Our outlook remains bullish for \u201823 supported by the nearly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity that has come offline globally in the last couple of years. Demand for transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust. We've seen recovery in demand across all our products since coming out of the pandemic. And we anticipate further recovery in 2023, particularly as we expect consumers to adjust consumption patterns to lower retail fuel prices. Uncertainties remain around the pace and impact of China's recovery, the magnitude of a potential US or global recession and the impact of Russian product sanctions. But despite these unknowns, we believe that the current supply constraints and growing demand will support strong refining margins in \u201823. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. These includes first sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate. Second, our dividend, we are committed to the dividend which we increased 30% at the end of last year, and intend to evaluate at least annually. And as we repurchase shares, the reduction in the share count increases the ability to support future dividend growth. Third, growth capital. We believe this is a return on and return of capital business. We've been through a progressive change over the last few years and remain focused on ensuring the competitiveness of our assets as we progress through the energy evolution. We will invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. In traditional refining, we're focused on investments that enhance the competitiveness of our assets. In the low carbon area, investment at this time is primarily associated with the completion of the Martinez Renewables project, as well as a project at our LA refinery that will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. In addition, we're focused on growth opportunities in emerging technologies, as well as opportunities enabled by digital transformation. Beyond these three objectives, we're also returning s excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. In the period from early November through the end of January, we've completed nearly $2.4 billion of share repurchases. And today, we announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization, reinforcing our commitment to strong capital returns. Our goal is to be the investment of choice in the refining space, generating the most through cycle cash flow, creating value through strategic deployment of capital and delivering superior returns to our shareholders. We also challenged ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce GHG emissions, methane emissions and freshwater intensity targets which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible path to accomplish. As we innovate for the future, Phase 1 of our Martinez Renewables fuel facilities progressing startup activities, marking a significant milestone in our sustainable energy goals. The facility is on track to reach full Phase 1 production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of the first quarter 2023. Pretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of \u201823, which will enable the facility to ramp up to its full expected capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. At Dickinson, we've optimized operations to be able to bringing in more advantage feedstocks, lowering the carbon intensity of the fuels we produce. We've enhanced our position in the renewables value chain through our pretreatment facilities in Beatrice and Cincinnati. We'll continue to look for opportunities leveraging the strategic partnerships we're cultivating with Neste and ADM. As evidence of our progress on our sustainability goals, this year, MTC was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the fourth consecutive year. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann. Thanks Maryann. In summary, we believe solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. Similar to what we've achieved with cost reductions and portfolio. We believe the improvements we've made to our commercial and operational execution have driven structural sustainable benefits, which will enable us to capture opportunities, irrespective of the market environment. Our goal is to position MPC as the refiner investment of choice, generating the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital. Let me turn the call back to Kristina. Neil, it's Mike. Let me just add to what Maryann just said. So we had been at about $1.6 billion from MPLS, moved up to $1.8 billion, we're now at $2 billion pace, we expect that to continue to grow. If people listen to the MPLX call, we're in a real good position there. But that distribution, let's say at the $2 billion pace, that essentially covers the dividend, and half of the refining capital commitment for refining. So that's part of the reason that we are comfortable with $1 billion on the balance sheet. Now, as you pointed out, we still finished the year with close to $12 billion on the balance sheet. So we still have a lot of financial capability to get to a new normal at some point, but hopefully that helps explain why the $1 billion is the right number. And it has to do with our affiliation with MPLX. Yes, Neil, thanks for that question. It's one we've been getting from a lot of people. So it's relatively easy to model. So up until now, the parts of STAR that are in place are in our results. What's not in our results, is 40,000 barrels a day of crude capacity. And the easiest way to model is take that number times the differential between heavy crude, and ULSD. So if you look at that differential, and you multiply it by 40,000 barrels a day, that's the additional EBITDA that we'll get once STAR is online. But STAR is a pretty unique project for us. So I'm going to ask Tim to make a couple of comments on it. So you have the financial side of it, but let me give you a little bit of the background behind it with Tim some details, please. Yes, Doug, I'll just add to what Maryann said, obviously, we want to have a competitive dividend and a growing dividend over time. So that is foundational to us. It is a little bit tax inefficient relative to share buybacks. That's why Maryann just said that we leaned a little more that way. And the sheer magnitude of the financial capacity we have right now with finishing the year with about $12 billion of cash on the balance sheet and continuing to have a strong refining environment, just the sheer magnitude is much more towards that side of the return of capital. So we're going to look at it, we've committed that we'll look at it each year, and we want to be committed to it. At the end of the day, obviously, a lot of our attention just because of the magnitude of the number is directed towards the repurchase program. Doug. It's a good question. So I'm going to pass it to Maryann in a second. But when we started this out a couple of years ago, we said there's three areas that we're going to concentrate heavily on, one of them was improving our commercial performance. So let Maryann give a little more color on that. Roger, it's Mike. The only thing that I would add is we feel really good about the project. And the team's execution has been good. But in light of where the refining macro is today it's not the contributor that it would be saying it when we get back to midcycle at some point, it's going to be a meaningful contributor, but obviously, it's dwarfed by what's happening in refining today. Hey, Paul, it's Mike, we haven't disclosed the multiyear, we will give more color on that as time goes on. What Tim was trying to say is, it is a multiyear project, and we're going to start off with it. It'll be $150 million this year, and we'll give more color as time goes by. John, it's Mike, I'll start off. We've broken it into two buckets, traditional refining and low carbon. And it's our expectation that low carbon bucket will continue to grow over time and at the same time, though, we do have a bunch of projects Tim just mentioned one that will really improve the competitiveness of LA, we have a bunch of those still, that we think we can implement on the traditional refining side as well. So I think you're going to see a nice blend on both sides of the business there over time. I don't think you should expect that number to be going meaningfully down. Yes, I know, people have talked a lot about STAR but we have enough projects that we think are attractive returns, we just want to implement them over time and be disciplined on the way that we allocate capital, but I think you're going to see both buckets and not have an expectation they're going down, because we still think there's a decent amount of return on capital opportunities for us in light of what's been a major return of capital recently from us. Yes, Jason, we don't give specific individual facility earnings profiles. I know it's a question and people have been trying to get their arms around. But the best guidance I can give you is if you look at the macroenvironment around the California market, and where each of the subsidies are trading, the key to remember because people ask us about LCFS. But there are other components to subsidy out there that all kind of worked together. And the three of them together have been relatively consistent, even though a lot of them are moving around a little bit. So that should help you a little bit as you model it. And then obviously, look at where feedstocks are trading and diesel's trading."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Sounds great. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to introduce Tim Aydt, who will be joining our call as a new Executive Vice President of Refining. Tim has over 37 years of experience in leadership roles across our midstream and refining organizations. Most recently, he was Executive Vice President of Pipelines, Terminals and Marine and Chief Commercial Officer, where he oversaw the business development for the MLP. Now turning to the macro environment. Roughly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity has come offline globally in the last couple of years. Yet demand for the transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust and continues to grow. In the U.S., demand is still below 2019 pre-COVID levels, and we believe there will be a continued recovery. As supply remains constrained and demand continues to rebound, we maintain a bullish outlook towards the refining environment as we look into 2023. Our third quarter results reflect the team's operational and commercial execution as we focused on delivering products for consumers in this very tight market. In our Refining segment, we ran near full rates while maintaining our steadfast commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. The commercial team focused on optimizing our scale, footprint and feedstock slate to deliver against strong demand. And despite volatility in the global energy markets, our execution reflects progress towards our goal of improving commercial performance. We normally see seasonal demand decline at this time of the year but to date, we're not seeing those signs. Strong forward crack spreads and wide salary differentials for 2023 indicate the expectation of a strong refining environment going forward. In the fourth quarter, we're currently running our system at full utilization, except for the planned maintenance activity we have occurring given our back of the year weighted turnaround schedule. Aside from the Refining business, I want to point out that our Midstream segment earnings continue to grow. In the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 9% year-over-year in midstream. We've been executing strategic capital investments, fostering a low-cost culture and optimizing the portfolio, including advancing several organic growth projects in the Permian Basin. The strength of these cash flows supports MPLX's decision to increase its quarterly distribution by 10%. Based on this level, MPC will receive $2 billion of distribution from MPLX annually. We've received questions regarding the structure of MPLX and whether MPC will acquire the outstanding public unit. So we want to restate what we said in the past. MPLX is a strategic part of MPC's portfolio, its current pace of cash distributions to MPC is $2 billion per year, and we expect that to continue growing. MPLX has continued to demonstrate resilient through-cycle earnings and growing cash flows. As MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic partnership will continue to be enhanced, and we do not plan to roll up MPLX. Switching to capital allocation, we believe MPC's current capital allocation priorities are optimal for our shareholders. In October, we completed our $15 billion return of capital commitment, repurchasing approximately 30% of MPC's shares outstanding. We're committed to executing our capital allocation framework to deliver peer-leading total return to shareholders. Today, we announced an increase to MPC's quarterly dividend of approximately 30%. In addition, we intend to continue repurchases, which we believe are a more efficient way to return capital and we expect to commence buybacks in November using the remaining $5 billion repurchase authorization. In early 2000, we shared our three strategic areas of focus. They have become part of MPC's DNA embedded in our unwavering commitment to increase profitability, have the best through-cycle cash flow generation and drive a long-term value creation. As we focus on strengthening the competitive position of our assets, in September, we closed on our Martinez Renewables joint venture with Neste. Construction is well underway, and we expect Phase 1 mechanical completion by year-end. We're excited about the partnership with Neste, a global leader in feedstock procurement and renewable fuels production. This joint venture enhances the value of the project by reducing MPC's capital commitment to $0.55 per gallon as well as improving the overall project feedstock slate. Neste has the obligation to bring 80% advantaged feedstock in Phase 2. Due to these improvements, we expect MPC share in the JV's EBITDA to be only 25% lower than our original stand-alone case. Additionally, this strategic partnership with Neste creates a platform for collaboration. We believe there will be opportunities to leverage the differentiated knowledge and capabilities of two industry leaders as we pursue our shared commitment to the energy evolution. We continue to challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy and have made progress on the sustainability goals that we have set for ourselves. Focusing specifically on the Martinez Renewables project which converts our petroleum refinery into a renewable fuels facility. We anticipate the conversion to result in a 60% reduction of the facility's Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, 70% lower total criteria air pollutants and 1 billion gallons of water saved annually. If you haven't had a chance yet, we invite you to go to the Sustainability section of our website and learn more about the ways we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Moving to third quarter results. Slide 6 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.81. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude three items: a $549 million noncash pretax gain related to the contribution of our refining assets to the Martinez Renewables JV, a $509 million noncash gain related to an MPLX third-party contract reclassification and a $28 million LIFO inventory charge. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.8 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes was just under $4.5 billion. During the quarter, we returned $285 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $3.9 billion of our shares. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.3 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing as the blended crack spread was down approximately $10 per barrel, reflecting a 25% quarterly decline. The tax rate for the third quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of $1.4 billion. The tax rate is similar to last quarter due to the Refining & Marketing representing a larger component of total earnings. Moving to our segment slide results. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. During the quarter, we focused on supplying transportation fuels to meet continued strong market demand. Our Refining assets ran at 98% utilization processing over 2.8 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. We saw margins decline sequentially across all three regions. Capture was 97%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team in a volatile global market. Operating expenses were higher in the third quarter. Energy costs were approximately $0.15 per barrel higher in the third quarter, driven by higher natural gas prices. Additionally, we recorded a nonrecurring multiyear property tax assessment of $0.13 per barrel in the third quarter, which we will continue to pursue recovery. We believe the actions we have taken to bring our structural operating cost down to approximately $5 per barrel are sustainable. The cost increases we have seen year-to-date have almost entirely been driven by higher energy costs. Turning to Slide 9, which provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter. Market backwardation remained a headwind for the industry but our commercial strategy of selling ahead of product backwardation while keeping inventories optimized, supported our ability to meet demand and capture strong prompt margins. And while not as significant as the previous quarter, secondary product prices were a headwind as they lagged higher light product prices. Our ability to capture 97% of the market indicator across an incredibly volatile three months was in part due to our commercial responses. Slide 10 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the second quarter of 2022, our Midstream segment demonstrated earnings growth with adjusted EBITDA up approximately 3% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. Overall, we continue to focus on identifying and efficiently executing high-return projects to drive further growth for our midstream business. As Mike mentioned earlier, the growth of MPLX's earnings supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by 10% to $0.775 per share and MPC expects to receive $2 billion in cash from MPLX on an annual basis. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and as MPLX grows its free cash flow we believe it will have the capacity to return capital to its unitholders. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter, operating cash flow excluding changes in working capital, was just under $4.5 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $1.9 billion headwind for the quarter. This quarter, we made a payment of $2.3 billion for estimated federal income taxes declining crude prices or also a headwind to working capital. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $756 million this quarter. The increased level of capital spending was related to a ramp in activity related to the Martinez Renewables fuels facility conversion and the Galveston Bay store project. The STAR project is expected to be completed early 2023. Other cash flow benefits of $790 million is primarily driven by the distribution MPC receipt from the Martinez Renewables JV upon closing on September 21. At the end of the third quarter, MPC had approximately $11.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Moving to Slide 12. We have completed our $15 billion share repurchase commitment, utilizing the proceeds from the Speedway divestiture at an average price of $78, ahead of our commitment of no later than the end of 2022. As you will see today, when our quarterly financials, the 10-Q was published, we were able to complete that early in the month of October. We intend to begin repurchase against our $5 billion outstanding authorization in November, now that our financials are public. On Slide 13, I'd like to walk you through our financial priorities, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. We're committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We believe the quarterly increase to $0.75 per share we announced today is secured through cycles, competitive with peers and the broader market and leaves opportunity to potentially grow our dividend in the future. We anticipate this dividend will be supplemented with repurchases and we are committed to executing our capital allocation framework to deliver peer-leading total returns to shareholders. We will evaluate growth opportunities and margin enhancing projects. Share repurchases will be used to return excess capital to shareholders, which we believe are a more efficient way to return capital and will continue to lower our share count. Underpinning these priorities, we believe a strong balance sheet is essential to being successful in a competitive commodity business. It's the foundation, allowing us to execute our strategy. On Slide 14, we highlight the strength of MPC's balance sheet. We continue to manage our balance sheet through an investment-grade credit profile. At the end of our third quarter, MPC stand-alone gross debt to capital ratio is 21% which is under our target of a 25% to 30% gross debt-to-capital ratio. MPLX has a leverage ratio of 3.5x debt to EBITDA under its target of 4x. Both businesses have strong balance sheet with leverage ratios under their respective targets. Turning to guidance on Slide 15, we provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day, representing 93% utilization. Utilization is forecast to be lower than third quarter due to planned turnaround activity having a higher impact on crude units in the fourth quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $430 million in the fourth quarter with a significant level of activity in the Gulf Coast region. Turnaround activity is reflected in our fourth quarter throughput guidance. We are expecting operating cost per barrel in the fourth quarter to be lower projected to be $5.30 per barrel for the quarter. This is primarily driven by expected lower natural gas and energy costs. As a reminder, natural gas has historically represented approximately 15% of operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity is approximately $330 million of annual EBITDA for every dollar change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. In closing, we will continue to execute on our three strategic pillars, strengthening the competitive performance of our assets, fostering a low-cost culture and improving our commercial performance. We are committed to position MPC as a reliable and efficient energy provider with new investments focused on high-return opportunities supporting the company's evolution, which will position it to lead in an energy diverse future. We will stay steadfast in our plan to position MPC as the refiner investment of choice, striving to deliver superior cash returns regardless of market conditions, and while ensuring we safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, operator, can you open up for questions today.\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nDouglas Leggate: Thank you, guys. Sorry, trouble with the mute button. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess Mike or Maryann, whichever one wants to take this. Now that you've completed the buyback or at least the first phase of the buyback -- your distributions from MPLX were still more than covering your dividend. So can you kind of walk us through how you think about what the new pace of buybacks could look like? Because obviously, the $5 billion authorization is probably going to be true through fairly quickly. And what we should think of in terms of the balance between future dividend growth and where you want your balance sheet to be? Basically, it's a use of cash question because this is a pretty nice problem to have. And then I've got a follow-up, please.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Doug. So as you know, we made a commitment that we would reassess the dividend immediately completing the $15 billion, and we've done so. We wanted three objectives really around the dividend. One was for it to be secure competitive. And then obviously, with the potential to grow dividends in the future, as you said, we believe our increase to $0.75 in the quarter meets all three of those objectives. As you know, we completed that $15 billion share authorization and have a remaining $5 billion new authorization, which both Mike and I had shared on our prepared remarks that we intend to begin to use that very early in the month of November. We continue to think that our equity is undervalued. And when we look at distribution return on capital between dividend and share repurchase, we believe share repurchase remains a more efficient tool in that portfolio. So we'll look at market, we'll look at other growth opportunities, and we'll look at the macro, and we'll continue to use share repurchase absent other growth opportunities as the vehicle to continue to return capital to the shareholders and every decision that we make, obviously, focused on trying to ensure we've got peer-leading returns. I hope that helps, Doug.\nDouglas Leggate: It does, Maryann. Sadly, it also prompts my follow-up if I may. And it's a little bit of a, I guess, a less easy question to answer. And you just made the point of -- that you believe your equity is undervalued. Now we obviously agree with that, but your share price is at an all-time high. So when we think about value when the market thinks about value, there have to be some assumptions that go behind how you're defining value. So my question is, what's the mid-cycle to the extent you can define it EBITDA or cash flow that you anticipate from the portfolio that goes behind that statement of we believe our equity is undervalued? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nMaryann Mannen: Doug, I'll start off, and I'm sure Mike will want to add incremental comment as well. I think the mid-cycle is an extremely difficult way for us to put a pin in as we stand right now. Certainly, when we look at the market dynamics, as Mike shared as well, we remain pretty bullish on the outlook, not only for the fourth quarter, but certainly as we head into 2023. So a series of factors that we use and we look at to determine when we say we believe that equity is undervalued, and we'll continue to be as opportunistic as we can as we are using share repurchase in evaluating where both the fourth and the first quarter will go and, frankly, longer term. So several factors that we consider, but we certainly look right now at a fairly optimistic outlook for the next several quarters.\nMichael Hennigan: And Doug, it's Mike. I'll add to Maryann's comments. So what I said in the prepared remarks is the fundamentals of the business have changed as a result of what's happened over the last couple of years -- roughly 4 million barrels of refining capacity has come out of the market. At a time early on when demand was down, but demand continues to recover. We're still not at 2019 levels of demand across all the products, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel. So we're still below, but we are slowly recovering. So you have supply constrained, you got demand recovering. And to your point, the mid-cycle that we see into the future is clearly above the previous mid-cycle because the global fundamentals have changed. And as we look out in time, there are going to be some capacity additions occurring throughout the world, but we also believe that demand is going to continue to pace such that the new mid-cycle for what we're going to see is significantly above where we've been in the past. So that's obviously why we have a bullish overtone here and why we still believe that the assets that we have are still trading under intrinsic value. Now I know you'd love us to give the exact number what we call internally. So I'm not going to do that, as you know but we stress tested. We stress tested in a low case, our view of a mid case and our view of a higher case. And as we look at all those things, we still believe fundamentally that we can purchase our shares at a price that's still adding value to our shareholders. So that's why we've been so aggressive in that area. We had committed to that return. As Maryann said in the prepared remarks, we bought back at a pretty good number, and we still see that as an ongoing opportunity. You also asked about the dividend. I mean our dividend being where it was, was mainly because of the equity price coming up. And we did feel it weren't an adjustment. People had asked us for several quarters in a row, whether we're going to do that. And we said we're going to do it after we do the $15 billion of Speedway. So hopefully, we were consistent with what we said there. We've moved it up as Maryann said, it's not a tax-efficient way to return to shareholders. But we want to have a competitive number as well. So 30% is a good bump. We'll keep an eye on that. And at the same time, we're going to continue to reduce the share count. Hopefully, that gives you a little more color.\nDouglas Leggate: You make significantly higher mid-cycle as what I was looking for. Thanks very much indeed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning team. The first question is really to build on your comments around commercial. The capture rates have continued to come in very well over the last couple of quarters. And Mike, I know when you came into the role, one of the opportunities you identified was really strengthening your commercial effort. So can you just talk about what specifically has driven sort of that improvement in capture rates? And how much of that is because of those commercial initiatives?\nMichael Hennigan: Yes. Thanks, Neil, for the question. I'm going to let Rick and Brian comment. But I'll -- before they do, I would say to you, we did say early on that we had three major areas that we're going to put emphasis on and we've made progress in the commercial area. We still see a lot more opportunity for us. So we're not done in that area, but we have made some progress. I'll let Rick and Brian give some comments.\nRick Hessling: Yes, Neil, it's Rick. Thank you for the question. It's one of these items where we've been looking at the pull through, and we've been seeing it the last several quarters. So it's nice that you're noticing it as well. I would start by saying earlier this year, we changed a lot. We changed processes, we change structure and culture around all things commercial that's been a game changer for us. In terms of details and how competitively, I'll be careful in what I share here, Neil. But if you look at it over were through a broad lens, we've stood up a dedicated what we call VCO team, value chain optimization team that goes from end-to-end, from feedstocks to products from purchasing or procuring to placement and we're relooking at everything we do, the why, the how, all modeling constraints, assumptions, everything was put on the table and relooked at. And so a lot of change and great positive results have come out of that, especially in the midst of the environment we're in. So every win, when you're in an environment like we're in today is exemplified with the high crack and I think you're seeing that. In addition, you're seeing a lot of the re root of global products and feedstocks happening throughout the world. And through this initiative, we've been able to take advantage of a lot of purchasing of feedstock and the placement of our feed -- clean products in a time that has been highly advantageous. So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for more color on the clean side.\nBrian Partee: Thanks, Rick. Yes, Neil, just great question. I appreciate the opportunity to kind of weigh in here. And Rick said it, but I'll double down on it. It's about one or two things. It's literally everything. We've changed. We've moved mountains and really proud of the work that the team has done. There's been a lot of progress, as Mike alluded to in his comments, there's more to get. I think foundationally, as we look going forward, one of the key components is our digital transformation that underpins a lot of the efforts we have on the commercial front. And we think leveraging our scale across our coast-to-coast platform provides us a distinct opportunity set as it relates to that digital evolution in our space. The other thing I'd say just real quick is what underpins all this? Or alignment changed everything. We fundamentally changed the organizational structure and realign people, we empowered people and we held them accountable. We have a people-centric business in the commercial space, and we're really leveraging that. And the core tenet of what we're trying to accomplish is to let our great people do great things.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, that's great color. So it's showing up in the numbers. And as the follow-up is just a specific dynamic gravity stock. We've seen WCS really blow out. Historically, you guys have been one of the larger buyers of Western Canadian crude. But do you also see heavy wider in barrels like Maya and high-sulfur fuel oil. So maybe you talk about what's driving the weakness in the heavy crude and product markets and how are you optimizing your refining slate to take advantage of that?\nRick Hessling: Yes, hi Neil, it's Rick again. So great question. These markets are blowing out. We're seeing unprecedented levels again. On the heavy side, I think I looked this morning and I saw the forward curve. December was marked at minus 30, Q1, minus 27 and unbelievably stoked. 2023 Cal was 23 under, So what's driving it? Boy, it is a plethora of items. Production from the Canadian front, Neil, is pretty solid and we're entering right now blending season, as you know, the diluent blending season is slowing the pool, which is certainly helping as well. We've had some short-term shot in the arms with some maintenance in PADD 2, 3 and 5. When I say maintenance, unplanned maintenance, that's been a plug for us. And then fuel oil is really cheap. So you're seeing a lot of people substitute that for heavies in other parts of the world. So all of this is driving -- is really putting pressure on anything that hits the U.S. Gulf Coast. And lastly, I'll say, when you look at the Gulf of Mexico medium sour production, it's been healthy as well. So lately here, you're seeing Mars blow out. Certainly, you referenced the Canadians. So all of these items are stacking on top of one another and creating for a very bullish outlook here into 2023. In terms of MPC specifically, I think you are well aware, we have great access and optionality that we've built out our system over the years in PADD 2, PADD 3 and now PADD 5 and so we are going heavy. We're heavying up our slate. We're filling up our cokers as you would expect, and we'll continue to do so into Q3 as these indicators tell us to do so.\nNeil Mehta: It makes sense. Thank you, team.\nRick Hessling: You're welcome, Neil.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: Yes, thank you. Good morning.\nMichael Hennigan: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: Let me take the diesel question that everybody wants to ask on all these calls, kind of what you're seeing across your system? Whether or not the Mississippi River issues had anything to do with what's going on in the Central part of the country and -- and just any thoughts you have on some of the policy issues that are percolating out there in terms of any risk of government intervention on the diesel export front?\nBrian Partee: Yes, Roger, this is Brian Partee. I can take that. There's a couple of different things to unpack there. First on the Mississippi River. We have a really strong and capable Inland River system and team. We've got over 20 tugs and 300 barges. We largely operate on the Ohio River, but also do transit the Mississippi. And the team has been working extremely hard over the last several months making sure the product continues to flow. So I can say there's been no impact, but it's been on the heels of our team working very diligently hard and positioning the right equipment in the lower Mississippi River to make sure that we don't have disruptions. So on that front, things have been going pretty well. As it relates to the ongoing dialog with the administration, we have had frequent engagement and communication, which has been welcomed. I think it's good to share and understand each other's perspective. And as it relates to the export ban, I think that through the dialog, there's been general consensus and understanding that, that likely would be counterproductive the goals and objectives of building inventory and reducing prices. I mean, fundamentally, if you look at our 2.5 million barrels of exports in the U.S., we just don't have enough demand to back it in. We've got grade mixes. We've got logistics disconnect. So I think there's been broad understanding and engagement that, that's not the best course of action. Now all that being said, I just can't speak on behalf of the administration, I think anything is on the table at any time.\nMichael Hennigan: Hey Roger, it's Mike. I'll just add to Brian, I'll give you my thoughts on it. Number one is I do think the administration understands that a ban would not have the effect that they were originally looking for and instead would decrease inventory levels, reduce refining capacity and actually put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices, which is not what they were intending. So I think given these potential outcomes, it's my opinion, that the administration would not pursue that path. But that's just -- that's my thought at this point.\nRoger Read: Yes, I follow that, but then see a wish for a windfall profit tax, which would be unlikely to lower prices either based on experience. So you just don't -- never know what they might decide they want to do or feel forced to. I threw a lot into that. So I'll turn it over -- or turn it back over. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJohn Royall: Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So on the OpEx guidance for 4Q, I'm surprised to see it down from 3Q levels given you have more turn relative to 3Q. So anything to point to there either something from 3Q that's non-repeating or anything in 4Q in particular?\nMaryann Mannen: Sure, John. It's Maryann. So in the third quarter, we had really three things that were largely equally weighted, that impacted the actual results in the quarter. The first, as you mentioned, was -- I call it a one-time. We had about a $0.13 impact from a four-year adjustment on property tax costs. Unfortunately, the state has the ability to go back and do that. So that is non-repeating. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll go after that and continue to pursue it. But unfortunately, when it's live, we need to record it. So that was in the quarter. Second, obviously, higher energy costs just in general, quarter-over-quarter, as I mentioned. And then the last piece, to your point, in the third quarter, given the level of back half-weighted turnaround expenses or other activities associated with that or higher. When we gave guidance for the fourth quarter, we certainly see energy costs somewhat nat gas related decline in Q3 to Q4. And obviously, the tax impact, we do not expect to repeat. I hope that addresses the question.\nMichael Hennigan: John, it's Mike. Let me just add to what Maryann just said. So we try our best to give you as good a guidance as we can with the one caveat being where is natural gas price going to be? So we look at the forward curve right before we give the guidance and just reminding you the sensitivity is $0.30 a barrel for every $1 per million BTUs. So where that actually ends up in the quarter is hard to call. So we just take a look at the forward curve ahead of time and put our best number on it. So what I feel good about is the areas that we control on cost. I continue to say we have sustainable reductions that we've seen over the last couple of years, and that's good. As Maryann mentioned, we have a tax dispute that we'll follow up on. And we have this unknown as to where natural gas will actually price itself throughout the whole quarter. Hopefully, that helps.\nJohn Royall: It does. Thank you. And then just a follow-up to Neil's question on capture rates. I think you went into some kind of the broader dynamics. But just -- just wanted to be relative to the commentary that it would be down. And I think you touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but just kind of some of the moving pieces there. And then in order in 4Q, it's looking to me like it's a heavy maintenance quarter relative to 3Q and then you have price moving up -- is a total perception, should we think -- do you think about that number kind of pointed down in 4Q?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey John, Maryann, I'll start and then I'll pass it to Rick and Brian to give you any incremental color. But you're right, when I provided guidance on capture for the third quarter, knowing that we had a fairly strong third and fourth quarter, frankly, but third quarter compared to the second quarter turnaround activity, we expected that we would have seen some capture impact as a result. Having said that, there were certainly some offsetting elements in the quarter. First, as you know, we actually saw prices come down a bit and those lower prices actually improved our clean product margins. Pricing actually really did benefit as we looked at the volumetric gains quarter-over-quarter. And then while secondaries were still a headwind in the quarter, they were better than what we had initially projected. Your question was a little bit tough, you were cutting in and out. But as we talk about the fourth quarter, I think, is what you were asking as well. Obviously, it will be, as you've seen from the guidance, our heaviest turnaround month of all -- excuse me, quarter of all four quarters. So we would certainly anticipate that capture in the fourth quarter could be below what we saw in the third quarter for some of those very reasons. But let me pass it to Rick and Brian to give you incremental color. I think Mike wants it too.\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, before we pass to the other guys, John, I just want to remind everybody that when Q2 margins were as high as they were, we made a conscious decision to delay some activity into the back half of the year, specifically into the fourth quarter. At that time, we felt it was a good idea, provided there was no safety issues or anything to make that adjustment. So some of what's happened here is we've traded some Q2 margin for Q4 margin and we still think that was a good call, but it has loaded up a little bit more activity in the fourth quarter as far as our turnaround activity.\nRick Hessling: John, this is Rick. I'll just add to Maryann's earlier comments and make a comment on secondary product margins. So we're one month into the quarter. We'll see where the next two months go. But secondary product margins have been so volatile and trying to predict where WTI is going to go from here is anyone's guess. I would say that's one of the biggest wildcards on where our capture will end up. So -- more to come there. We'll see how the rest of the quarter plays out. And with that, I'll see if Brian has any color to add.\nBrian Partee: Yes, thanks, Rick. Just one quick summary wrap-up comment. It's hard to call the ball one month into the quarter, but I will say that October from a clean products perspective, started off strong, as Mike indicated in his opening commentary, we did not see the seasonal turndown in demand. We've had weather working largely in our favor. We haven't had a Hurricane event in the country as a whole has been pretty moderate on the weather front. We did see -- we've seen strong demand throughout the month of October. And correspondingly, we've seen strong margins as well. So directionally, I think, favorable but too early to call the ball.\nJohn Royall: Very helpful, thank you.\nBrian Partee: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nSam Margolin: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question.\nBrian Partee: Good morning, Sam.\nSam Margolin: Wanted to ask on the renewable diesel business. You mentioned Neste brings some benefit on the feedstock procurement side. You also have the JV with Archer-Daniels. So you're covered across categories within the feedstock universe, and there's a lot of disparity between vegetable oils and waste oils right now. And so I'm just curious how you think about the feedstock picture overall, whether it's important to really have security on both sides or if you might be leaning towards one specific category of feed stock over another?\nBrian Partee: Yes, Sam, this is Brian. I'll take that question. It's a great question. So, first, let me just back up and talk a little bit about what we have going on out west with Martinez. So we're well into our prefill strategy. So we've been prefielding since middle of the summer. We're currently buying from over 50 different suppliers. So we forayed into this business two years ago with Dickinson and the team has come up very, very fast in developing those relationships.\n.: So we've quickly gone from not being in the business to being holistically in the business with two different plants here shortly, pretreat capacity. And we're confident, very confident in our ability to source optimal feedstocks. But it's really an optimization much like we undertake on the crude side of our business. We run an LP model. We look at unit constraints at the refinery, we look at logistics, we look at pricing and of course, CI value. So it's a broad optimization, very similar to what we do on the crude side of our business.\nSam Margolin: Okay. Thanks. And then speaking of optimization on the Refining side, maybe if we could go back in time to the MarkWest acquisition a number of years ago, a big part of that was NGL integration into the refineries or at least there was a contemplated synergy. And now we've got a pretty noteworthy NGL dislocation and specifically butane. And I wonder if that relationship is, as you imagined it at that time or if in the process of your sort of commercial transformation, if you've fenced them off or organize them differently?\nRick Hessling: Yes, hi Sam, it's Rick. So the call out is outstanding, especially in these low NGL price environments we're in right now. So when you look at the logistics of combining MWE and MPC and our total footprint, it's incredible today, especially as we optimize our octane with NGLs and heading into the butane blending season. Really, to answer your question, it's yes and yes. Yes, we saw this coming to the extent it is here today. I would say it's -- it's certainly a nice shot in the arm for us as we optimize around our system, both from specifically butane and all things NGLs tied to our -- tied to our whole system. We're seeing specific benefits certainly on the Gulf Coast with Garyville, but it's throughout our entire system. So a great call out.\nSam Margolin: Thanks so much. Have a great day.\nRick Hessling: You're welcome.\nOperator: Up next, we have Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Hey guys, good morning. Two questions. First, I want to go back into the [indiscernible] stock. On the -- recently that we have seen the CI adjusted pretreated soybean oil price is mainly comparable to the UCO, the Used Cooking Oil. So want to see that how you guys see that? And why do you think that may -- that has happened? And do you think that this trend is going to sustain and corresponding the impact on your feedstock strategy? So that's the first question. The second question is related to maybe that -- how the IRA and also that the timing LCFS prices that we have seen over the past four months impacting your renewable longer-term outlook and strategy? Thank you.\nBrian Partee: Yes, Paul, thanks. This is Brian. I understand the question. So first on CI as it relates to soybean oil, UCO and actually even some of the other feedstocks that we look at. I would say that we're at a point or we've been at a point here in the last several months where we like ourselves and others have been in startup mode. So there's been a bit of a surge in demand in acquiring feedstocks as it relates to start-up. And the market broadly is not super-efficient yet. So it's an emerging market. Relationships matter. A lot of the sellers in this space, so whether it's UCO or rendered fats. It's a new business line for them. So there's a lot of exploration ongoing. So I don't think it's a structural change as we've seen here in the last couple of months. But I do think it's just the nature of the market evolving from a CI perspective. But as I said earlier, to Sam's question, I think logistics are going to be key. Those relationships are going to be key to make sure we get the right feedstocks, the most advantaged feedstocks into our facilities. Your second question related to LCFS. Certainly, we've seen the supply and demand of LCFS credits to gap out here over the last 1.5 years or so. The one point I'd make here is we're seeing that in California, that there's other states, other areas, Canada, Oregon that have emerging programs. So that's a new variable that's entering into the equation and calculus for us and others in terms of where you actually place the product. So we reported -- CARB reported a pretty big build for the second quarter. Credit is still a little over 1.3 million credit in the second quarter. So that surplus continues to grow. We do expect CARB, they're going through a scoping assessment now on the LCFS program. We do expect them to make adjustments to the plan going forward to really support the investments needed on the low carbon side of things. I think that will be an opportunity in 2023 to engage and discuss and probably something we see manifest in 2024. Ultimately, the economics as it relates to RV are really founded on several interrelated variables. We've had the positive side of that on the RIN and the Blenders Tax Credit. Certainly, the product pricing in California has been supportive. So that's all been on the positive side. Feedstock pricing, although stable through the third quarter has been towards the higher side as we think about this year. And then as you mentioned, the LCFS have been the lower side. But all that combined considered, we're seeing stable margin production out of our Dickinson facility, and we'd expect the same out in Martinez, just through a variety of different variables.\nMichael Hennigan: Hi, Paul, it's Mike. I just want to add a comment. We've been talking about Martinez for a while now. And early on, we said that in order to have a terrific facility, we wanted to have competitive CapEx and I think everybody has seen our numbers on that. We've disclosed that. OpEx, we're in a really good position with the former refinery asset. Brian has talked about, we're pretty bullish to the logistics assets that we have set up here and the last piece of the puzzle was feedstocks that which you're asking about, and Brian just gave you some color on our side. Plus, I do want to reiterate, that was part of the driver for our partnership with Neste. We know their portfolio and see them as a global leader in this area. So it was one of the key factors that enabled us to say we wanted to JV with them. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we think there's more to come with the relationship with Neste. We're working on different things together as we feel that we've had a win-win for both sides of this but feedstock procurement is actually one of the most important parts of this and kind of the last leg of the stool after we talked about CapEx, OpEx and logistics. So hopefully, that helps.\nPaul Cheng: Sure. Just curious, do you guys have any plan to add additional development plan or now the plan, sales at a next one or two years? Or that you just have the machines going to bump up and you're going to wait until that's fully ramp up. So what type of strategy that you guys have in mind?\nMichael Hennigan: Yes. So we're not sure what you said. Kristina said, you thought you heard you say, are we adding alkeplants, did you say alke or?\nPaul Cheng: No, I'm saying that I hear what you say about the [indiscernible] curious that now you have the renewable diesel plant in that going to come up very soon. And so what is the next step in your strategy? Do you plan to add additional new facility or new development in the area before you fully stand up on the material or that you say, okay, we just have some major investment on the space and that's run it for a couple of years before we look for the next addition?\nMichael Hennigan: Okay. Understood it was RD. Yes. I think, Paul, it's more the latter. We have some things going. I'll let Dave make a few comments on some of the areas that we're looking at. But -- but we'll have Martinez started up here very shortly within a couple of months. We're going to mechanically complete at the end of the year. So it's probably a little more latter to the scenario that you played out but the whole area continues to evolve. So Dave, why don't you give a little color on some of the things that we're looking at.\nDavid Heppner: Yes, Paul. This is Dave. So I think, as Mike stated, while we have Dickinson up and going, and we're bringing Martinez online, both Phase 1 and Phase 3 even with the Neste JV, part of our strategy, and Brian touched on a lot of it from feedstock all the way to product placement is, I won't say replicating the hydrocarbon value chain, but leveraging our core companies are strengths that we've shown in the commercial value we can extract out of participating up and down that value chain. Probably a little bit of a difference from the hydrocarbon to the renewable is we don't want to get over our skis and maybe outside of our core competencies, and we also want to hedge speed to market. Hence, the reason you're seeing our relationships, our JVs will use them, our partnerships with ADM and Neste, for example. So as Mike stated, we're going to continue to evaluate new opportunities. We look at a lot of stuff, but it needs to be capital efficient. The IRA is -- could be some tailwind as you look at this. But I still think it's a little early to see how some of those variables all play out and the actual mechanics of the IRA before we can make long-term investment strategies. Thank you.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nDavid Heppner: You're welcome, Paul.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. First, I wanted to touch on your comments about demand across your system. Your earlier comments about being down in 2019. Was that specific to your assets? Or were you talking about the DOE numbers in general? And would love to get some color there. And also on the supply outlook on the product side, just given the multiple variables at play, be it Russian products rerouting ahead of the February 5 new ban or incremental Asian exports in China and ex-China potentially coming to water and hitting PADD 5 and would love to hear your views on how all of that percolates.\nMichael Hennigan: Theresa, I'll start off with mine. My comments were related to the DOE data, but I'll let Brian give a little color on our specific data. But just in general, I think it's consistent that we still see a lot of demand recovery, and that's why we're so bullish at this point, and then we'll take the second part of your question in a second.\nBrian Partee: Yes, thanks, Theresa, for the question. So yes, just a bit of color maybe on the system. First, to address Mike's comments around our data. Mike did quote on the DOE data. Our comps back to 2019 aren't super relevant given that we've shut down a couple of different refineries, we sold off for retail units. So we really look at the year-to-year. And I'll give you just a high-level overview for Q3. So year-on-year, distillate has been steady and strong, very stable across the platform and really flat year-on-year. Jet continues to perform well, and we're seeing that recover year-on-year about 6%, but still below 2019 across the platform. And then gasoline is probably the most interesting. We did -- we were off slightly from 2021 in Q3, about 2% and it really correlates to retail prices. So we'll start in the West and about 4% below Q1 and 2021 out West, so 4% decline that we really correlate directly to retail prices and the elasticity impact of higher retails. Midwest was about 3% and the Gulf Coast was 1%. So overall, about 2%. But kind of going back to Mike's earlier comments, we do remain optimistic as we think about demand. I mentioned October we came out of the chute really strong here for Q4. We're continuing to see COVID demand recovery. Jet travel more broadly, the halo around activity and vacations, not just Jet but marine fuel, diesel, gasoline, et cetera. And we also have moderated retail prices coming off of the summer highs. We're currently around $375 a gallon, well off of our highs in the summer. And demand continues to also be robust in South America and the Caribbean. The economies there are geared a little bit differently. We've got strong agricultural demand globally as well as mining activity. There's been some price subsidization that's occurred in South of the border here, that's also helped to prop up demand. So -- and then we're seeing pulls into Europe as well, for obvious reasons, primarily around energy security and just having access to the fuel going forward as the winter enthuse here. And the last thing I'd mention is on the supply constraint side. We've taken a lot of capacity offline globally, and we do expect a degree of friction around the Russian exports of production, hard to call the ball on how impactful that might be. Everybody is watching very closely, but we don't expect it to be positive for incremental supply. We do expect it to drag just a bit.\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm sorry, the Asian export or potential exports?\nBrian Partee: Yes, as it relates to a lot of -- and you enter a rumor coming out of Asia in terms of export quotas, COVID policies, really difficult for us to call. The one data point I can give you, though, Theresa, empirically on that, is we have not seen where we compete. We have not seen a step change in terms of competing with refineries coming out of Asia, specifically to China. Just it's been steady as she goes, status quo here for the last several months.\nMichael Hennigan: Theresa, it's Mike. I would just add that the inventories are obviously low. The market needs additional barrels. We're doing our best to put out as much product as we can. Brian mentioned the point about we see some price elasticity when prices get too high. So I think at the end of the day, we spend as much time on what we control, and that's to run as hard as we can, put as much product into the market as we can. And whether Asia -- exports come or don't come, the market needs to supply. So I think that's why, at the end of the day, we still see this to be a pretty bullish outlook. It's just -- it's evolved over a couple of years. We think demand is going to continue to come back. Brian just gave you some specifics on our areas. I had mentioned the DOE stuff. So we believe that demand will continue to recover and then whether supply comes from China or from the U.S. market itself is the market just needs it. It's a supply-constrained recovering demand outlook that makes us have this bullish look.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Matthew Blair with TPH. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nMatthew Blair: Hey, good morning and Mike, congrats on your good health news from last month, it's great to hear. I had a question on the -- I had a question on the STAR project, which you mentioned will be complete in early 2023. I think at one point, you were hoping for about $525 million of EBITDA from the project. Has that number moved up with your expectations of a higher mid-cycle environment? And if so, could you give us a range on what that might look like? And then in terms of just how it will flow through the financials, I believe it will add 40,000 barrels a day of new refining capacity, so we should expect a volume kick but then also a margin improvement, right, from the ability to handle residuals better. And I think there might be some octane benefits too. So if you could walk through that, that would be great.\nTimothy Aydt: Hey Matt, this is Tim. I'll take the first part of that question. So the remaining scope that we have will indeed increase the heavy crude capacity by about 40,000 barrels a day. It will also improve the resid upgrading by about 17,000 a day. We do still feel really good about the economic drivers of the project. I mean, obviously, you've got the current widening heavy crude differentials and you've got strong distillate cracks that have really kind of improved the project value over our original look. We also made some logistics investments that are being heavily utilized and those further improved product margins in some of these niche markets, be it domestic or foreign and then as I said in the prepared remarks, so the remaining work is going to be tied in during the turnaround in the first quarter of next year. So that's kind of where we're at on the STAR project. So kind of back over to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan: Matt, you can just -- whatever numbers you want to put on, you had it right from the beginning. It's 40,000 barrels a day of additional crude times whatever number you want to put on that and 17,000 barrels a day of heavy upgrading. So whatever your outlook is, that's the math that will give you the additional EBITDA once we start this up.\nMatthew Blair: Good stuff. Thanks. I'll leave it there.\nMichael Hennigan: You're welcome.\nKristina Kazarian: Sounds great there. And then on that operator, I think we are done for today. So thank you, everyone, for your interest in Marathon Petroleum. Should you have any additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed today, please reach out and our IR team will be available to help you with your questions. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you so much. That will conclude today's conference, and we thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Brian Partee",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. Yes, Neil, just great question. I appreciate the opportunity to kind of weigh in here. And Rick said it, but I'll double down on it. It's about one or two things. It's literally everything. We've changed. We've moved mountains and really proud of the work that the team has done. There's been a lot of progress, as Mike alluded to in his comments, there's more to get. I think foundationally, as we look going forward, one of the key components is our digital transformation that underpins a lot of the efforts we have on the commercial front. And we think leveraging our scale across our coast-to-coast platform provides us a distinct opportunity set as it relates to that digital evolution in our space. The other thing I'd say just real quick is what underpins all this? Or alignment changed everything. We fundamentally changed the organizational structure and realign people, we empowered people and we held them accountable. We have a people-centric business in the commercial space, and we're really leveraging that. And the core tenet of what we're trying to accomplish is to let our great people do great things. Yes, Roger, this is Brian Partee. I can take that. There's a couple of different things to unpack there. First on the Mississippi River. We have a really strong and capable Inland River system and team. We've got over 20 tugs and 300 barges. We largely operate on the Ohio River, but also do transit the Mississippi. And the team has been working extremely hard over the last several months making sure the product continues to flow. So I can say there's been no impact, but it's been on the heels of our team working very diligently hard and positioning the right equipment in the lower Mississippi River to make sure that we don't have disruptions. So on that front, things have been going pretty well. As it relates to the ongoing dialog with the administration, we have had frequent engagement and communication, which has been welcomed. I think it's good to share and understand each other's perspective. And as it relates to the export ban, I think that through the dialog, there's been general consensus and understanding that, that likely would be counterproductive the goals and objectives of building inventory and reducing prices. I mean, fundamentally, if you look at our 2.5 million barrels of exports in the U.S., we just don't have enough demand to back it in. We've got grade mixes. We've got logistics disconnect. So I think there's been broad understanding and engagement that, that's not the best course of action. Now all that being said, I just can't speak on behalf of the administration, I think anything is on the table at any time. Yes, thanks, Rick. Just one quick summary wrap-up comment. It's hard to call the ball one month into the quarter, but I will say that October from a clean products perspective, started off strong, as Mike indicated in his opening commentary, we did not see the seasonal turndown in demand. We've had weather working largely in our favor. We haven't had a Hurricane event in the country as a whole has been pretty moderate on the weather front. We did see -- we've seen strong demand throughout the month of October. And correspondingly, we've seen strong margins as well. So directionally, I think, favorable but too early to call the ball. You're welcome. Good morning, Sam. Yes, Sam, this is Brian. I'll take that question. It's a great question. So, first, let me just back up and talk a little bit about what we have going on out west with Martinez. So we're well into our prefill strategy. So we've been prefielding since middle of the summer. We're currently buying from over 50 different suppliers. So we forayed into this business two years ago with Dickinson and the team has come up very, very fast in developing those relationships. Yes, Paul, thanks. This is Brian. I understand the question. So first on CI as it relates to soybean oil, UCO and actually even some of the other feedstocks that we look at. I would say that we're at a point or we've been at a point here in the last several months where we like ourselves and others have been in startup mode. So there's been a bit of a surge in demand in acquiring feedstocks as it relates to start-up. And the market broadly is not super-efficient yet. So it's an emerging market. Relationships matter. A lot of the sellers in this space, so whether it's UCO or rendered fats. It's a new business line for them. So there's a lot of exploration ongoing. So I don't think it's a structural change as we've seen here in the last couple of months. But I do think it's just the nature of the market evolving from a CI perspective. But as I said earlier, to Sam's question, I think logistics are going to be key. Those relationships are going to be key to make sure we get the right feedstocks, the most advantaged feedstocks into our facilities. Your second question related to LCFS. Certainly, we've seen the supply and demand of LCFS credits to gap out here over the last 1.5 years or so. The one point I'd make here is we're seeing that in California, that there's other states, other areas, Canada, Oregon that have emerging programs. So that's a new variable that's entering into the equation and calculus for us and others in terms of where you actually place the product. So we reported -- CARB reported a pretty big build for the second quarter. Credit is still a little over 1.3 million credit in the second quarter. So that surplus continues to grow.

Feedstock pricing, although stable through the third quarter has been towards the higher side as we think about this year. And then as you mentioned, the LCFS have been the lower side. But all that combined considered, we're seeing stable margin production out of our Dickinson facility, and we'd expect the same out in Martinez, just through a variety of different variables. Yes, thanks, Theresa, for the question. So yes, just a bit of color maybe on the system. First, to address Mike's comments around our data. Mike did quote on the DOE data.

            "name": "Michael Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to introduce Tim Aydt, who will be joining our call as a new Executive Vice President of Refining. Tim has over 37 years of experience in leadership roles across our midstream and refining organizations. Most recently, he was Executive Vice President of Pipelines, Terminals and Marine and Chief Commercial Officer, where he oversaw the business development for the MLP. Now turning to the macro environment. Roughly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity has come offline globally in the last couple of years. Yet demand for the transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust and continues to grow. In the U.S., demand is still below 2019 pre-COVID levels, and we believe there will be a continued recovery. As supply remains constrained and demand continues to rebound, we maintain a bullish outlook towards the refining environment as we look into 2023. Our third quarter results reflect the team's operational and commercial execution as we focused on delivering products for consumers in this very tight market. In our Refining segment, we ran near full rates while maintaining our steadfast commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. The commercial team focused on optimizing our scale, footprint and feedstock slate to deliver against strong demand. And despite volatility in the global energy markets, our execution reflects progress towards our goal of improving commercial performance. We normally see seasonal demand decline at this time of the year but to date, we're not seeing those signs. Strong forward crack spreads and wide salary differentials for 2023 indicate the expectation of a strong refining environment going forward. In the fourth quarter, we're currently running our system at full utilization, except for the planned maintenance activity we have occurring given our back of the year weighted turnaround schedule. Aside from the Refining business, I want to point out that our Midstream segment earnings continue to grow. In the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 9% year-over-year in midstream. We've been executing strategic capital investments, fostering a low-cost culture and optimizing the portfolio, including advancing several organic growth projects in the Permian Basin. The strength of these cash flows supports MPLX's decision to increase its quarterly distribution by 10%. Based on this level, MPC will receive $2 billion of distribution from MPLX annually. We've received questions regarding the structure of MPLX and whether MPC will acquire the outstanding public unit. So we want to restate what we said in the past. MPLX is a strategic part of MPC's portfolio, its current pace of cash distributions to MPC is $2 billion per year, and we expect that to continue growing. MPLX has continued to demonstrate resilient through-cycle earnings and growing cash flows. As MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic partnership will continue to be enhanced, and we do not plan to roll up MPLX. Switching to capital allocation, we believe MPC's current capital allocation priorities are optimal for our shareholders. In October, we completed our $15 billion return of capital commitment, repurchasing approximately 30% of MPC's shares outstanding. We're committed to executing our capital allocation framework to deliver peer-leading total return to shareholders. Today, we announced an increase to MPC's quarterly dividend of approximately 30%. In addition, we intend to continue repurchases, which we believe are a more efficient way to return capital and we expect to commence buybacks in November using the remaining $5 billion repurchase authorization. In early 2000, we shared our three strategic areas of focus. They have become part of MPC's DNA embedded in our unwavering commitment to increase profitability, have the best through-cycle cash flow generation and drive a long-term value creation. As we focus on strengthening the competitive position of our assets, in September, we closed on our Martinez Renewables joint venture with Neste. Construction is well underway, and we expect Phase 1 mechanical completion by year-end. We're excited about the partnership with Neste, a global leader in feedstock procurement and renewable fuels production. This joint venture enhances the value of the project by reducing MPC's capital commitment to $0.55 per gallon as well as improving the overall project feedstock slate. Neste has the obligation to bring 80% advantaged feedstock in Phase 2. Due to these improvements, we expect MPC share in the JV's EBITDA to be only 25% lower than our original stand-alone case. Additionally, this strategic partnership with Neste creates a platform for collaboration. We believe there will be opportunities to leverage the differentiated knowledge and capabilities of two industry leaders as we pursue our shared commitment to the energy evolution. We continue to challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy and have made progress on the sustainability goals that we have set for ourselves. Focusing specifically on the Martinez Renewables project which converts our petroleum refinery into a renewable fuels facility. We anticipate the conversion to result in a 60% reduction of the facility's Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, 70% lower total criteria air pollutants and 1 billion gallons of water saved annually. If you haven't had a chance yet, we invite you to go to the Sustainability section of our website and learn more about the ways we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann. And Doug, it's Mike. I'll add to Maryann's comments. So what I said in the prepared remarks is the fundamentals of the business have changed as a result of what's happened over the last couple of years -- roughly 4 million barrels of refining capacity has come out of the market. At a time early on when demand was down, but demand continues to recover. We're still not at 2019 levels of demand across all the products, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel. So we're still below, but we are slowly recovering. So you have supply constrained, you got demand recovering. And to your point, the mid-cycle that we see into the future is clearly above the previous mid-cycle because the global fundamentals have changed. And as we look out in time, there are going to be some capacity additions occurring throughout the world, but we also believe that demand is going to continue to pace such that the new mid-cycle for what we're going to see is significantly above where we've been in the past. So that's obviously why we have a bullish overtone here and why we still believe that the assets that we have are still trading under intrinsic value. Now I know you'd love us to give the exact number what we call internally. So I'm not going to do that, as you know but we stress tested. We stress tested in a low case, our view of a mid case and our view of a higher case. And as we look at all those things, we still believe fundamentally that we can purchase our shares at a price that's still adding value to our shareholders. So that's why we've been so aggressive in that area. We had committed to that return. As Maryann said in the prepared remarks, we bought back at a pretty good number, and we still see that as an ongoing opportunity. You also asked about the dividend. I mean our dividend being where it was, was mainly because of the equity price coming up. And we did feel it weren't an adjustment. People had asked us for several quarters in a row, whether we're going to do that. And we said we're going to do it after we do the $15 billion of Speedway. So hopefully, we were consistent with what we said there. We've moved it up as Maryann said, it's not a tax-efficient way to return to shareholders. But we want to have a competitive number as well. So 30% is a good bump. We'll keep an eye on that. And at the same time, we're going to continue to reduce the share count. Hopefully, that gives you a little more color. Yes. Thanks, Neil, for the question. I'm going to let Rick and Brian comment. But I'll -- before they do, I would say to you, we did say early on that we had three major areas that we're going to put emphasis on and we've made progress in the commercial area. We still see a lot more opportunity for us. So we're not done in that area, but we have made some progress. I'll let Rick and Brian give some comments. Good morning, Roger. Hey Roger, it's Mike. I'll just add to Brian, I'll give you my thoughts on it. Number one is I do think the administration understands that a ban would not have the effect that they were originally looking for and instead would decrease inventory levels, reduce refining capacity and actually put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices, which is not what they were intending. So I think given these potential outcomes, it's my opinion, that the administration would not pursue that path. But that's just -- that's my thought at this point. John, it's Mike. Let me just add to what Maryann just said. So we try our best to give you as good a guidance as we can with the one caveat being where is natural gas price going to be? So we look at the forward curve right before we give the guidance and just reminding you the sensitivity is $0.30 a barrel for every $1 per million BTUs. So where that actually ends up in the quarter is hard to call. So we just take a look at the forward curve ahead of time and put our best number on it. So what I feel good about is the areas that we control on cost. I continue to say we have sustainable reductions that we've seen over the last couple of years, and that's good. As Maryann mentioned, we have a tax dispute that we'll follow up on. And we have this unknown as to where natural gas will actually price itself throughout the whole quarter. Hopefully, that helps. Yes, before we pass to the other guys, John, I just want to remind everybody that when Q2 margins were as high as they were, we made a conscious decision to delay some activity into the back half of the year, specifically into the fourth quarter. At that time, we felt it was a good idea, provided there was no safety issues or anything to make that adjustment. So some of what's happened here is we've traded some Q2 margin for Q4 margin and we still think that was a good call, but it has loaded up a little bit more activity in the fourth quarter as far as our turnaround activity. Hi, Paul, it's Mike. I just want to add a comment. We've been talking about Martinez for a while now. And early on, we said that in order to have a terrific facility, we wanted to have competitive CapEx and I think everybody has seen our numbers on that. We've disclosed that. OpEx, we're in a really good position with the former refinery asset. Brian has talked about, we're pretty bullish to the logistics assets that we have set up here and the last piece of the puzzle was feedstocks that which you're asking about, and Brian just gave you some color on our side. Plus, I do want to reiterate, that was part of the driver for our partnership with Neste. We know their portfolio and see them as a global leader in this area. So it was one of the key factors that enabled us to say we wanted to JV with them. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we think there's more to come with the relationship with Neste. We're working on different things together as we feel that we've had a win-win for both sides of this but feedstock procurement is actually one of the most important parts of this and kind of the last leg of the stool after we talked about CapEx, OpEx and logistics. So hopefully, that helps. Yes. So we're not sure what you said. Kristina said, you thought you heard you say, are we adding alkeplants, did you say alke or? Okay. Understood it was RD. Yes. I think, Paul, it's more the latter. We have some things going. I'll let Dave make a few comments on some of the areas that we're looking at. But -- but we'll have Martinez started up here very shortly within a couple of months. We're going to mechanically complete at the end of the year. So it's probably a little more latter to the scenario that you played out but the whole area continues to evolve. So Dave, why don't you give a little color on some of the things that we're looking at. Theresa, I'll start off with mine. My comments were related to the DOE data, but I'll let Brian give a little color on our specific data. But just in general, I think it's consistent that we still see a lot of demand recovery, and that's why we're so bullish at this point, and then we'll take the second part of your question in a second. Theresa, it's Mike. I would just add that the inventories are obviously low. The market needs additional barrels. We're doing our best to put out as much product as we can. Brian mentioned the point about we see some price elasticity when prices get too high. So I think at the end of the day, we spend as much time on what we control, and that's to run as hard as we can, put as much product into the market as we can. And whether Asia -- exports come or don't come, the market needs to supply. So I think that's why, at the end of the day, we still see this to be a pretty bullish outlook. It's just -- it's evolved over a couple of years. We think demand is going to continue to come back. Brian just gave you some specifics on our areas. I had mentioned the DOE stuff. So we believe that demand will continue to recover and then whether supply comes from China or from the U.S. market itself is the market just needs it. It's a supply-constrained recovering demand outlook that makes us have this bullish look. Matt, you can just -- whatever numbers you want to put on, you had it right from the beginning. It's 40,000 barrels a day of additional crude times whatever number you want to put on that and 17,000 barrels a day of heavy upgrading. So whatever your outlook is, that's the math that will give you the additional EBITDA once we start this up. You're welcome."

            "content": "Hey Matt, this is Tim. I'll take the first part of that question. So the remaining scope that we have will indeed increase the heavy crude capacity by about 40,000 barrels a day. It will also improve the resid upgrading by about 17,000 a day. We do still feel really good about the economic drivers of the project. I mean, obviously, you've got the current widening heavy crude differentials and you've got strong distillate cracks that have really kind of improved the project value over our original look. We also made some logistics investments that are being heavily utilized and those further improved product margins in some of these niche markets, be it domestic or foreign and then as I said in the prepared remarks, so the remaining work is going to be tied in during the turnaround in the first quarter of next year. So that's kind of where we're at on the STAR project. So kind of back over to Mike."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Moving to third quarter results. Slide 6 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.81. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude three items: a $549 million noncash pretax gain related to the contribution of our refining assets to the Martinez Renewables JV, a $509 million noncash gain related to an MPLX third-party contract reclassification and a $28 million LIFO inventory charge. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.8 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes was just under $4.5 billion. During the quarter, we returned $285 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $3.9 billion of our shares. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.3 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing as the blended crack spread was down approximately $10 per barrel, reflecting a 25% quarterly decline. The tax rate for the third quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of $1.4 billion. The tax rate is similar to last quarter due to the Refining & Marketing representing a larger component of total earnings. Moving to our segment slide results. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. During the quarter, we focused on supplying transportation fuels to meet continued strong market demand. Our Refining assets ran at 98% utilization processing over 2.8 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. We saw margins decline sequentially across all three regions. Capture was 97%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team in a volatile global market. Operating expenses were higher in the third quarter. Energy costs were approximately $0.15 per barrel higher in the third quarter, driven by higher natural gas prices. Additionally, we recorded a nonrecurring multiyear property tax assessment of $0.13 per barrel in the third quarter, which we will continue to pursue recovery. We believe the actions we have taken to bring our structural operating cost down to approximately $5 per barrel are sustainable. The cost increases we have seen year-to-date have almost entirely been driven by higher energy costs. Turning to Slide 9, which provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter. Market backwardation remained a headwind for the industry but our commercial strategy of selling ahead of product backwardation while keeping inventories optimized, supported our ability to meet demand and capture strong prompt margins. And while not as significant as the previous quarter, secondary product prices were a headwind as they lagged higher light product prices. Our ability to capture 97% of the market indicator across an incredibly volatile three months was in part due to our commercial responses. Slide 10 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the second quarter of 2022, our Midstream segment demonstrated earnings growth with adjusted EBITDA up approximately 3% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. Overall, we continue to focus on identifying and efficiently executing high-return projects to drive further growth for our midstream business. As Mike mentioned earlier, the growth of MPLX's earnings supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by 10% to $0.775 per share and MPC expects to receive $2 billion in cash from MPLX on an annual basis. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and as MPLX grows its free cash flow we believe it will have the capacity to return capital to its unitholders. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter, operating cash flow excluding changes in working capital, was just under $4.5 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $1.9 billion headwind for the quarter. This quarter, we made a payment of $2.3 billion for estimated federal income taxes declining crude prices or also a headwind to working capital. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $756 million this quarter. The increased level of capital spending was related to a ramp in activity related to the Martinez Renewables fuels facility conversion and the Galveston Bay store project. The STAR project is expected to be completed early 2023. Other cash flow benefits of $790 million is primarily driven by the distribution MPC receipt from the Martinez Renewables JV upon closing on September 21. At the end of the third quarter, MPC had approximately $11.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Moving to Slide 12. We have completed our $15 billion share repurchase commitment, utilizing the proceeds from the Speedway divestiture at an average price of $78, ahead of our commitment of no later than the end of 2022. As you will see today, when our quarterly financials, the 10-Q was published, we were able to complete that early in the month of October. We intend to begin repurchase against our $5 billion outstanding authorization in November, now that our financials are public. On Slide 13, I'd like to walk you through our financial priorities, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. We're committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We believe the quarterly increase to $0.75 per share we announced today is secured through cycles, competitive with peers and the broader market and leaves opportunity to potentially grow our dividend in the future. We anticipate this dividend will be supplemented with repurchases and we are committed to executing our capital allocation framework to deliver peer-leading total returns to shareholders. We will evaluate growth opportunities and margin enhancing projects. Share repurchases will be used to return excess capital to shareholders, which we believe are a more efficient way to return capital and will continue to lower our share count. Underpinning these priorities, we believe a strong balance sheet is essential to being successful in a competitive commodity business. It's the foundation, allowing us to execute our strategy. On Slide 14, we highlight the strength of MPC's balance sheet. We continue to manage our balance sheet through an investment-grade credit profile. At the end of our third quarter, MPC stand-alone gross debt to capital ratio is 21% which is under our target of a 25% to 30% gross debt-to-capital ratio. MPLX has a leverage ratio of 3.5x debt to EBITDA under its target of 4x. Both businesses have strong balance sheet with leverage ratios under their respective targets. Turning to guidance on Slide 15, we provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day, representing 93% utilization. Utilization is forecast to be lower than third quarter due to planned turnaround activity having a higher impact on crude units in the fourth quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $430 million in the fourth quarter with a significant level of activity in the Gulf Coast region. Turnaround activity is reflected in our fourth quarter throughput guidance. We are expecting operating cost per barrel in the fourth quarter to be lower projected to be $5.30 per barrel for the quarter. This is primarily driven by expected lower natural gas and energy costs. As a reminder, natural gas has historically represented approximately 15% of operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity is approximately $330 million of annual EBITDA for every dollar change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. In closing, we will continue to execute on our three strategic pillars, strengthening the competitive performance of our assets, fostering a low-cost culture and improving our commercial performance. We are committed to position MPC as a reliable and efficient energy provider with new investments focused on high-return opportunities supporting the company's evolution, which will position it to lead in an energy diverse future. We will stay steadfast in our plan to position MPC as the refiner investment of choice, striving to deliver superior cash returns regardless of market conditions, and while ensuring we safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Let me turn the call back to Kristina. Thanks, Doug. So as you know, we made a commitment that we would reassess the dividend immediately completing the $15 billion, and we've done so. We wanted three objectives really around the dividend. One was for it to be secure competitive. And then obviously, with the potential to grow dividends in the future, as you said, we believe our increase to $0.75 in the quarter meets all three of those objectives. As you know, we completed that $15 billion share authorization and have a remaining $5 billion new authorization, which both Mike and I had shared on our prepared remarks that we intend to begin to use that very early in the month of November. We continue to think that our equity is undervalued. And when we look at distribution return on capital between dividend and share repurchase, we believe share repurchase remains a more efficient tool in that portfolio. So we'll look at market, we'll look at other growth opportunities, and we'll look at the macro, and we'll continue to use share repurchase absent other growth opportunities as the vehicle to continue to return capital to the shareholders and every decision that we make, obviously, focused on trying to ensure we've got peer-leading returns. I hope that helps, Doug. Doug, I'll start off, and I'm sure Mike will want to add incremental comment as well. I think the mid-cycle is an extremely difficult way for us to put a pin in as we stand right now. Certainly, when we look at the market dynamics, as Mike shared as well, we remain pretty bullish on the outlook, not only for the fourth quarter, but certainly as we head into 2023. So a series of factors that we use and we look at to determine when we say we believe that equity is undervalued, and we'll continue to be as opportunistic as we can as we are using share repurchase in evaluating where both the fourth and the first quarter will go and, frankly, longer term. So several factors that we consider, but we certainly look right now at a fairly optimistic outlook for the next several quarters. Sure, John. It's Maryann. So in the third quarter, we had really three things that were largely equally weighted, that impacted the actual results in the quarter. The first, as you mentioned, was -- I call it a one-time. We had about a $0.13 impact from a four-year adjustment on property tax costs. Unfortunately, the state has the ability to go back and do that. So that is non-repeating. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll go after that and continue to pursue it. But unfortunately, when it's live, we need to record it. So that was in the quarter. Second, obviously, higher energy costs just in general, quarter-over-quarter, as I mentioned. And then the last piece, to your point, in the third quarter, given the level of back half-weighted turnaround expenses or other activities associated with that or higher. When we gave guidance for the fourth quarter, we certainly see energy costs somewhat nat gas related decline in Q3 to Q4. And obviously, the tax impact, we do not expect to repeat. I hope that addresses the question. Hey John, Maryann, I'll start and then I'll pass it to Rick and Brian to give you any incremental color. But you're right, when I provided guidance on capture for the third quarter, knowing that we had a fairly strong third and fourth quarter, frankly, but third quarter compared to the second quarter turnaround activity, we expected that we would have seen some capture impact as a result. Having said that, there were certainly some offsetting elements in the quarter. First, as you know, we actually saw prices come down a bit and those lower prices actually improved our clean product margins. Pricing actually really did benefit as we looked at the volumetric gains quarter-over-quarter. And then while secondaries were still a headwind in the quarter, they were better than what we had initially projected. Your question was a little bit tough, you were cutting in and out. But as we talk about the fourth quarter, I think, is what you were asking as well. Obviously, it will be, as you've seen from the guidance, our heaviest turnaround month of all -- excuse me, quarter of all four quarters. So we would certainly anticipate that capture in the fourth quarter could be below what we saw in the third quarter for some of those very reasons. But let me pass it to Rick and Brian to give you incremental color. I think Mike wants it too."

            "name": "Rick Hessling",
            "content": "Yes, Neil, it's Rick. Thank you for the question. It's one of these items where we've been looking at the pull through, and we've been seeing it the last several quarters. So it's nice that you're noticing it as well. I would start by saying earlier this year, we changed a lot. We changed processes, we change structure and culture around all things commercial that's been a game changer for us. In terms of details and how competitively, I'll be careful in what I share here, Neil. But if you look at it over were through a broad lens, we've stood up a dedicated what we call VCO team, value chain optimization team that goes from end-to-end, from feedstocks to products from purchasing or procuring to placement and we're relooking at everything we do, the why, the how, all modeling constraints, assumptions, everything was put on the table and relooked at. And so a lot of change and great positive results have come out of that, especially in the midst of the environment we're in. So every win, when you're in an environment like we're in today is exemplified with the high crack and I think you're seeing that. In addition, you're seeing a lot of the re root of global products and feedstocks happening throughout the world. And through this initiative, we've been able to take advantage of a lot of purchasing of feedstock and the placement of our feed -- clean products in a time that has been highly advantageous. So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for more color on the clean side. Yes, hi Neil, it's Rick again. So great question. These markets are blowing out. We're seeing unprecedented levels again. On the heavy side, I think I looked this morning and I saw the forward curve. December was marked at minus 30, Q1, minus 27 and unbelievably stoked. 2023 Cal was 23 under, So what's driving it? Boy, it is a plethora of items. Production from the Canadian front, Neil, is pretty solid and we're entering right now blending season, as you know, the diluent blending season is slowing the pool, which is certainly helping as well. We've had some short-term shot in the arms with some maintenance in PADD 2, 3 and 5. When I say maintenance, unplanned maintenance, that's been a plug for us. And then fuel oil is really cheap. So you're seeing a lot of people substitute that for heavies in other parts of the world. So all of this is driving -- is really putting pressure on anything that hits the U.S. Gulf Coast. And lastly, I'll say, when you look at the Gulf of Mexico medium sour production, it's been healthy as well. So lately here, you're seeing Mars blow out. Certainly, you referenced the Canadians. So all of these items are stacking on top of one another and creating for a very bullish outlook here into 2023. In terms of MPC specifically, I think you are well aware, we have great access and optionality that we've built out our system over the years in PADD 2, PADD 3 and now PADD 5 and so we are going heavy. We're heavying up our slate. We're filling up our cokers as you would expect, and we'll continue to do so into Q3 as these indicators tell us to do so. You're welcome, Neil. John, this is Rick. I'll just add to Maryann's earlier comments and make a comment on secondary product margins. So we're one month into the quarter. We'll see where the next two months go. But secondary product margins have been so volatile and trying to predict where WTI is going to go from here is anyone's guess. I would say that's one of the biggest wildcards on where our capture will end up. So -- more to come there. We'll see how the rest of the quarter plays out. And with that, I'll see if Brian has any color to add. Yes, hi Sam, it's Rick. So the call out is outstanding, especially in these low NGL price environments we're in right now. So when you look at the logistics of combining MWE and MPC and our total footprint, it's incredible today, especially as we optimize our octane with NGLs and heading into the butane blending season. Really, to answer your question, it's yes and yes. Yes, we saw this coming to the extent it is here today. I would say it's -- it's certainly a nice shot in the arm for us as we optimize around our system, both from specifically butane and all things NGLs tied to our -- tied to our whole system. We're seeing specific benefits certainly on the Gulf Coast with Garyville, but it's throughout our entire system. So a great call out. You're welcome."

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian, Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investor tab.  Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team.  We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our SEC filings.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our operational activity was driven by strong market demand for transportation fuels we manufacture. Demand remains resilient, largely driven by the removal of globally imposed mobility restrictions and the pent-up desire to travel.  Jet fuel demand continued its recovery, up nearly 20% from the same quarter last year, with the increased resumption of travel. Gasoline demand remained very resilient through the quarter in part due to the start of the summer driving season. Diesel demand after a strong beginning to the year, softened a bit in the second quarter due to lower trucking volumes.  During the second quarter, in order to meet robust customer demand, we ran our refining system at full utilization. We optimized our system to provide as much transportation fuel to the market as possible. Commercially, we optimized around our scale, footprint and feedstock slate to meet this customer demand.  This resulted in an adjusted EBITDA of $9.1 billion as we saw crack spreads this quarter respond to uncertainty in the product markets, driven by the potential for sanction impacts on top of an already tight supply and related inventory levels.  Maryann will walk you through the details of our results. But looking forward, we expect tight supply, low inventory levels and strong global demand to continue to incentivize high refining runs into the third quarter. We will continue to execute on what we can control running a safe, reliable, low-cost system, improving our commercial performance and strengthening the competitive performance of our assets.  On capital allocation, we remain committed to the 4 priorities we previously outlined. First, we're going to take care of our assets by deploying maintenance capital. We want to ensure we can safely operate our assets protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.  Second, we're committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. And as we've stated in the past, once we complete the $15 billion capital return program that resulted from the Speedway sale, we will reassess the level of our dividend.  Third, we see this as a return on as well as the return of capital business. As we enter the second half of the year, our capital spending outlook remains on track.  We continue to progress our Martinez renewable fuels facility with the first phase of the facility currently targeted to be mechanically complete by year-end. Once completed, the facility is expected to be capable of bringing nearly 50,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel supply into the market.  We also expect to be able to close our JV with Neste in the coming months. The time frame for completing the facility and closing the JV are dependent upon the timing of obtaining the air quality permit. We'll continue to look for other opportunities to generate a return on capital such as cost reduction projects and opportunities that build out our competencies and increase our competitive advantages to drive returns and shareholder value.  And fourth, after executing against the first 3 objectives, we look to return capital to shareholders. In the 3 months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased $4.1 billion of shares. And today, we announced a separate and incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization.  At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Moving to our sustainability efforts. In June, we published our annual sustainability report and our annual perspective on climate scenarios report. We continue to make progress on our greenhouse gas reduction targets. And through 2021, we have achieved a 23% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 intensity emissions, and an 11% reduction in our absolute Scope 3, Category 11 greenhouse gas emissions.  Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios which is aligned with TCFD standards, provides insight into some of the strategic considerations we take to set meaningful objectives, dedicate resources to accomplish them and then hold ourselves accountable and demonstrate results. Our sustainability report shows continued progress on the sustainability goals that we have set for ourselves, which we have been reporting on since 2011. We believe our investors and other interested stakeholders will find that the extensive disclosures in these reports illustrate our company's financial strength, adaptiveness and resilience to climate-related risks.  Moving to second quarter results. Slide 5 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $10.61. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude a $230 million benefit related to changes in the 2020 and 2021 RVO requirements published by the EPA. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $9.1 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes was almost $7 billion.  During the quarter, we returned $313 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased approximately $3.3 billion of shares. Through the end of July, we have repurchased $4.1 billion of shares since our last earnings call.  Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA, and as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2022 to the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially and driven primarily by an approximately $6.4 billion increase from Refining & Marketing. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of $1.8 billion. The tax rate is higher this last quarter due to refining end marketing representing a larger component of earnings in the quarter.  Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. During the quarter, our R&M team was focused on supplying transportation fuels to meet market demand. Refining ran at 100% utilization processing approximately 2.9 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries safely and reliably. This is the same level of throughput achieved back in 2019 pre-pandemic before the closures of Gallup and Martinez.  Capture was 96%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team in a volatile market. Operating expenses were higher in the second quarter, driven primarily by natural gas prices, which were approximately $3 per MMBtu higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter.  While we have been able to mitigate some of the impact of higher prices, the cost increase we have seen in the first half of the year has been almost entirely driven by higher energy cost. We continue to believe the cost reductions we made to bring our structural operating costs down to approximately $5 per barrel are sustainable. With higher natural gas prices, we would expect operating costs to remain elevated in the third quarter. Distribution costs were modestly higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter due to higher refinery utilization, which resulted in higher system volumes.  Turning to Slide 8, which provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter, our capture results this quarter were impacted by a few key factors. Secondary products continue to be a headwind as prices lag higher light product prices. This was partially offset by strong gasoline and distillate margins as well as higher volumetric gain due to higher product prices.  Product backwardation created a headwind during part of the quarter. But during this time, we were able to leverage our robust logistics capabilities to translate a portion of our physical barrels into the market on a more prompt basis. And our ability to capture 96% of the market indicator across an incredibly volatile 3 months was in part due to our commercial responses.  Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Performance is underpinned by strong operations and a commitment to strict capital discipline.  MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio. As MPLX continues to generate free cash flow, we believe it will have the capacity to return significant capital to its unitholders. Today, MPLX announced an incremental $1 billion unit repurchase authorization.  Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $7 billion in the quarter, which excludes changes in working capital. Working capital was roughly flat for the quarter as we saw benefits from an increase in crude oil payables related to higher refining throughput, offset by a build in crude oil inventories. Since the first quarter of 2021, working capital related to increasing prices has been a source of cash flow.  Capital expenditures and investments totaled $546 million this quarter. We continue to spend on our STAR project, which is projected to increase crude capacity at the Galveston Bay refinery by 40,000 barrels per day. This project is expected to be completed early 2023. We are progressing the conversion of Martinez renewable fuel facility and expect the first phase to be mechanically complete by year-end.  During the quarter, MPC returned $313 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $3.3 billion worth of shares. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $13.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.  As Mike mentioned earlier, we remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Our objective has been to complete the $15 billion repurchase program no later than the end of this year. We remain on track to meet this commitment. Upon completion of the program, we will reassess our dividend level.  Since the launch of this program in May 2021, we have repurchased approximately 12.1 billion shares at an average share price of approximately $74 per share. Over this time, we have reduced MPC share count by approximately 162 million shares or over 24%. We've received the Board's approval for a separate and incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We'll work through our capital allocation priorities and continue to assess the market environment to determine how we might execute against this authorization.  Turning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our third quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day representing 94% utilization. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than second quarter due to higher planned turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $400 million in the third quarter with activity spread across all 3 regions.  As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, our planned turnaround activity is back half weighted for 2022. Turnaround activity is reflected in our third quarter throughput guidance we expect this elevated level of activity may reduce our light product yields. We'll optimize to minimize the impacts, but we think our capture rate for the third quarter could be lower than the second quarter.  In coordinating maintenance work, we'll always try to maximize turnaround and catalyst cycles to the economic optimum, but we also do not compromise on safety or asset integrity and ensure work is scheduled to achieve this balance Total operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel for the quarter. We are expecting higher operating costs in the third quarter. This is primarily driven by the elevated cost of natural gas as well as slightly higher project expense work, which we normally coordinate to occur during turnarounds to limit the impact on throughput reduction.  As a reminder, natural gas has historically represented approximately 15% of operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity of approximately $330 million of annual EBITDA for every $1 change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost.  Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the third quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area.  In closing, we will continue to optimize our system to provide as much transportation fuel to the market as demand requires. We remain committed to advancing our low-cost initiatives and focused on areas to drive continued commercial outperformance, and we will stay steadfast in our plan to execute against our capital allocation priorities to drive shareholder value.  Let me turn the call back to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we're ready for the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Mike, nice to see you back. I guess, Mike, in the last couple of months, we've seen Shell and PBF to restructure the ownership of their MLP. Obviously, the relative yields remain very wide between yourselves and MPLX. I know I've asked you about this before, but I just wonder if there's been any reconsideration as to be appropriate, now that you've come through the buyback more or less the appropriate ownership structure of MPLX?\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Doug, we have talked about this before. I mean we continue to look at it. It's not something that we have off the radar screen. But we continue to come to the same conclusion we have for quite some time that those other situations where people are rolling up their MLPs, we think, are in a much different situation than we are. We're pretty pleased with our MLP's performance, continues to kick cash back to MPC. The structure itself, obviously, it's going out of favor with investors for a little bit, but we think that's starting to turn around as well.  So it's something we keep looking at, Doug. But at the end of the day, we're still comfortable with the structure that we have. And we think it works for the Marathon family to have both MPC and MPLX.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. I apologize. I now unpredictable, but I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that. So thank you. My follow-up is kind of related, I guess, Mike. I mean the operational reliability that you guys demonstrated in some of your peers also, but to be able to take advantage of the environment, I think, speaks to the way you're running the business, which really gets to the issue then of a sustainable base dividend, which you haven't increased since 2020.  Now I understand the point about you wanted to get the Speedway proceeds redeployed. But today, your dividend is, I guess, about 2/3 of the distribution you get from MPLX, which basically means MPC free cash flow isn't paying the dividend at all. So I just wonder if you can give us a steer as to what you think about the right level of base dividend as a proportion? However you want to measure it consolidated cash flow or however you want to look at it? But it seems the base dividend relative to the earnings part of the business is quite dislocated, if you like. I'll leave it at that.\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Doug, it's a good question. And I know some people have been asking us on the last couple of calls where we are on the dividend. I think if I'm right or if I'm wrong, we stated that we were going to maximize the share buyback program and complete that and then reset the dividend. That's still our intention. We're $12 billion through the $15 billion program. Everybody has seen the pace at which we can execute and that's guided by our trading volume and the programs that we have in place.  So we're pretty close to talking about that in a more constructive way, we are committed, and we said this in our remarks, we're committed to a competitive dividend. We want to show the market that we'll grow that dividend. It's probably taken a little longer than everybody's patience has been as far as this return program, but it's actually been executing well in our mind.  As Maryann said in the prepared remarks, we bought back quite a bit of the shares at $74. So we're feeling pretty good about that in general. And we're not too far off of the releasing to the market where our head is on the dividend.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Really terrific execution this quarter. The first question I had was actually on the crude market. It's obviously been volatile. But we've seen differentials widen out for a couple of different basins, Brent-WTI, Western Canadian crude has opened up as well. Just love your perspective from a commercial perspective of what do you think is driving some of the opening of the differentials? And do you see yourselves as well positioned to capture some of that volatility?\nMichael Hennigan: Good question, Neil. Let me let Rick take that.\nRick Hessling: Yes, Neil, really great question because we are seeing a lot of volatility in both of those markets, specifically to TI first. We're seeing strong production in the Permian and both on the WTI and WTL specifically. So if you look at where MPC is positioned and with our pipeline commitments with Galveston Bay really sitting in the backyard of the Permian. There's really nobody better positioned than us to take advantage of TI and TL. And then specifically on WCS, that has widened out to 21-plus under. And that's happening, Neil, for a variety of reasons. One, we believe the SPR barrels have put significant pressure on the medium sour barrels in the Gulf Coast, and WCS needs to clear to the Gulf Coast. So it needs to compete directly with the medium sour barrel, and the early SPR releases were predominantly medium sour. So from an MPC perspective, we have historical space out of Canada. We're able to take advantage of that in all 3 regions, the West Coast, the Mid-Con and now the Gulf Coast. So we feel very good about that macro environment going forward. If those are still open, we'll be as well positioned as anyone to capture those advantages.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. That's great color. And the follow-up is your views on renewable diesel. We've seen soy bean oil and vegetable oil has come off a little bit. And now there's talk of an extension of the blenders tax credit. LCFS, however, has come down. So can you talk about all the moving pieces that go into the economics of Rodeo and how that ties back into your view of the profitability of that asset?\nRaymond Brooks: Okay. Neil, this is Ray Brooks, and I'll take your question on that. You're right. There are a lot of moving parts to the economics of renewable diesel some recent headwinds, LCFS price is a little lower than we would have anticipated feedstock prices across the board a little higher. And then there's some tailwinds. We've got a bigger contribution from RIN pricing, a bigger contribution from RD prices. So a lot of moving pieces in the equation. But one thing I'll tell you is when we look at like our Dickinson project, when you take all the puts and takes, the plus and minuses together, we're pretty much on par with where we expected the project to come in. And so that's our experience with Dickinson. We expect the same type of contribution with Martinez going forward. One thing that I would like to add, though, is what we really do is a lot of things I'm talking about outside of our control, whether the regulatory prices, the feedstock price is going to be. I'd really like to focus on what we do and specific to Dickinson, we pay attention to all the feedstocks and we pivoted to the most lowest cost feedstock slate, the lowest carbon intensity slate by optimizing our feedstock acquisition process. The other thing we did is even though that, that project was supposed to be 100% refined bleach deodorized soybean oil, we used our pretreatment facilities at Beatrice, Nebraska and Cincinnati to essentially bring in a fully pretreated feed slate in there. So really concentrate on the things that we can control to deliver the EBITDA. But a lot of moving parts, and we're just doing the best we can with it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: Mike, you bought a lot of capital discipline to MPC. Investors really respect you for that. But we are in a different environment versus when you actually took over MPC. You have the best-in-class midstream footprint in Permian and Northeast, 2 basins where volumes are actually growing materially. We are seeing E&Ps raise CapEx in these regions. My question is for the right opportunity, organic or inorganic, would you be willing to spend more at the midstream level to benefit from the projected volume growth? .\nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Manav. I think the answer to that is yes. I mean, obviously, we probably would prefer to do that at the MPLX level as opposed to MPC. But we are definitely looking and trying to figure out ways to create value in both of those basins. I mean, as everybody knows, we've said for quite some time that we're going to concentrate in the Permian and concentrate in the Marcellus area. We did announce on the call earlier today that we are advancing a couple more processing plants, one up in the Marcellus, which has been kind of a constrained area for a little bit of time now and it looks like growth is going to start to pick up there. And then we've also announced another plant down in the Permian as well. So yes, we're very attentive. Hopefully, we'll find more opportunities in both of those basins because we think they're both going to continue to grow. I mean everybody is very aware of the global natural gas situation. We remain constructive on it, and we're trying to be as involved in that growth as we can be.\nManav Gupta: My second and very quick follow-up is, again, very positive operating cost on the Gulf Coast below $4. You -- if you look at last couple of years, it's been trending down, but you actually did not close an unprofitable assets. Sometimes when you close an unprofitable asset, the cost can come down. Your cost has been coming down as the assets -- as the number of assets has remained the same. So help us understand how you're able to push through these lower OpEx numbers?\nRaymond Brooks: Okay. Manav, this is Ray Brooks, and I'll take that question. I think it comes down to a couple of things. One is definitely paying attention to cost control striving to be the low cost, safe, reliable operator. And then the other key word is reliability. So when we look at the Gulf Coast for the second quarter, we ran extremely well, 1.35 million barrels a day of throughput in those 2 assets at Garyville and Galveston Bay. So best ever performance there out of those assets and they're phenomenal assets. And then the other thing is it's just concentrating on costs. We talked about this many times over the earnings calls in the last couple of years. We've got 2 refineries there that performed very well in the Solomon OpEx survey that comes out every 2 years. Garyville, historically, has been a very good first quartile refinery and Galveston Bay has improved over the past couple of years. So just strict cost discipline after we pay attention to all of our safety and maintenance cap just questioning everything we're spending there and running reliable. So even though your question was on cost in the Gulf Coast, we're really happy with 2Q with our margin performance. So I'm going to let Rick talk a little bit on that.\nRick Hessling: Yes. So Manav, so hand-in-hand with op costs goes refining margin per barrel. And we have really taken Mike's push on improving the commercial performance. We have an acronym we call CCI, continual commercial improvement, and the Gulf Coast -- and this is -- this goes for all 3 regions, but the Gulf Coast specifically, I think you're continuing to see us separate ourselves and improve quarter-to-quarter. And in simple terms, Manav, what we're doing is we are expanding the crack. We are expanding the margin from feedstocks to products. We're optimizing every day. It's a focus that is relentless within our team, and it's something truly that's been going on for years, but you're now really seeing the dividends of the optionality that the team has created, the logistical flexibility and our ability to take a feedstock into the refinery for raise team, his successful operating metrics that he's shown and proven that he's best in industry for quite some time with his toolkit.  And then taking that all the way to the end consumer, I can't stress enough how proud we are of our team and it's an initiative that's very important to us and one that I think you'll continually -- I'll ask you to continually watch because I feel confident in our performance in the quarters ahead as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes. Mike, good to hear you on the call, for sure. My question, coming back to the 96% capture in the quarter, your comments about the commercial operations helping. And then looking at where we are thus far in the third quarter. In Q2, we saw between the Gulf Coast and New York Harbor, quite an opening between cash markets for diesel. This quarter, it's cash markets for gasoline. So as we think about those kind of dislocations in the market, the crude diffs mentioned before, what would be a reasonable expectation for kind of capture performance this quarter?\nRick Hessling: This is Rick. So I'll take capture first. And I'll pivot back to -- before I specifically address your question, pivot back to Manav's point, one of the reasons you're seeing our capture where it's at is optionality. So optionality within our system really directly to your point, whether it's the Harbor or the Gulf Coast that blows out on diesel and gas, we are structuring our entire system to have optionality. We don't know when and where the differentials will blow out what will be favored 1 month versus the next. What I can tell you is when it happens, we have the system to take advantage of it. And that's years and years of really preparing for optionality within the system. Specifically, to your question on the Harbor versus the Gulf Coast, that's a tough call. It appears right now, as you said, gas is in favor. Where that will go will be interesting. I think part of that will be on inventories, how they play out within each of the regions as well as demand.  And from a demand perspective, we are seeing very bullish signals from the consumer right now. So we are quite optimistic on that front.\nRoger Read: Okay. And then maybe pivoting back to Martinez and the error permit that's still required. Could you just help us, I mean, the 30 days obviously was provided in the release. But is there any other part of that process we need to watch in terms of other approvals required or an extension or anything like that? I mean is it 30 days and should be good on knowing what to do? Or do we have to watch other events?\nRaymond Brooks: Roger, this is Ray. And I'll give you an update on Martinez. And I'll go back to the beginning of second quarter. On May 3, we were pretty excited when we got the EIR, the environmental impact report, the final one approved by Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors. So that was big and that let us with one more permit, which was the air permit with Bay Area Air Quality Management District. And so they spent the next couple of months doing a technical review and actually recently, July 22, they posted that permit for public comment, which is a 30-day comment period, which would end in August 21. So when that public comment period ends, they, along with us, providing input, will respond to any comments, and that should be the end. So what -- getting the air permit will be big deal. That allows us to start to unit up when it's ready, and it also allows us to close our joint venture partnership with Neste. So where would we see the light at the end of the tunnel coming on that one.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: So you touched on demand a bit in your opener and it sounds very strong. But I think if I'm not mistaken, I think the commentary related to 2Q. So it'd be interesting to hear what you're seeing in your system today on the demand side? And then maybe where you think we sit currently relative to pre-COVID? And anything on your outlook for the rest of the summer would be really helpful.\nRick Hessling: John, this is Rick. So going forward, it's been interesting. I'll back up and just talk about July and then where we're at today. So early in July, we had a little bit of a speed bump in and then around the 4th of July where demand was slightly below where we thought it should be. Ever since then, though, we've seen week-on-week increases and demand is picking up really across the board, but specifically in gasoline, diesel steady. And as Mike said in his opening comments around jet. Jet is 20% over quarter-on-quarter 2Q, anyways of -- from where we were a year ago, and we're getting very strong indicators from the airlines and the travel industry on domestic travel via jet. Specifically, going forward, we're seeing a very resilient consumer with a lot of pent-up demand and the trends look very promising. Now certainly, you have the headwinds of inflation, rising interest rates, et cetera. But right now, I would say the falling street price that has been permeated by the falling WTI market is winning the day. And the consumer is showing us very positive demand signals today, and we view that going forward as well.\nJohn Royall: Great. That's really helpful. And then on utilizations, you did 100% in 2Q, 3Q guidance is 94%. Just wondering on sequencing, you obviously ran full out for the entirety of 2Q. Is the expectation of 3Q that you'll run full out in July and August and then go into some maintenance in September? Is there any work plan for the summer? Just any thoughts on the sequencing for utilizations?\nRaymond Brooks: Yes. This is Ray again. So I'll take that question, John. Yes, you're right. We ran at 100% utilization in 2Q. And then in the third quarter, we're guiding to 94% utilization. And if you look at our turnaround number, up $400 million. That's because we have more turnaround plus catalyst work that's -- that we'll be doing in this 3-month period. One thing I'd like to highlight, though, is one of the reasons we ran 100% in 2Q is we really wanted to meet market demand. And so we challenge ourselves to what we could do in that regard. And just 1 example, we had 1 unit at one of our plants where a hydrocracker, we could squeeze a little bit more life out of the catalyst. And so we made a conscious decision to run through that in 2Q and do pick that work up in 3Q.  So we made those decisions. It looks like they're the right thing to do, but we do have a little bit more work coming up in the third quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.\nConnor Lynagh: I wanted to ask two on capital allocation here. The first is a bit of a housekeeping question on the buyback. Just so we're understanding this cadence that you're buying back stock in the second quarter here. Is the way to think about this that you're going to continue that until the end of the initial $15 billion, and you'll revisit from there? How should we think about the timing and pacing of the $5 billion buyback?\nMaryann Mannen: Connor, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. So I think you captured it right. As we said, we are committed to completing that $15 billion no later than this year -- at the end of this year, excuse me. And you can see by the pace that we have been executing that clearly in the quarter as well, $3.3 billion in the quarter, $4.1 billion since the last time we met on the earnings call, we remain committed and on track to deliver that. As we talk about the additional $5 billion authorization that we just received, I would say it this way, you shouldn't expect that we will have that incremental share repurchase authorization complete by the end of this year. So $15 billion, again, remain firmly committed to that. As we talked about the next round of $5 billion, we'll evaluate market conditions and other opportunities that we have. But I wouldn't assume that we'll be done with that $5 billion this year.\nConnor Lynagh: Okay. Understood. The second is a bit more high level. But I know you'd like to think about investing in the business in terms of banks of the river upside, downside. I guess, has there been any change in what you think of the upside in the business based on the events that have been ongoing in the refining industry over the past 3, 6 months? Is there anything that you might not have considered to be a valuable project? I'm thinking there might be some other projects like the STAR project that might not have competed for capital before, but are starting to look more interesting?\nMichael Hennigan: Connor, it's Mike. I think what you're asking is, do we have a more constructive view on mid-cycle. I think the answer to that is, yes, as Rick stated before, right now, we're in a pretty constructive environment. Inventories are low. Demand hasn't gotten back to levels before COVID. So we're still recovering in that regard. So it is a pretty constructive environment. But as far as to your question of, does it change our view, I mean, I think you said it well. We do banks of the river regardless of where the mid-cycle is. We always look at a downside case and an upside case. And at the end of the day, our upside case is aggressive and our downside case is aggressive, so we can really get those banks to the river. I think our mode, and it was mentioned earlier in the call is we are a believer in capital discipline. We do want to invest in the business, but we want to be really strict about where we do that. And again, I keep saying it's a balance between return on capital when we have good opportunities and return of capital. and we've been trying to do a better job in both areas. So I don't think our bigger picture has changed. I mean what you're hearing out of us a lot today is the second quarter showed what we were supposed to do is run reliably. Ray and his team did a terrific job in that regard. That's what you're supposed to do when the margins are where they are because we don't control that side. And then Rick and his team, and Brian and his team look at how do we maximize feedstock profitability and how do we maximize product lease and profitability. And very proud of the team for what they did in the second quarter because it did show some of the discipline we've been trying to achieve because we don't control the margin environment, but we do control how reliably we run. We do control our cost, and we do control how we set ourselves up commercially. So very proud of the team to accomplish what I think was a pretty good second quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: First, I'd like to start off by revisiting some of the comments made about cost inflation and also your continued reiteration of the laser focus on cost controls. As we think about second half of the year and 2023 CapEx expenses, et cetera, can you provide some incremental color on how exactly you're managing this process, especially in light of costs really increasing across the board, be it energy, labor or materials, et cetera?\nMichael Hennigan: Theresa, I'll start, and then I'll let Ray jump in here. We're definitely seeing the impacts of inflation, whether it's materials or anything else along those lines. It's a reality to us. And obviously, everybody can also see the cost of natural gas and where it stands and Mary gave sensitivities during the prepared remarks about where they are. So those are all important things that, again, I put them in the bucket of we don't control that. Obviously, inflation is a big global picture. But what I asked Ray and his team to do is to really focus on areas we do control and try to offset some of these natural higher-cost things that we don't control coming at us. At the end of the day, I mean, he gave a good example of ways that we can do things differently. We can manage our turnaround schedule differently than we've done in the past. We can look at the cost that we're spending in each of those areas differently. It's kind of interesting. For those who know me, I spend a lot of time on the downside, and we've had a pretty upside quarter that we've been talking about. But I think it's good discipline for us to have that reliability mode, to have a good commercial mode, as Rick said, trying to improve ourselves commercially all the time.  And then to your point, Theresa, when inflation comes at you, hopefully, you set a lot of groundwork in your thinking as to how to be disciplined to attack that rather than just complain about it happening because it's going to happen and it's going to happen later times because it's a cyclical business. But Ray and his team have done a very nice job. I'm very proud of where the cost structure of the company has come in the last couple of years.  And now I'll turn it over to him if he wants to add additional color.\nRaymond Brooks: Yes. Not much more to add based on what Mike said. We don't control gas prices, labor costs. We don't necessarily control that. The one thing I will elaborate a little bit on is material cost. When we look at a lot of the work that we have coming up in the near future, whether it's Martinez, whether it's work at Garyville, whether it's Galveston Bay and STAR, most of the large equipment purchase material purchases are already on site. So we've got that, that we're able to check that off from both a cost standpoint and reliability of material supply standpoint. So we'll monitor the situations, whether it's labor or gas and adjust accordingly. But the fundamental premise that we're always looking to be the low-cost operator. We'll continue to strive for that.\nTheresa Chen: And as a follow-up, right, to your comments about the Martinez project, just -- on the heels of the car public workshop, really with the recent one really scrutinizing crop-based feedstocks in general. What is your view on that as it potentially may impact your assets and feedstock procurement plans, if it does?\nRaymond Brooks: Theresa, just one question for clarification. Are you referring to the LCFS plan?\nTheresa Chen: Yes.\nRaymond Brooks: Okay. My partner is shaking the head, yes. Essentially, what that is, we see that as a potential benefit right now where if we step back a year ago, we kind of looked at LCFS as a $200 a ton level. And most recently, we've been in a $90 a ton. But with CARB's recent announcement, and I'll say the state support for a rescoping plan, their desire is to increase the GHG reduction in the state, which at the bottom line will put more pressure on people to generate credits in the states. So we see that as a potential tailwind on from where we are right now. So what I said to an earlier question, though, is there's a lot of moving parts in the renewable diesel economics between RIN and LCFS and BTC and feedstock costs and all that. And we don't necessarily control them, but we balance between them and we feel pretty good right now definitely how our Dickinson economics are working, and we feel real good going into the Martinez project in total.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Since you took over as the CEO in the company, I think, over the past 2.5 years the performance has been quite dramatic improvement the and efficiency and everything has improved. From that standpoint, and you have a good system in pay. So should MPC consider or maybe view themselves as a potential consolidator in the refining industry? We still have quite a recommended market given your strong execution in the platform that you have in pace. That's the first question. The second question is that third quarter turnaround cost is high. So that would suggest that 2022, the total turnaround cost is going to be much above the historical average. So is that partly driven by the catch-up spending from 2020 and '21? Or that it is just purely from the timing of the cycle? And should we assume 2023 will trend back down to a more normal level?\nMichael Hennigan: So, Paul, first of all, thank you for the compliments. It's really been a team effort over the last couple of years. So appreciate your comment there. As far as the consolidator in refining, again, I never say never, but we have enough of a refining footprint in my mind to be effective. At the end of the day, we are believers that we're going to see these good times and bad times in refining. And as I said previously, my own mantra is I want us to be a good performer in the down cycle. And if we can do that, then I know we're going to have the discipline to be a good performer in the up cycle. So we're concentrating on how we run the business regardless of where the margin environment is. You heard Ray on cost, you heard Rick on commercial initiatives. So I think we're in a good spot there, and I think we have enough exposure. I never say never, but the chances of us increasing our footprint in refining is not high. Instead, I do -- I am a big believer in returning capital as we've been doing, but I'm also constantly looking for opportunities for us. And the word I used a lot more is adjacencies. I like to look for things that are close to our business that can make us more competitive. One of my 3 months is take the assets we have today and make them more competitive. And sometimes that has to do with adjacency build-out. Dave and his team have tried to increase the profitability at Dickinson as an example. And Ray mentioned that our feedstock flexibility there has gotten way better. We have a JV that's coming on. It's going to help us there. We've done some other things to change our feedstock flexibility. So that's probably where I spend more time thinking about how to create value than thinking about overall consolidation. So I hope that answers the first one. I'm going to let Ray take the second one.\nRaymond Brooks: Yes, Paul, regarding turnaround and your comment that the third quarter is high. I'll put the caveat in there again that 2022 was back-half weighted. So we ran extremely -- the run rate for the first half was much lower than the run rate for the second half. But if we go back a couple of years, and look at 2020 and 2021, those were lower years from a turnaround standpoint. And yes, when we were in the pandemic, some of the issues we had with wanting to minimize people in our facilities, we did look to lower our turnaround work. So some of the work that we're doing, not all of it, but some of the work is deferred from that period of time. One thing I will tell you that our team really looks at and this is looking at this with -- in conjunction with Rick and Brian's team from the commercial standpoint is we really want to -- we want to do turnarounds at the -- we want to maximize our catalyst cycles. We want to maximize our turnaround cycles. And we also want to try to level the spending as much as possible. So when we look at '22 and '23 and '24, we're looking at optimizing that and trying to level that as to much our capabilities across a period of time. So to answer your question a little bit of deferral from 2021 and a little bit of back half weighted in the second half of '22 versus the first half of '22.\nPaul Cheng: Just as a follow-up, should we assume 2023 as a result going to be materially lower in that than the 2022 activity level on the turnaround?\nMaryann Mannen: Paul, it's Maryann. We're a little early. As you know, we typically will give you a quarter-by-quarter view of how we see turnaround expenses. So we're a bit early to give you a 2023 guidance. So not ready to call that just yet if that's okay.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: So you sound pretty constructive on the demand side of things, particularly gasoline, but we've seen cracks over the futures curve come down quite a bit over the past month. Do you think that aligns with what you're seeing on the ground? Or do you think this move is too far, too fast, cracks, I think, over the next year for gasoline or back below where they were prior to the Russia-Ukraine war? And then I have a follow-up.\nRick Hessling: Jason, it's Rick. It's really a great question because you're right, we have seen a lot of volatility on cracks here the last 2 to 4 weeks specifically, and we expect it to continue. I will say, fundamentally, if you look at where inventories are across the energy sector, they're either at or below 5-year averages. We're getting good demand signals from the consumer. And we're seeing really solid feedstock differentials. We're seeing a Brent TI that's $7 to $10. We're seeing backwardation that is only plus or minus $1.  So I would tell you, from a macro perspective, I think there's upside from here, but I'll pause there and be careful because -- it's a very volatile market. Oftentimes, markets go too high and then they correct and go too low. I believe there's some optimism going forward from a macro perspective really because of those key factors that I just laid out for you.\nJason Gabelman: Understood. That's helpful. And then my second question, just on the distribution update. On last earnings call, you kind of discussed that you would provide some sort of distribution framework update in the near future, and it doesn't seem like we've gotten that on this call. So I'm curious if this is kind of in line with what you're envisioning providing at this time if something changed between that last call and this call or maybe just some misunderstanding on our end?\nMaryann Mannen: Jason, it's Maryann. Look, you're right. I think one of the things that we said was when we finished our $15 billion share repurchase, we would come back to you with a bit more detail. So I think we've been consistent in that, and hopefully, you see that as well. As a part of that, we said we would reassess the dividend at that particular time. We're hopeful that you see the pace at which we are moving to complete that $15 billion as consistent with that communication. So nothing has changed from our views, again, committed to the $15 billion, committed to a reassessment of the dividend at that particular time. And hopefully, the pace gives you some good indication of where that would be. I hope that addresses it, Jason.\nKristina Kazarian: All right. Sheila, Well, if there are no other questions. Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. If you have additional questions or want clarification on topics discussed on the call this morning, please reach out anytime and members of our Investor Relations team will be here to help. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Moving to our sustainability efforts. In June, we published our annual sustainability report and our annual perspective on climate scenarios report. We continue to make progress on our greenhouse gas reduction targets. And through 2021, we have achieved a 23% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 intensity emissions, and an 11% reduction in our absolute Scope 3, Category 11 greenhouse gas emissions.  Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios which is aligned with TCFD standards, provides insight into some of the strategic considerations we take to set meaningful objectives, dedicate resources to accomplish them and then hold ourselves accountable and demonstrate results. Our sustainability report shows continued progress on the sustainability goals that we have set for ourselves, which we have been reporting on since 2011. We believe our investors and other interested stakeholders will find that the extensive disclosures in these reports illustrate our company's financial strength, adaptiveness and resilience to climate-related risks.  Moving to second quarter results. Slide 5 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $10.61. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude a $230 million benefit related to changes in the 2020 and 2021 RVO requirements published by the EPA. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $9.1 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes was almost $7 billion.  During the quarter, we returned $313 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased approximately $3.3 billion of shares. Through the end of July, we have repurchased $4.1 billion of shares since our last earnings call.  Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA, and as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2022 to the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially and driven primarily by an approximately $6.4 billion increase from Refining & Marketing. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of $1.8 billion. The tax rate is higher this last quarter due to refining end marketing representing a larger component of earnings in the quarter.  Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. During the quarter, our R&M team was focused on supplying transportation fuels to meet market demand. Refining ran at 100% utilization processing approximately 2.9 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries safely and reliably. This is the same level of throughput achieved back in 2019 pre-pandemic before the closures of Gallup and Martinez.  Capture was 96%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team in a volatile market. Operating expenses were higher in the second quarter, driven primarily by natural gas prices, which were approximately $3 per MMBtu higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter.  While we have been able to mitigate some of the impact of higher prices, the cost increase we have seen in the first half of the year has been almost entirely driven by higher energy cost. We continue to believe the cost reductions we made to bring our structural operating costs down to approximately $5 per barrel are sustainable. With higher natural gas prices, we would expect operating costs to remain elevated in the third quarter. Distribution costs were modestly higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter due to higher refinery utilization, which resulted in higher system volumes.  Turning to Slide 8, which provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter, our capture results this quarter were impacted by a few key factors. Secondary products continue to be a headwind as prices lag higher light product prices. This was partially offset by strong gasoline and distillate margins as well as higher volumetric gain due to higher product prices.  Product backwardation created a headwind during part of the quarter. But during this time, we were able to leverage our robust logistics capabilities to translate a portion of our physical barrels into the market on a more prompt basis. And our ability to capture 96% of the market indicator across an incredibly volatile 3 months was in part due to our commercial responses.  Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Performance is underpinned by strong operations and a commitment to strict capital discipline.  MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio. As MPLX continues to generate free cash flow, we believe it will have the capacity to return significant capital to its unitholders. Today, MPLX announced an incremental $1 billion unit repurchase authorization.  Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $7 billion in the quarter, which excludes changes in working capital. Working capital was roughly flat for the quarter as we saw benefits from an increase in crude oil payables related to higher refining throughput, offset by a build in crude oil inventories. Since the first quarter of 2021, working capital related to increasing prices has been a source of cash flow.  Capital expenditures and investments totaled $546 million this quarter. We continue to spend on our STAR project, which is projected to increase crude capacity at the Galveston Bay refinery by 40,000 barrels per day. This project is expected to be completed early 2023. We are progressing the conversion of Martinez renewable fuel facility and expect the first phase to be mechanically complete by year-end.  During the quarter, MPC returned $313 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $3.3 billion worth of shares. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $13.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.  As Mike mentioned earlier, we remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Our objective has been to complete the $15 billion repurchase program no later than the end of this year. We remain on track to meet this commitment. Upon completion of the program, we will reassess our dividend level.  Since the launch of this program in May 2021, we have repurchased approximately 12.1 billion shares at an average share price of approximately $74 per share. Over this time, we have reduced MPC share count by approximately 162 million shares or over 24%. We've received the Board's approval for a separate and incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We'll work through our capital allocation priorities and continue to assess the market environment to determine how we might execute against this authorization.  Turning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our third quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day representing 94% utilization. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than second quarter due to higher planned turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $400 million in the third quarter with activity spread across all 3 regions.  As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, our planned turnaround activity is back half weighted for 2022. Turnaround activity is reflected in our third quarter throughput guidance we expect this elevated level of activity may reduce our light product yields. We'll optimize to minimize the impacts, but we think our capture rate for the third quarter could be lower than the second quarter.  In coordinating maintenance work, we'll always try to maximize turnaround and catalyst cycles to the economic optimum, but we also do not compromise on safety or asset integrity and ensure work is scheduled to achieve this balance Total operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel for the quarter. We are expecting higher operating costs in the third quarter. This is primarily driven by the elevated cost of natural gas as well as slightly higher project expense work, which we normally coordinate to occur during turnarounds to limit the impact on throughput reduction.  As a reminder, natural gas has historically represented approximately 15% of operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity of approximately $330 million of annual EBITDA for every $1 change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost.  Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the third quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area.  In closing, we will continue to optimize our system to provide as much transportation fuel to the market as demand requires. We remain committed to advancing our low-cost initiatives and focused on areas to drive continued commercial outperformance, and we will stay steadfast in our plan to execute against our capital allocation priorities to drive shareholder value.  Let me turn the call back to Kristina. Connor, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. So I think you captured it right. As we said, we are committed to completing that $15 billion no later than this year -- at the end of this year, excuse me. And you can see by the pace that we have been executing that clearly in the quarter as well, $3.3 billion in the quarter, $4.1 billion since the last time we met on the earnings call, we remain committed and on track to deliver that. As we talk about the additional $5 billion authorization that we just received, I would say it this way, you shouldn't expect that we will have that incremental share repurchase authorization complete by the end of this year. So $15 billion, again, remain firmly committed to that. As we talked about the next round of $5 billion, we'll evaluate market conditions and other opportunities that we have. But I wouldn't assume that we'll be done with that $5 billion this year. Paul, it's Maryann. We're a little early. As you know, we typically will give you a quarter-by-quarter view of how we see turnaround expenses. So we're a bit early to give you a 2023 guidance. So not ready to call that just yet if that's okay. Jason, it's Maryann. Look, you're right. I think one of the things that we said was when we finished our $15 billion share repurchase, we would come back to you with a bit more detail. So I think we've been consistent in that, and hopefully, you see that as well. As a part of that, we said we would reassess the dividend at that particular time. We're hopeful that you see the pace at which we are moving to complete that $15 billion as consistent with that communication. So nothing has changed from our views, again, committed to the $15 billion, committed to a reassessment of the dividend at that particular time. And hopefully, the pace gives you some good indication of where that would be. I hope that addresses it, Jason."

            "name": "Rick Hessling",
            "content": "Yes, Neil, really great question because we are seeing a lot of volatility in both of those markets, specifically to TI first. We're seeing strong production in the Permian and both on the WTI and WTL specifically. So if you look at where MPC is positioned and with our pipeline commitments with Galveston Bay really sitting in the backyard of the Permian. There's really nobody better positioned than us to take advantage of TI and TL. And then specifically on WCS, that has widened out to 21-plus under. And that's happening, Neil, for a variety of reasons. One, we believe the SPR barrels have put significant pressure on the medium sour barrels in the Gulf Coast, and WCS needs to clear to the Gulf Coast. So it needs to compete directly with the medium sour barrel, and the early SPR releases were predominantly medium sour. So from an MPC perspective, we have historical space out of Canada. We're able to take advantage of that in all 3 regions, the West Coast, the Mid-Con and now the Gulf Coast. So we feel very good about that macro environment going forward. If those are still open, we'll be as well positioned as anyone to capture those advantages. Yes. So Manav, so hand-in-hand with op costs goes refining margin per barrel. And we have really taken Mike's push on improving the commercial performance. We have an acronym we call CCI, continual commercial improvement, and the Gulf Coast -- and this is -- this goes for all 3 regions, but the Gulf Coast specifically, I think you're continuing to see us separate ourselves and improve quarter-to-quarter. And in simple terms, Manav, what we're doing is we are expanding the crack. We are expanding the margin from feedstocks to products. We're optimizing every day. It's a focus that is relentless within our team, and it's something truly that's been going on for years, but you're now really seeing the dividends of the optionality that the team has created, the logistical flexibility and our ability to take a feedstock into the refinery for raise team, his successful operating metrics that he's shown and proven that he's best in industry for quite some time with his toolkit.  And then taking that all the way to the end consumer, I can't stress enough how proud we are of our team and it's an initiative that's very important to us and one that I think you'll continually -- I'll ask you to continually watch because I feel confident in our performance in the quarters ahead as well. This is Rick. So I'll take capture first. And I'll pivot back to -- before I specifically address your question, pivot back to Manav's point, one of the reasons you're seeing our capture where it's at is optionality. So optionality within our system really directly to your point, whether it's the Harbor or the Gulf Coast that blows out on diesel and gas, we are structuring our entire system to have optionality. We don't know when and where the differentials will blow out what will be favored 1 month versus the next. What I can tell you is when it happens, we have the system to take advantage of it. And that's years and years of really preparing for optionality within the system. Specifically, to your question on the Harbor versus the Gulf Coast, that's a tough call. It appears right now, as you said, gas is in favor. Where that will go will be interesting. I think part of that will be on inventories, how they play out within each of the regions as well as demand.  And from a demand perspective, we are seeing very bullish signals from the consumer right now. So we are quite optimistic on that front. John, this is Rick. So going forward, it's been interesting. I'll back up and just talk about July and then where we're at today. So early in July, we had a little bit of a speed bump in and then around the 4th of July where demand was slightly below where we thought it should be. Ever since then, though, we've seen week-on-week increases and demand is picking up really across the board, but specifically in gasoline, diesel steady. And as Mike said in his opening comments around jet. Jet is 20% over quarter-on-quarter 2Q, anyways of -- from where we were a year ago, and we're getting very strong indicators from the airlines and the travel industry on domestic travel via jet. Specifically, going forward, we're seeing a very resilient consumer with a lot of pent-up demand and the trends look very promising. Now certainly, you have the headwinds of inflation, rising interest rates, et cetera. But right now, I would say the falling street price that has been permeated by the falling WTI market is winning the day. And the consumer is showing us very positive demand signals today, and we view that going forward as well. Jason, it's Rick. It's really a great question because you're right, we have seen a lot of volatility on cracks here the last 2 to 4 weeks specifically, and we expect it to continue. I will say, fundamentally, if you look at where inventories are across the energy sector, they're either at or below 5-year averages. We're getting good demand signals from the consumer. And we're seeing really solid feedstock differentials. We're seeing a Brent TI that's $7 to $10. We're seeing backwardation that is only plus or minus $1.  So I would tell you, from a macro perspective, I think there's upside from here, but I'll pause there and be careful because -- it's a very volatile market. Oftentimes, markets go too high and then they correct and go too low. I believe there's some optimism going forward from a macro perspective really because of those key factors that I just laid out for you."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Raymond Brooks",
            "content": "Okay. Neil, this is Ray Brooks, and I'll take your question on that. You're right. There are a lot of moving parts to the economics of renewable diesel some recent headwinds, LCFS price is a little lower than we would have anticipated feedstock prices across the board a little higher. And then there's some tailwinds. We've got a bigger contribution from RIN pricing, a bigger contribution from RD prices. So a lot of moving pieces in the equation. But one thing I'll tell you is when we look at like our Dickinson project, when you take all the puts and takes, the plus and minuses together, we're pretty much on par with where we expected the project to come in. And so that's our experience with Dickinson. We expect the same type of contribution with Martinez going forward. One thing that I would like to add, though, is what we really do is a lot of things I'm talking about outside of our control, whether the regulatory prices, the feedstock price is going to be. I'd really like to focus on what we do and specific to Dickinson, we pay attention to all the feedstocks and we pivoted to the most lowest cost feedstock slate, the lowest carbon intensity slate by optimizing our feedstock acquisition process. The other thing we did is even though that, that project was supposed to be 100% refined bleach deodorized soybean oil, we used our pretreatment facilities at Beatrice, Nebraska and Cincinnati to essentially bring in a fully pretreated feed slate in there. So really concentrate on the things that we can control to deliver the EBITDA. But a lot of moving parts, and we're just doing the best we can with it. Okay. Manav, this is Ray Brooks, and I'll take that question. I think it comes down to a couple of things. One is definitely paying attention to cost control striving to be the low cost, safe, reliable operator. And then the other key word is reliability. So when we look at the Gulf Coast for the second quarter, we ran extremely well, 1.35 million barrels a day of throughput in those 2 assets at Garyville and Galveston Bay. So best ever performance there out of those assets and they're phenomenal assets. And then the other thing is it's just concentrating on costs. We talked about this many times over the earnings calls in the last couple of years. We've got 2 refineries there that performed very well in the Solomon OpEx survey that comes out every 2 years. Garyville, historically, has been a very good first quartile refinery and Galveston Bay has improved over the past couple of years. So just strict cost discipline after we pay attention to all of our safety and maintenance cap just questioning everything we're spending there and running reliable. So even though your question was on cost in the Gulf Coast, we're really happy with 2Q with our margin performance. So I'm going to let Rick talk a little bit on that. Roger, this is Ray. And I'll give you an update on Martinez. And I'll go back to the beginning of second quarter. On May 3, we were pretty excited when we got the EIR, the environmental impact report, the final one approved by Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors. So that was big and that let us with one more permit, which was the air permit with Bay Area Air Quality Management District. And so they spent the next couple of months doing a technical review and actually recently, July 22, they posted that permit for public comment, which is a 30-day comment period, which would end in August 21. So when that public comment period ends, they, along with us, providing input, will respond to any comments, and that should be the end. So what -- getting the air permit will be big deal. That allows us to start to unit up when it's ready, and it also allows us to close our joint venture partnership with Neste. So where would we see the light at the end of the tunnel coming on that one. Yes. This is Ray again. So I'll take that question, John. Yes, you're right. We ran at 100% utilization in 2Q. And then in the third quarter, we're guiding to 94% utilization. And if you look at our turnaround number, up $400 million. That's because we have more turnaround plus catalyst work that's -- that we'll be doing in this 3-month period. One thing I'd like to highlight, though, is one of the reasons we ran 100% in 2Q is we really wanted to meet market demand. And so we challenge ourselves to what we could do in that regard. And just 1 example, we had 1 unit at one of our plants where a hydrocracker, we could squeeze a little bit more life out of the catalyst. And so we made a conscious decision to run through that in 2Q and do pick that work up in 3Q.  So we made those decisions. It looks like they're the right thing to do, but we do have a little bit more work coming up in the third quarter. Yes. Not much more to add based on what Mike said. We don't control gas prices, labor costs. We don't necessarily control that. The one thing I will elaborate a little bit on is material cost. When we look at a lot of the work that we have coming up in the near future, whether it's Martinez, whether it's work at Garyville, whether it's Galveston Bay and STAR, most of the large equipment purchase material purchases are already on site. So we've got that, that we're able to check that off from both a cost standpoint and reliability of material supply standpoint. So we'll monitor the situations, whether it's labor or gas and adjust accordingly. But the fundamental premise that we're always looking to be the low-cost operator. We'll continue to strive for that. Theresa, just one question for clarification. Are you referring to the LCFS plan? Okay. My partner is shaking the head, yes. Essentially, what that is, we see that as a potential benefit right now where if we step back a year ago, we kind of looked at LCFS as a $200 a ton level. And most recently, we've been in a $90 a ton. But with CARB's recent announcement, and I'll say the state support for a rescoping plan, their desire is to increase the GHG reduction in the state, which at the bottom line will put more pressure on people to generate credits in the states. So we see that as a potential tailwind on from where we are right now. So what I said to an earlier question, though, is there's a lot of moving parts in the renewable diesel economics between RIN and LCFS and BTC and feedstock costs and all that. And we don't necessarily control them, but we balance between them and we feel pretty good right now definitely how our Dickinson economics are working, and we feel real good going into the Martinez project in total. Yes, Paul, regarding turnaround and your comment that the third quarter is high. I'll put the caveat in there again that 2022 was back-half weighted. So we ran extremely -- the run rate for the first half was much lower than the run rate for the second half. But if we go back a couple of years, and look at 2020 and 2021, those were lower years from a turnaround standpoint. And yes, when we were in the pandemic, some of the issues we had with wanting to minimize people in our facilities, we did look to lower our turnaround work. So some of the work that we're doing, not all of it, but some of the work is deferred from that period of time. One thing I will tell you that our team really looks at and this is looking at this with -- in conjunction with Rick and Brian's team from the commercial standpoint is we really want to -- we want to do turnarounds at the -- we want to maximize our catalyst cycles. We want to maximize our turnaround cycles. And we also want to try to level the spending as much as possible. So when we look at '22 and '23 and '24, we're looking at optimizing that and trying to level that as to much our capabilities across a period of time. So to answer your question a little bit of deferral from 2021 and a little bit of back half weighted in the second half of '22 versus the first half of '22."

            "name": "Michael Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our operational activity was driven by strong market demand for transportation fuels we manufacture. Demand remains resilient, largely driven by the removal of globally imposed mobility restrictions and the pent-up desire to travel.  Jet fuel demand continued its recovery, up nearly 20% from the same quarter last year, with the increased resumption of travel. Gasoline demand remained very resilient through the quarter in part due to the start of the summer driving season. Diesel demand after a strong beginning to the year, softened a bit in the second quarter due to lower trucking volumes.  During the second quarter, in order to meet robust customer demand, we ran our refining system at full utilization. We optimized our system to provide as much transportation fuel to the market as possible. Commercially, we optimized around our scale, footprint and feedstock slate to meet this customer demand.  This resulted in an adjusted EBITDA of $9.1 billion as we saw crack spreads this quarter respond to uncertainty in the product markets, driven by the potential for sanction impacts on top of an already tight supply and related inventory levels.  Maryann will walk you through the details of our results. But looking forward, we expect tight supply, low inventory levels and strong global demand to continue to incentivize high refining runs into the third quarter. We will continue to execute on what we can control running a safe, reliable, low-cost system, improving our commercial performance and strengthening the competitive performance of our assets.  On capital allocation, we remain committed to the 4 priorities we previously outlined. First, we're going to take care of our assets by deploying maintenance capital. We want to ensure we can safely operate our assets protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.  Second, we're committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. And as we've stated in the past, once we complete the $15 billion capital return program that resulted from the Speedway sale, we will reassess the level of our dividend.  Third, we see this as a return on as well as the return of capital business. As we enter the second half of the year, our capital spending outlook remains on track.  We continue to progress our Martinez renewable fuels facility with the first phase of the facility currently targeted to be mechanically complete by year-end. Once completed, the facility is expected to be capable of bringing nearly 50,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel supply into the market.  We also expect to be able to close our JV with Neste in the coming months. The time frame for completing the facility and closing the JV are dependent upon the timing of obtaining the air quality permit. We'll continue to look for other opportunities to generate a return on capital such as cost reduction projects and opportunities that build out our competencies and increase our competitive advantages to drive returns and shareholder value.  And fourth, after executing against the first 3 objectives, we look to return capital to shareholders. In the 3 months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased $4.1 billion of shares. And today, we announced a separate and incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization.  At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann. Yes, Doug, we have talked about this before. I mean we continue to look at it. It's not something that we have off the radar screen. But we continue to come to the same conclusion we have for quite some time that those other situations where people are rolling up their MLPs, we think, are in a much different situation than we are. We're pretty pleased with our MLP's performance, continues to kick cash back to MPC. The structure itself, obviously, it's going out of favor with investors for a little bit, but we think that's starting to turn around as well.  So it's something we keep looking at, Doug. But at the end of the day, we're still comfortable with the structure that we have. And we think it works for the Marathon family to have both MPC and MPLX. Yes, Doug, it's a good question. And I know some people have been asking us on the last couple of calls where we are on the dividend. I think if I'm right or if I'm wrong, we stated that we were going to maximize the share buyback program and complete that and then reset the dividend. That's still our intention. We're $12 billion through the $15 billion program. Everybody has seen the pace at which we can execute and that's guided by our trading volume and the programs that we have in place.  So we're pretty close to talking about that in a more constructive way, we are committed, and we said this in our remarks, we're committed to a competitive dividend. We want to show the market that we'll grow that dividend. It's probably taken a little longer than everybody's patience has been as far as this return program, but it's actually been executing well in our mind.  As Maryann said in the prepared remarks, we bought back quite a bit of the shares at $74. So we're feeling pretty good about that in general. And we're not too far off of the releasing to the market where our head is on the dividend. Good question, Neil. Let me let Rick take that. Yes, Manav. I think the answer to that is yes. I mean, obviously, we probably would prefer to do that at the MPLX level as opposed to MPC. But we are definitely looking and trying to figure out ways to create value in both of those basins. I mean, as everybody knows, we've said for quite some time that we're going to concentrate in the Permian and concentrate in the Marcellus area. We did announce on the call earlier today that we are advancing a couple more processing plants, one up in the Marcellus, which has been kind of a constrained area for a little bit of time now and it looks like growth is going to start to pick up there. And then we've also announced another plant down in the Permian as well. So yes, we're very attentive. Hopefully, we'll find more opportunities in both of those basins because we think they're both going to continue to grow. I mean everybody is very aware of the global natural gas situation. We remain constructive on it, and we're trying to be as involved in that growth as we can be. Connor, it's Mike. I think what you're asking is, do we have a more constructive view on mid-cycle. I think the answer to that is, yes, as Rick stated before, right now, we're in a pretty constructive environment. Inventories are low. Demand hasn't gotten back to levels before COVID. So we're still recovering in that regard. So it is a pretty constructive environment. But as far as to your question of, does it change our view, I mean, I think you said it well. We do banks of the river regardless of where the mid-cycle is. We always look at a downside case and an upside case. And at the end of the day, our upside case is aggressive and our downside case is aggressive, so we can really get those banks to the river. I think our mode, and it was mentioned earlier in the call is we are a believer in capital discipline. We do want to invest in the business, but we want to be really strict about where we do that. And again, I keep saying it's a balance between return on capital when we have good opportunities and return of capital. and we've been trying to do a better job in both areas. So I don't think our bigger picture has changed. I mean what you're hearing out of us a lot today is the second quarter showed what we were supposed to do is run reliably. Ray and his team did a terrific job in that regard. That's what you're supposed to do when the margins are where they are because we don't control that side. And then Rick and his team, and Brian and his team look at how do we maximize feedstock profitability and how do we maximize product lease and profitability. And very proud of the team for what they did in the second quarter because it did show some of the discipline we've been trying to achieve because we don't control the margin environment, but we do control how reliably we run. We do control our cost, and we do control how we set ourselves up commercially. So very proud of the team to accomplish what I think was a pretty good second quarter. Theresa, I'll start, and then I'll let Ray jump in here. We're definitely seeing the impacts of inflation, whether it's materials or anything else along those lines. It's a reality to us. And obviously, everybody can also see the cost of natural gas and where it stands and Mary gave sensitivities during the prepared remarks about where they are. So those are all important things that, again, I put them in the bucket of we don't control that. Obviously, inflation is a big global picture. But what I asked Ray and his team to do is to really focus on areas we do control and try to offset some of these natural higher-cost things that we don't control coming at us. At the end of the day, I mean, he gave a good example of ways that we can do things differently. We can manage our turnaround schedule differently than we've done in the past. We can look at the cost that we're spending in each of those areas differently. It's kind of interesting. For those who know me, I spend a lot of time on the downside, and we've had a pretty upside quarter that we've been talking about. But I think it's good discipline for us to have that reliability mode, to have a good commercial mode, as Rick said, trying to improve ourselves commercially all the time.  And then to your point, Theresa, when inflation comes at you, hopefully, you set a lot of groundwork in your thinking as to how to be disciplined to attack that rather than just complain about it happening because it's going to happen and it's going to happen later times because it's a cyclical business. But Ray and his team have done a very nice job. I'm very proud of where the cost structure of the company has come in the last couple of years.  And now I'll turn it over to him if he wants to add additional color. So, Paul, first of all, thank you for the compliments. It's really been a team effort over the last couple of years. So appreciate your comment there. As far as the consolidator in refining, again, I never say never, but we have enough of a refining footprint in my mind to be effective. At the end of the day, we are believers that we're going to see these good times and bad times in refining. And as I said previously, my own mantra is I want us to be a good performer in the down cycle. And if we can do that, then I know we're going to have the discipline to be a good performer in the up cycle. So we're concentrating on how we run the business regardless of where the margin environment is. You heard Ray on cost, you heard Rick on commercial initiatives. So I think we're in a good spot there, and I think we have enough exposure. I never say never, but the chances of us increasing our footprint in refining is not high. Instead, I do -- I am a big believer in returning capital as we've been doing, but I'm also constantly looking for opportunities for us. And the word I used a lot more is adjacencies. I like to look for things that are close to our business that can make us more competitive. One of my 3 months is take the assets we have today and make them more competitive. And sometimes that has to do with adjacency build-out. Dave and his team have tried to increase the profitability at Dickinson as an example. And Ray mentioned that our feedstock flexibility there has gotten way better. We have a JV that's coming on. It's going to help us there. We've done some other things to change our feedstock flexibility. So that's probably where I spend more time thinking about how to create value than thinking about overall consolidation. So I hope that answers the first one. I'm going to let Ray take the second one."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on the website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan CEO; Maryann Mannen CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our SEC filings. With that I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment. Year-over-year demand trends have been for the most part positive and the market seems to have reached a post-COVID point of stability. Distillate remains stable, jet continues to recover and gasoline has been more resilient than we would have expected given normal seasonality and recent geopolitical events. The biggest factor outside of our control is changes in global supply and demand. At the end of 2021, Global light product inventories were already tight. Sanctions and boycotts following the Russian invasion of Ukraine have increased supply uncertainties. Product margins have risen to cover the higher cost structure of marginal supply particularly in European regions where there's a high reliance on Russian natural gas. We expect continued volatility in 2022 with an advantage for safe, reliable and low-cost operators. We are focused on optimizing our maintenance schedules to maximize uptime and allow us to do what we can to produce volumes to meet the market demand. As we do this, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate. With this in mind, we anticipate the US refining system running at higher utilization rates in the coming quarters to meet rising demand. MPC's first quarter results reflect the continued recovery for our products and services, which supported higher margins and higher throughput across regions. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion. We repurchased $2.8 billion in shares in the quarter. And since our last earnings call we have repurchased $2.5 billion of shares. Through today we've completed 80% of our initial $10 billion capital return commitment. I would also like to highlight the strength of MPLX in our portfolio. Last year MPC received $2.2 billion of distributions from MPLX. As MPLX continues to generate free cash flow, we believe it will have the capacity to return significant cash to MPC and its public unitholders. Another milestone in our sustainability objectives was the joint venture agreement with Neste for the Martinez renewable fuels project. This strategic partnership with Neste enhances our Martinez project by leveraging our complementary strengths and expertise. The project will utilize existing process infrastructure, diverse inbound and outbound logistics and is optimally located to support California's LCFS goals, while strengthening MPC's footprint in renewable fuels. Our intended partnership with Neste also creates a platform for additional collaboration within renewables. We believe there will be opportunities to leverage this partnership between two industry leaders, as we pursue our shared commitment to the energy evolution and the goal of leading in sustainable energy. MPC will manage project execution and operate the facility once construction is complete. Additionally, MPLX Logistics assets support Martinez will remain owned and operated by MPLX. We are progressing through the permit process. Contra Costa County certified the Environmental Impact Report for the Martinez project and we're hopeful that the county will shortly provide final approval. We remain excited about the prospects of the project and its ability to deliver low carbon intensity fuels to support California's climate goals. Shifting to slide 5, we focus on challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. In February, we became the first among our peers to establish a 2030 target to reduce absolute Scope three greenhouse gas emissions by 15% below 2019 levels. The new Scope three target further enhances MPC's disclosures in addition to our existing Scope one and two reduction targets. MPLX also established a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity from natural gas gathering and processing operations by 75% below 2016 levels. In the second quarter, we will publish our annual sustainability and perspectives on climate-related scenarios reports and provide updates on the progress on the goals we have previously said. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann to review the first quarter results.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.49. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes was $1.9 billion, which is roughly in line with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we returned $330 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased approximately $2.8 billion in shares, which takes us to $2.5 billion repurchased, since our last earnings call. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA, as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially, driven primarily by $175 million decrease from refining and marketing. The tax rate for the quarter was 19%, which reflects the benefits from the public portion of MPLX net income which is not taxable to MPC. Moving to our segment results. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. The business reported strong first quarter earnings with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion. Utilization was 91% for the quarter. The sequential decline was driven by lower production, which was primarily the result of unplanned downtime in the US Gulf Coast, where we experienced two unplanned outages. In the beginning of February, the Galveston Bay refinery experienced a citywide power loss which resulted in a complete plant outage. Later in the month, as we were bringing our Garyville refinery back to service, following turnaround activities, a fire occurred near our hydrocracker unit. The unit was repaired and returned to service after about three weeks. Both of these events resulted in approximately $200 million of lost profit opportunity. Margin headwinds in the quarter were a result of the lower capture of 84% that we experienced this quarter and were primarily realized in the Gulf and West Coast.  Operating expenses were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to lower planned project expense as well as a lower average natural gas price coupled with lower energy consumption compared to the fourth quarter. Natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter, averaging over $0.70 in MMBtu higher in March than in January. In April, natural gas prices averaged $6.70 in MMBtu or nearly 80% higher than the average price in 2021.  The current forward strip for Henry Hub is around $8 for the rest of the year, so we would expect natural gas to be a headwind as the year progresses. Natural gas is an input cost for our refineries which historically has represented approximately 15% of our operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity is approximately $330 million of EBITDA for every $1 change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost. Distribution costs were lower in the first quarter due to lower product volumes. Turning to Slide 9. We want to directly address the refining and marketing capture this quarter. In the first quarter our capture result was 84%. A few factors drove the majority of the headwinds. Secondary and light product margins impacts associated with inventory builds and associated derivative views to manage volatility and to a lesser extent Gulf Coast refinery outages impacted our yields. Slide 10 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $1.9 billion in the quarter which excludes changes in working capital. Working capital was an approximate $600 million source of cash this quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude oil prices, partially offset by increases in crude and product inventory. In March MPLX issued $1.5 billion worth of long-term debt utilizing a large portion of the proceeds to repay the borrowings under the intercompany loan with MPC. During the quarter, MPC returned $330 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $2.8 billion worth of shares. Now 80% complete with our initial $10 billion capital return commitment, we could begin using the $5 billion incremental authorization starting in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $10.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Last week, we held our Annual General Meeting which concluded our proxy season, we appreciate the engagement from our investors as we work to create shareholder value, focus on sustainability and position ourselves to deliver results in an energy diverse future. Turning to guidance. On Slide 12, we provide our second quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.9 million barrels per day representing 95% utilization. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $155 million in the second quarter. Expected activity is relatively light and spread through all three regions. As Mike mentioned, our optimized turnaround schedule in the second quarter is expected to allow us to run our assets safely and reliably at high utilization as we remain focused on supplying the products and services markets are demanding. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel for the quarter. Earlier in the call, we shared our natural gas sensitivity the increase we are currently seeing for natural gas costs are reflected in our second quarter guidance, on top of our average baseline $5 per barrel of operating cost. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million. As we look at the impact of inflation on full year results the two areas of focus are wages and certain supply chain inputs. However, we have identified incremental sustainable cost reductions that we are executing against to offset these costs. Notwithstanding all of that, we will continue to identify the headwind from rising energy cost to our refining system throughout the year. Slide 13 provides our capital investment plan for 2022. Once we have closed on the Martinez JV. MPC will receive $400 million and be reimbursed for 50% of the capital spent to-date. After the JV is closed, MPC will be responsible for it\u2019s 50% share of the capital spend going forward and Neste will be responsible for its 50% share. The total cost for the Martinez refinery conversion is still expected to be $1.2 billion and MPC's net cost will be reduced to approximately $200 million. We will provide a more detailed update once we have closed the JV. As a reminder, ongoing growth projects in our Refining and Marketing segment will enhance the capability of our refining assets particularly in the Gulf Coast and also support our focus on growing the value recognized from our Marathon and Arco marketing brands. With that let me turn the call back over to Kristina. \nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. Operator, we'll now open the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question today is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. \nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. The first question is around utilization. The 2Q guide at around 95% is very good. And so I was just curious if you made any adjustments to the system? And then how are you just thinking about optimizing whether its maintenance or your runs to make sure that you capture the strong current spot commodity environment? \nMike Hennigan: It's a good question, Neil. Ray, do you want to take that? \nRay Brooks: Sure. Thanks for the question, Neil. As we've said before, our 2022 turnaround plan was back-end loaded. So you shouldn't look at the first two quarters of the year and extrapolate the spend for the later quarters. But with current demands, we are really seeking to maximize our refining system as indicated by the second quarter guidance. What this really means Neil is that we've looked at some fixed bed catalyst changes that we had planned for the second quarter. We've determined we have a little bit as far as catalyst activity. So we've deferred that out later in the year. So our plan right now is to run really, really full -- run really hard during gasoline season this year. \nNeil Mehta: Very clear. And then it's amazing how far we've come in 1.5 years, isn't it Mike? And I look at your dividend yield now, which is call it 2.5%. And by virtue of the stock having done well, it's compressed to something well below the XLE. How do you think about when it makes sense to have the conversation about raising the fixed dividend again? And do you think recognizing it's at the discretion of the Board. \nMike Hennigan: Yes. Thanks Neil. It's another good question and we talk about it a lot. I'll let Mary comment on it. \nMaryann Mannen: Hey Neil thanks. Yes. So, hopefully, you saw as we shared our capital allocation framework, we remain very committed to the dividend. As Mike just mentioned to you it's getting a tremendous amount of attention from the management team. It's on our conversations regularly with our Board. We recognize where the yield is. And certainly as we look at the strength particularly in the back half of the year, we'll expect to come back to you here in the very near future with our plans particularly as we are getting through our first round of share repurchase. So, you should expect us to be back to you here shortly on that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Good morning everyone. So, I don't know if this is for Mary or for Ray, but I think it's really a question around momentum coming into the second quarter. You guys had a lot of downtime as you pointed out. So, I'm trying to get a feel for what the underlying trend has been in this environment? And I guess specifically whether you are continuing to maximize distillate in your system or whether you are given the current relative spreads whether you will in fire pivot more towards gasoline going through the summer? \nRay Brooks: Sure Doug. Let me take your question as far as distillate production. The answer is absolutely yes. We're working right now to maximize distillate production across our system. Just to give you a little more color on that that's something that we look at daily make sure that we're maximizing the total recoverable distillate, the endpoint and maximizing the front end of the distillate. And then the real thing is just looking at our distillate hydrotreater across the system are full. And so we're doing that across our system. It depends on the toolkit from refinery-to-refinery as far as what that percentage is Gary, but would be the highest since it has a hydrocracker distal hydrotreaters, but whether we have on distillate hydrotreater or three, we're working to maximize across the system.\nMike Hennigan: Sorry Doug I wasn't clear. So, maybe what I was -- thank you for that ray. Maryann what I was really trying to get a handle on was if you could quantify in some way that lost opportunity costs from the first quarter? And what that momentum looks like as you go into the second quarter with the system back up possible?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes, certainly Doug. So, for both the Galveston Bay unplanned outage due to the power issue and then again as we talked about Garyville, we've said it's roughly about $200 million in lost profit opportunity, right? ,So that we would have shared with you through the market indicator. I think the other issue there with both of those refineries being down is the fact that as you heard Ray talk about our ability to maximize. We lost the opportunity to increase yield there which obviously, as they come back online and have in the second quarter given the momentum assuming the macro holds as we expected will and cracks, we'll be able to recover that in the second quarter also.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. My follow-up is actually also a Gulf Coast question. Folks, if you don't mind, I'm going to try and explain what I'm looking for here. It seems that Colonial is being underallocated thus the tightness in the Northeast. And from what we can tell, it doesn't seem that that's going to change much given the call on exports for distillate. So, I'm curious if you could share how you're running your system as it relates to potential Colonial allocations versus the coal and exports, because it seems to us the Northeast is going to remain fairly tighter.\nMike Hennigan: Brian, do you want to take that one?\nBrian Partee: Yeah, sure Mike. Yeah. So, great question Doug. So, yeah, we definitely see the same dynamic that you're seeing. One of the factors that we look at in shipping barrels all the way up to New York Harbor is the market structure as well. So we've had a really, really strong run up here in the prompt on the front end of the cycle. So that's kind of the bid-ask dynamic ongoing right now with buyers and sellers is the sustainability of that. It certainly is starting to feel a lot more sticky as we look at imports coming into the New York Harbor starting to back off. But in the Gulf Coast, we also have really good placement opportunities not only our book but just across the overall complex, is there's more barrels being demanded in Central and South America. So, I would categorize it Doug is we're in a very, very acute pinch point here in the short-term over those market dynamics. But I think you're reading the tea leaves right as you look forward and think about less Russian exports and European complex starting to find a way to rebalance, the New York Harbor market is one that we expect to be impacted more so than other markets. And as you think about the connectivity via pipe in the Gulf Coast, we do look at that as a forward opportunity more structural and longer term.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: I guess first, Maryann, I'd like to come back to your comment about potentially hitting into the next tranche of the share repurchase during Q2 full disclosure. We've been modeling a little bit of a moderation in share buybacks. It doesn't sound like there's any reason for us to actually go forward with that. So, I was just curious how you're thinking about the cash flow coming in and the process of transitioning that into the share repo.\nMaryann Mannen: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Roger. So, no, you're correct. As I shared on the -- in my prepared remarks, if you look at the pace that we've been buying back, we would expect in the second quarter that we would begin to use that $5 billion authorization. In less than 12 months, we started our program in May of 2021. We've repurchased 80% or roughly $8 billion of our initial $10 billion commitment. If we look at that result through the end of the third quarter -- excuse me, the end of the first quarter. So we end at 331, we repurchased about 113 million shares at an average price of just less than $67 a share. We use part of our process. We use a mechanism that allows us to buy back through blackout periods. And during our quarterly buybacks, there's things that we will evaluate market conditions average daily trading volumes to be exact. So, we don't think anything that you maybe seeing in this quarter is indicative of a lack of commitment here by any means. And certainly, you look at the cash flow for the last several quarters strong and you look at the cash balance that I shared is you about $10.6 billion. So, hopefully that addresses your question.\nRoger Read: Yeah. It does. It helps. Thank you. I'm going to ask, kind of the opposite end of the Gulf Coast question on exports. West Coast, obviously, crack has been pretty exceptional. There aren't a lot of places that we typically see products show up on the West Coast from, except for Gulf Coast and occasionally some shipments from Europe. I was curious, as you look across the Pacific, is there anything you're seeing there? We've got lockdowns in some of those countries, so presumably some excess supply. But is there any of that that seems to be coming across the Pacific or any signs that any of that wants to try to come across given the arm?\nMike Hennigan: Brian, do you want to take that?\nBrian Partee: Yes. Sure, Mike. Yes. So, Roger, in the prompt, no not really. We're not seeing any fundamental shifts on the West Coast or the Pacific Basin. We, of course, continue to watch very closely at the lockdowns happening over in Asia. But they seem to be moving through a bit quicker than expected. I mean, we've all learned to deal with COVID a little bit differently than we did two years ago. So we're not seeing anything in the prompt. But I might maybe just back up and give you some perspective on exports more broadly, I think, it might be helpful, especially on the front end of the diesel strength that we see across the market. I mean, one of the key drivers obviously is recovery in jet demand. We're seeing that domestically and also around the world. The other thing that doesn't get a lot of discussion in the prompt is. Recall back in 2020, we were moving into IMO and different marine fueling. And that did take place. So there's a new call on demand on the distillate pool from MGO that we believe is also pulling on the distillate pool. But from an overall perspective, as we look at our export program, predominantly on the Gulf Coast, we do have some limited exports out of the West Coast. As we exited the first quarter, we were about 200,000 barrels a day of exports from the Gulf Coast, primarily into Latin and South America. But we did move barrels into Europe and we see that as an increasing opportunity for us going forward. And as we look at the forward book here into 2Q, we're moving from a 200,000 barrel a day-ish program to more in the 250,000 to 300,000 barrels a day. So we are seeing continued strength and opportunity there. We certainly have the dock capacity to be able to manage that increase and we're looking forward to that optimization as we roll into 2Q and beyond. \nRoger Read: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: Good morning, guys and very clear from you Mike. My question here is, you did not need a partner at your Martinez facility. You obviously have a lot of cash. So -- but you did seek a partner and help us understand why you picked Neste. Why do you think they're your right partner? And how does this JV develop forward with Neste?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Manav, this is Mike. Thanks for the comment. When we started this project out, we were very open that there were four parameters that we felt would make a very strong project; competitive CapEx, competitive OpEx, strong logistics, and then ultimately feedstocks. And for a while there we had disclosed where we stood on CapEx and OpEx and logistics, but we had not reached conclusion with Neste. So part of our thinking all along has been, over the long term, not just in the short term that we believed that the partnership between us will hit both of our strengths. They bring a lot to the table with respect to feedstocks. Obviously, we're in that market as well, but we think there's a synergistic effect from their participation. And then, at the same time, as you think about it going forward, we feel really good about capital discipline being an important part of our portfolio and having them come in at the numbers that we've already publicly disclosed was a real good win for us and a real good win for Neste as well. So, we're excited about it, Manav. I will tell you that we're talking about a lot of other stuff together. I think the two parties together can create more value together and we're going to continue to try and see if we can do that.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up here is, you guys mentioned some of the reasons Gulf Coast was a little weaker. Your Mid-Con assets are very strong and that capture was also slightly weaker. Help us understand what happened during the quarter? And what I'm really trying to get to is, if you look at the cracks and we look at your historical capture rate and we go back to that in 2Q, you could have a massive 2Q Mid-Con earnings. So help us understand some of the reasons 1Q was a little weaker on capture in Mid-Con region. Thank you, so much.\nMaryann Mannen: Manav, it's Maryanne. So, maybe just sort of overall, when we think about the capture and then I'll come back to Mid-Con just in general. A couple of elements that really impacted our quarter and that largely our light product and secondary product margins narrowed during the quarter. That's typical as you know in a rising price environment. And then obviously, secondary product margins certainly in this price environment as well. We also have some inventory build in the quarter. And then of course, we use certain derivatives that -- to manage that price volatility. So, there are a few things really that impacted the quarter. Mid-Con was a bit stronger than it was in the first quarter than -- excuse me the second quarter. But that's really a key driver as we look at the capture rate overall for the quarter.\nMike Hennigan: Manav, it's Mike. I'm just going to add, everybody puts a lot of emphasis on capture and everybody knows I'm not the biggest fan of that metric for a lot of the reasons that -- you start to see the volatility that happens in the quarter can down sit around a little bit. And often, we're asked the question, should we plan on about 100% capture. And one of the things I think people should keep in mind is, we're in a different environment than I'll call it normal. If crude was $70 or so somewhere in that range, the impact of secondary products would be a lot different than it crude is at $100, $110 et cetera. So, I think you've got to keep that in mind, when you look at that particular metric. Those factors come into play. Brian mentioned earlier backwardation to Doug's question on the Colonial pipeline, I mean we're seeing some very unusual times, where we're in the -- at the start of the gasoline season, yet we're seeing extreme volatility with distillate cracks where they are, backwardation where it is on the distillate side of the equation. So, all those things come into play and hit that metric. So, I'm always leery, it bounces to one number, but there's a lot of inputs to come in and out to make that number what it is.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Prashant Rao from Citigroup.\nPrashant Rao: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. My first one. I wanted to ask on the crude side. Given all the shifts going on and as Russian product moves out of the market, I was curious about how the changes in feedstock availability might affect product deals. And asking that question really in the context of previous questions that have been asked already on this call, about capturing strong distillate crack. But also, when you think going forward, gasoline demand picking up into the summer driving season and how you balance max distillate versus max gasoline production, the impact that any feedstock availability changes could have on that? And maybe how that plays out or through the rest of the year if you kind of play the tape forward?\nMike Hennigan: Rick, do you want to start with the crude outlook?\nRick Hessling: Sure Mike. Yeah, Prashant. So it's an excellent question. There's a lot of moving parts in the world right now, especially around feedstocks. From our perspective though when you look at our PADD II, our PADD II and PADD V presence and the avails that we have at our fingertips, we uniquely have not seen that big of a shift in the avails that would directly affect yields, meaning we're able to get whatever Brian Partee and the marketing team are ordering up. So I'll state that as one. And two other items probably to call out related to feedstocks, Prashant is as you know we are a small. We were a small buyer of Russian crudes. And unless some of our peers, we feel that's a competitive advantage especially in this environment. So with our small presence in that Russian crude category, we have seen very, very little impact. And then lastly just to call out to the SPR release because that is incremental to the feedstock market. A couple of things on that front, we applaud the US government being proactive and for really taking quick action in a meaningful way for a prolonged period of time. We believe that will help not only the US consumer but us as buyers of feedstock. And MPC stand to be in a good position from the releases as we have two of our largest assets in Garyville and GBR really in the backyard of the SPR caverns. So I hope that gives you some color on the feedstocks front. I'll toss it over to Brian for any comments on yields and products.\nBrian Partee: Thanks Rick. Yeah. So Prashant just a couple of comments as we think about the gas and distillate dynamic playing out currently. So we're, obviously, at extreme levels. But at the end of the day this is very much a normal operations environment for us as we think about value chain optimization. So whether there's a penny or a dollar differential between gas distillate yet any of the other core products we're constantly optimizing across our plan as we look out forward as we look within the month, within the week, within the day. And ultimately we're running the system to meet the demands of the market. Clearly in this environment the market is sending us a really strong signal for more distillate. Ray mentioned earlier about our distillate hydrotreater running them in max mode. That's to capture the current market structure. We do expect to see a seasonal call on demand as we look forward to the summer driving season as we would typically expect. It's not really present in the market now if you look at the market structure because we're so strong here in the prompt on distillate. But we do expect that to manifest here as we roll into the summer months. But we're constantly optimizing and I just wanted to make that point clear that it feels very normal for our teams to be doing what they're doing to optimize to meet the market demand.\nPrashant Rao: Excellent. Thank you both for your answer. A quick follow-up probably for Maryanne. On working cap, overall positive in the quarter. It's pretty volatile. And I think most of us CMG inventories would be a bit of a headwind as you've called out. I was just wondering if you could give some color on how the components within that total working cap bridge shook out in R&M specifically. And then based on your quarter-to-date and current expectations, would it be reasonable to expect working cap at R&M to start to -- or the overall working cap to continue to be a tailwind as we go forward? \nMaryann Mannen: Yes, Prashant. Maryanne, thanks for the question. So as you said working capital in the quarter clearly was a source of cash particularly as we saw crude prices rising. We typically say that each dollar move in the oil price is about a $55 million impact to our working capital, right? So in a rising price environment. You already stated it, we did have some inventory impacts we would expect that not to be repeating in the second quarter when I see inventory impacts our inventory build. One of the other implications as we see prices rising quickly, sometimes it has implications in the receivables because it's not moving as fast as the payable. But in general, it's about a net 20-day payable position. So as long as prices stay where they are, we would continue to see working capital in the second quarter as the tailwind. Obviously, it would reverse as pricing would change.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. \nPhil Gresh: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask one follow-up on the buybacks, a slightly different way. The first $10 billion had a big component of Speedway proceeds associated with it and you've obviously extended it now to the $15 billion. The second quarter run rate continues to be at a very high level. And I'm just thinking, as we move forward and we lap the Speedway proceeds component of this. Is there a way you're looking at the more normalized level, of return of capital some kind of framework percent of cash flow or management to some kind of minimum cash balance. Obviously, you still have a lot of cash in the balance sheet. So I'm just trying to think through the moving pieces there. \nMaryann Mannen: Yes, certainly. It's Maryann. So, you're right. We've got a $15 billion authorization in total right? So about $7.5 billion remaining. We stay very focused on that commitment. As you know we shared with you $10 billion, no later than the end of this year. But based on this pace I shared right, we should be complete with that here in the second quarter and working through our $5 billion secondary or second repurchase authorization. With respect to our plans going forward, we're certainly looking at a series of things that we would share with you around how we would think about in a more normalized balance sheet, as we get to that position post right using the proceeds from the Speedway sale. As you know, cash is fungible and we certainly think about it in that way. But we are looking at a series of things as we talk about our capital allocation and would expect to come back to you, with how we would allocate cash between share repurchase, dividend obviously, our growth capital along our lines of our capital allocation framework shared previously. \nMike Hennigan: Phil, it's Mike. I just want to add that I've said many times that this business is predominantly a return of capital business and a return on capital business. And it's up to us to look at the opportunities that we have from a capital standpoint. I hope the market realizes that we're going to stay very disciplined, looking for solid returns, but we do want to grow earnings. But at the same time, we feel strongly that return of capital is a major component of what we're trying to accomplish here.\nPhil Gresh: Sure. Is there a minimum cash balance Maryanne, at these types of oil price levels you're thinking about? Has there been any adjustment to that thinking? \nMaryann Mannen: Yes. We -- I think we shared previously about $1 billion is where we feel comfortable. We've looked at a lot of scenario planning. We had a lot of experience as we looked at sort of some of the toughest volatility and liquidity periods during the pandemic. At one point in time, we had initially talked about potentially holding another $1 billion, but we're comfortable right now that $1 billion should be sufficient for us going forward.\nPhil Gresh: Got it. My follow-up is just on R&D fundamentals in particular LCFS prices. We've continued to see some pressure there. A lot of moving pieces on the deficit versus the credits but just any thoughts that you guys have if you kind of dug into this dynamic. \nBrian Partee : Yes, Phil, this is Brian. I'm happy to take that one. So, yes, you're probably looking at the Q4 car release late last week on the overall bank and certainly in Q4 with a tremendous build almost one million credits. The bank is at a pretty high level on the heels of slower demand in Q4 versus Q3 out in the West Coast. So, overall, demand was off about 6%. RD production in imports was up about 9%. So the total pool right now out in the West Coast you're looking at about 8% Bio, 30% R&D. And then the last factor driving the dynamics in the prompt is certainly the electric credit generation, which was up about 5% quarter-on-quarter. Now all that being said, you do have new programs coming into the market Oregon and Washington and Canada. We expect these to exert counter pressure over time to be a different placement option and alternative versus California. But that being said, Carbon is very committed to the program and having a workable program. In the very prompt at the end of the day LCFS is proportionally one of the smaller value drivers in the overall proposition if you think about the D4 value in the BTC and current D4 values in the $1.70 to $1.80 range really are helping to underpin the overall economics. It's a bit ironic if you think about the current environment with eggs and commodities flying up. At the same time, we have low LCFS pricing. We're in that operating environment with Dickinson right now and we're quite happy with what we're seeing on the return side, out of our production out of Dickinson. So I think it bodes well for the resiliency the through-cycle resiliency for RD over the long-term. \nPhil Gresh: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan : Hey, Brian, Bill that was a pretty good recap for Brian. I'll just add a few points. When we look at renewable diesel, there's -- it's a multivariable equation. There's really four regulatory drivers and Brian talked about a lot of them, along with the flat price or the renewable diesel on the feedstock price. So we're trying to optimize every day at Dickinson today to maximize profitability. I will say the biggest thing that we found success in at Dickinson will take forward to Martinez as the optionality on the feedstock, the ability to pivot to the feedstock that makes the most sense for us. And we've -- at Dickinson we have pre-treatment capabilities off-site that allow us to do that at Martinez that's part of the base CapEx for that plan. So you're right, right now LCFS pressure on that, but there's a lot of things that are within our control that we'll work to optimize. \nPhil Gresh: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. \nPaul Cheng: Hi. Good morning everyone. First, I might wish you a speed in through recovery after your treatment. And also Maryann, I just want to make a request if possible. Some of your larger customers by Exxon share fund they start disclosing the timing the timing benefit or the timing malls. We need to develop different inventory in the presentation or press release in each quarter. So I think all your investors will be grateful here. That's something that you guys will consider. \nMaryann Mannen: Paul, I apologize. Your line is cutting in and out a little bit for us here. Unfortunately, we weren't able to hear that. I did hear you say something that said investors would like to see something in our financials. So maybe we could take that one off-line. And then, if you send us a note. But just so you know just go a little slower because your line is cutting in and out with your question.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Can you hear me okay now?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes, that's better Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. So let me just repeat my request and I'm saying some of your larger customer Exxon, Shell. They've been disclosing the timing impact from derivative and inventory in their press release. And I think your investors will appreciate that if you guys consider providing those information. And in terms of...\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Paul. It's Maryann. I'm sorry. I apologize. Please finish your question sorry.\nPaul Cheng: Sure. No my question is on three-fold. One when we -- some of your -- one of your competitors has said when the product market is in backwardation that will also impact the margin capture or your ability to realize the pricing on the product screen. So just want to see that how that impact in your system when we are seeing in a backwardation curve. And also that some of your competitors seems like they all have three large inventory or derivative timing losses in the quarter. So Maryanne, you also mentioned that you have some of them. Can you quantify it? Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: Paul, it's Mike. First off, thank you for your comment. It's a multipart question. So I'm going to start and I'll let Brian talk a little bit about structure, but I'm going to repeat a little bit of what I said earlier right? I know everybody likes that metric of capture and if it wasn't for Kristina, I probably would not be a fan of putting it out there, but she keeps saying how important it is for everybody to see that metric. But there are so many things that play into that and one that doesn't normally occur to the extent that it's occurring now is the structure. And the backwardation that we've seen I mean if you look at the screen right now on distillate, since we've talked a lot about distillate, month one to month two backwardation is pretty strong, especially for this time of year. We would never normally think along those lines. So that comes into play as we're moving products and I'll let Brian talk a little bit about it. He mentioned it earlier, as far as a prompt barrel versus something that's got to travel on Colonial. And then Mayor mentioned earlier too is as flat price gets higher and higher you end up with this phenomenon where secondary products don't keep pace with flat price of crude and you end up with an impact there as well. So there's a lot of things hitting. And in this quarter particularly, as Doug mentioned earlier, it's a pretty volatile quarter. January versus February versus March was pretty sizable in volatility as to what we are seeing in the market. So anyway, let me let Brian make a comment towards structure. If you want to add there, Brian?\nBrian Partee: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Happy to jump in. Yeah, there's two key elements the way I think about market structure, Paul, to your question. So the first and Mike alluded to this is really in a rising price environment which is the phenomenon that we largely saw in the first quarter. So in a rising price environment, we do see compression. We often call it out obviously in the secondary products, but it's also prevalent in the primary. So the racks effectively do not move up as efficient in a very short period of time. Now they catch up over time. And then you do enjoy the benefit on the back end of that as prices come off they'll go slower. So that's one dynamic timing element. Specific to backwardation though, with the pronounced backwardation in the marketplace here today, the way I think about it, it's effectively transit time. So from the outside looking in, you look at market price point today and I think the way most people run their models is they assume a ratable operation. And that's just not how our system or anybody else's system works. There's transit times, and moving barrels to market, whether they're going on a truck or a pipe or rail, it really doesn't matter. And in a backward market, if you're looking at a ratable program at $2 today and the market has fallen off $0.50 by the time you get it to the market, your actual realization is going to be less. So in that environment, the obvious signal is to sell in the prompt and to not sell out on the curve. And that's really the phenomenon that's been playing out in the marketplace today, particularly on distillate as there's been steep backwardation and a big call to sell more in the problem.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Connor Lynagh from Morgan Stanley.\nConnor Lynagh: Yeah. Thank you. Obviously, sustainability of the current environment is a question that most people are struggling with right now, sort of two parts to this question, but I'm going to ask them both at once here. So on the first side, there's obviously been significant disruptions in crude and product markets from events in Russia and Ukraine. Do you feel that what's happening, particularly in distillate markets is directly a result of that, or do you feel that there is a broader issue at play here in either the refinery system inability to raise runs, or substantially higher demand than expected. But the second part of that is, as we move into the summer months, the expectations are that you'll continue to see upward pressure on demand. Do you guys have any concerns, or do you have any sort of framework for thinking about demand destruction? Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Connor, it's Mike. I'll start. First, to your point, geopolitical events always have an impact on supply and demand in the energy markets, and we're seeing it now in the current situation with Russia and Ukraine. But if you go back in time, much all geopolitical events tend to have some impact to energy. So that's an ongoing thing. The point you made about sustainability that's kind of in parallel to what's happening as well. So people are starting to think about, how do they position the portfolios as we have and put out their goals in sustainability. We're very proud. We think we're leading in that area in certain regards. And at the same time that we're trying to supply the market because, obviously, it's a very tight inventory situation. And as Ray mentioned earlier, we're pushing back some turnarounds. We're trying to maximize production as best we can in the short term. So I mean, at the end of all this counter, my word to the team all the time is, let's worry about what we can control. There's a lot of things out there that, we don't control and we stay attuned to them, but we try and bring it back to what we do control. And in the short term, what we do control is trying to maximize production into the marketplace. And that's what Ray and the team are trying to do.\nConnor Lynagh: And then just on the second part of that there, on a risk demand destruction. Are you guys seeing any evidence of that based on your interaction with customers or anything like that, or is there a price at which you think that certain areas of the economy can tolerate the product pricing?\nMike Hennigan: Yeah. Brian, do you want to take that?\nBrian Partee: Yeah, sure, Mike. Yeah. So Connor, maybe a couple of comments to build upon what Mike just stated. There is some fundamental support and premium in the marketplace right now, but there's also a degree of uncertainty premium based on what's going on over in the Ukraine. So I wanted to make that point that there's two things that are I think moving the market. One is just the pure fundamentals and I'll get into that in a minute. But there is a uncertainty premium right now that's penetrating the market. From an overall macro perspective though, the outlook is this. We've got really four positives working for us or tailwind. We've got the demand recovery upside coming out of COVID predominantly on gas and jet. We've got very low inventory positions both in the US and around the globe. And then we also have delayed turnaround and major maintenance on a lot of the refining system both domestically and internationally. That too will pressure utilization over the cycle here. And then also as you think about some of the closures that we've had during COVID that also is providing fundamental support to this current market dynamic. Now on the other side of that there's three, I'll call them uncertainties, new additions to refining capacity as an example. I think with supply chain disruptions, labor disruptions, the disruption economically during COVID there's a little bit more uncertainty on new addition refining capacity coming into the marketplace. I mentioned the Russian-Ukraine situation, but that's likely to pull some supply away from the market more so than the other. And then the last thing that's a bit of uncertainty and maybe specifically to your question is the global economic outlook. And certainly whether it's fuel pricing or any goods and services we've had very broad inflation and that's something that we're keeping a watchful eye on and watching the demand dynamics. But all that being said, we think there's right now a slight balance between the headwinds and tailwinds, and it's really difficult to tell which way the market is going to break. But at this 10 seconds it feels like we're pretty balanced and more optimistic than not as we look forward through the next quarter and beyond on overall demand. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Theresa Chen from Barclays. \nTheresa Chen: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. First I wanted to revisit the discussion on regional balances product shifts and the general tightness in Pad 1. I believe years ago you had underwritten some pipeline expansions to move product from the Mid-Con two Pad 1 from that Eastern Ohio market eastward. And at the time, I believe it was a seasonal movement. I was just wondering given the structural tightness that we're seeing PAD1 going forward, is there an ability to eke out additional capacity along that quarter to potentially see additional tailwinds for Mid-Con capture? \nMike Hennigan: Brian, you want to take that? \nBrian Partee: Yes, happy to Mike. Yes. Theresa to answer your question there's been a number of pipelines in that quarter that traditionally flowed out of the  into the Mid-Con that has since been reversed. And there's been some incremental capacity added here in the last year that also is helping to facilitate that move and ourselves as well as the broader market are definitely taking advantage of that capacity. The ARB is effectively wide open in the current market dynamics today to translate barrels into Western and Central Pennsylvania. We also see actually trucking opportunities. If you think about our position in Eastern Ohio to truck into the pad as far into Western New York as an example for some specialty grades. So yes, the market is working, the market is efficient and we are finding more and more opportunities to move that way. \nTheresa Chen: Thank you. And shifting to the Martinez project, I just wanted to clarify how the JV agreement works in terms of feedstock procurement. Will it be done independently between the two partners or together? And can you just explain more about the synergistic aspects of feedstock procurement there? And also Maryanne, if you could provide how much capital has been spent out of the $700 million budgeted for this year to date? \nMike Hennigan: Theresa, it's Mike. On the feedstock question, what we said last time is we're going to provide more color on the dynamics around the feedstock and who does what et cetera. But we want to wait until we get the JV closed. We're hoping that is very shortly. As Ray mentioned, we're very close on the permitting side. And then assuming that follows through then we'll get to close JV. And at that time we'll give a little bit more color on the feedstock dynamics.\nMaryann Mannen: Theresa, it's Maryann. So to answer your second question I think on the allocation of capital and how it's been spent on the $1.2 billion to date. So in 2021, we've spent roughly just under $300 million that's in 2021. If you look at 2022 in our capital plan, we estimated roughly $700 million in total. So again, depending on how all that project gets outlined for 2022. We would expect roughly half of that. So MPC would have about $350 million of that $700 million in Neste the balance obviously at $350 million. And then obviously that would give us about $200 million plus or minus remaining to complete the project in 2023.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Jason Gabelman from Cowen. \nJason Gabelman: Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to clarify a statement made earlier just about the backwardation impacts to your margin just the diesel backwardation that you're seeing. Was the point there that on a lot of your barrels that you're actually not receiving the diesel price that we see in the prop month but it's actually the diesel price in the month ahead? And if so, kind of what percentage of your product is exposed to that? And then my second question on the Neste joint venture, you mentioned that there's potential opportunities to grow in the future. And I wonder, if MPC would be open to participating in renewable diesel plants or other biofuel endeavors outside of the US or if your focus is just within the country. Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Brian do you want to start and I'll fish up.\nBrian Partee: Yes. Sure. Yes. Jason as a point of clarification on the backwardation. It's really dependent on the mode of delivery. So it's really about \u2013 I made the comment on the cycle time or delivery cycle time. So it's different depending on each market. Have an export as an example has a very long delivery cycle versus a spot sale. And I'll leave it at that. I won't go into the particulars of the percentage of our book and what they're under but it's \u2013 every mode of delivery is different. \nMike Hennigan: Jason it's Mike. I would just add, obviously as sellers were trying to maximize the pump and as buyers people are trying to buy down the curve as a general rule. So you have that yin and yang going on. And like Brian said, every situation is unique. But backward markets tell you that you have tight inventories. That's ultimately what backwardation is all about. It says that inventories are tight and product availability is tight. With respect to your second question, yeah, we're not going to speculate out in time with Neste, but I will tell you that the effort to get to this partnership was long. And the team, Dave Heppner headed it up inside our shop here and worked with the Neste Group for a long period of time. And one of the biggest things that I believe is, important as a result of it was the mutual respect each company have for each other and common goals that were setting for each other. So I think it is a nice platform for us to continue to look for ways that we can do business together. And that was really important for us as we were working through this, very similar to when we've entered other partnerships. One of the things that's, most important to us is, will the partnership endure the test of time. JVs are difficult in general, and you need to be really comfortable at the start of a JV that you feel that you have the right partner. And we feel that way with Neste with respect to Martinez.\nJason Gabelman: Great. Thanks for the answer.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call back to the speakers, for closing remarks.\nKristina Kazarian: Thank you for your interest in Marathon today. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics that were discussed this morning, please reach out and the team will be available to take your calls. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Sure. Thanks for the question, Neil. As we've said before, our 2022 turnaround plan was back-end loaded. So you shouldn't look at the first two quarters of the year and extrapolate the spend for the later quarters. But with current demands, we are really seeking to maximize our refining system as indicated by the second quarter guidance. What this really means Neil is that we've looked at some fixed bed catalyst changes that we had planned for the second quarter. We've determined we have a little bit as far as catalyst activity. So we've deferred that out later in the year. So our plan right now is to run really, really full -- run really hard during gasoline season this year. Sure Doug. Let me take your question as far as distillate production. The answer is absolutely yes. We're working right now to maximize distillate production across our system. Just to give you a little more color on that that's something that we look at daily make sure that we're maximizing the total recoverable distillate, the endpoint and maximizing the front end of the distillate. And then the real thing is just looking at our distillate hydrotreater across the system are full. And so we're doing that across our system. It depends on the toolkit from refinery-to-refinery as far as what that percentage is Gary, but would be the highest since it has a hydrocracker distal hydrotreaters, but whether we have on distillate hydrotreater or three, we're working to maximize across the system."

            "name": "Brian Partee",
            "content": "Yeah, sure Mike. Yeah. So, great question Doug. So, yeah, we definitely see the same dynamic that you're seeing. One of the factors that we look at in shipping barrels all the way up to New York Harbor is the market structure as well. So we've had a really, really strong run up here in the prompt on the front end of the cycle. So that's kind of the bid-ask dynamic ongoing right now with buyers and sellers is the sustainability of that. It certainly is starting to feel a lot more sticky as we look at imports coming into the New York Harbor starting to back off. But in the Gulf Coast, we also have really good placement opportunities not only our book but just across the overall complex, is there's more barrels being demanded in Central and South America. So, I would categorize it Doug is we're in a very, very acute pinch point here in the short-term over those market dynamics. But I think you're reading the tea leaves right as you look forward and think about less Russian exports and European complex starting to find a way to rebalance, the New York Harbor market is one that we expect to be impacted more so than other markets. And as you think about the connectivity via pipe in the Gulf Coast, we do look at that as a forward opportunity more structural and longer term. Yes. Sure, Mike. Yes. So, Roger, in the prompt, no not really. We're not seeing any fundamental shifts on the West Coast or the Pacific Basin. We, of course, continue to watch very closely at the lockdowns happening over in Asia. But they seem to be moving through a bit quicker than expected. I mean, we've all learned to deal with COVID a little bit differently than we did two years ago. So we're not seeing anything in the prompt. But I might maybe just back up and give you some perspective on exports more broadly, I think, it might be helpful, especially on the front end of the diesel strength that we see across the market. I mean, one of the key drivers obviously is recovery in jet demand. We're seeing that domestically and also around the world. The other thing that doesn't get a lot of discussion in the prompt is. Recall back in 2020, we were moving into IMO and different marine fueling. And that did take place. So there's a new call on demand on the distillate pool from MGO that we believe is also pulling on the distillate pool. But from an overall perspective, as we look at our export program, predominantly on the Gulf Coast, we do have some limited exports out of the West Coast. As we exited the first quarter, we were about 200,000 barrels a day of exports from the Gulf Coast, primarily into Latin and South America. But we did move barrels into Europe and we see that as an increasing opportunity for us going forward. And as we look at the forward book here into 2Q, we're moving from a 200,000 barrel a day-ish program to more in the 250,000 to 300,000 barrels a day. So we are seeing continued strength and opportunity there. We certainly have the dock capacity to be able to manage that increase and we're looking forward to that optimization as we roll into 2Q and beyond. Thanks Rick. Yeah. So Prashant just a couple of comments as we think about the gas and distillate dynamic playing out currently. So we're, obviously, at extreme levels. But at the end of the day this is very much a normal operations environment for us as we think about value chain optimization. So whether there's a penny or a dollar differential between gas distillate yet any of the other core products we're constantly optimizing across our plan as we look out forward as we look within the month, within the week, within the day. And ultimately we're running the system to meet the demands of the market. Clearly in this environment the market is sending us a really strong signal for more distillate. Ray mentioned earlier about our distillate hydrotreater running them in max mode. That's to capture the current market structure. We do expect to see a seasonal call on demand as we look forward to the summer driving season as we would typically expect. It's not really present in the market now if you look at the market structure because we're so strong here in the prompt on distillate. But we do expect that to manifest here as we roll into the summer months. But we're constantly optimizing and I just wanted to make that point clear that it feels very normal for our teams to be doing what they're doing to optimize to meet the market demand. Yes, Phil, this is Brian. I'm happy to take that one. So, yes, you're probably looking at the Q4 car release late last week on the overall bank and certainly in Q4 with a tremendous build almost one million credits. The bank is at a pretty high level on the heels of slower demand in Q4 versus Q3 out in the West Coast. So, overall, demand was off about 6%. RD production in imports was up about 9%. So the total pool right now out in the West Coast you're looking at about 8% Bio, 30% R&D. And then the last factor driving the dynamics in the prompt is certainly the electric credit generation, which was up about 5% quarter-on-quarter. Now all that being said, you do have new programs coming into the market Oregon and Washington and Canada. We expect these to exert counter pressure over time to be a different placement option and alternative versus California. But that being said, Carbon is very committed to the program and having a workable program. In the very prompt at the end of the day LCFS is proportionally one of the smaller value drivers in the overall proposition if you think about the D4 value in the BTC and current D4 values in the $1.70 to $1.80 range really are helping to underpin the overall economics. It's a bit ironic if you think about the current environment with eggs and commodities flying up. At the same time, we have low LCFS pricing. We're in that operating environment with Dickinson right now and we're quite happy with what we're seeing on the return side, out of our production out of Dickinson. So I think it bodes well for the resiliency the through-cycle resiliency for RD over the long-term. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Happy to jump in. Yeah, there's two key elements the way I think about market structure, Paul, to your question. So the first and Mike alluded to this is really in a rising price environment which is the phenomenon that we largely saw in the first quarter. So in a rising price environment, we do see compression. We often call it out obviously in the secondary products, but it's also prevalent in the primary. So the racks effectively do not move up as efficient in a very short period of time. Now they catch up over time. And then you do enjoy the benefit on the back end of that as prices come off they'll go slower. So that's one dynamic timing element. Specific to backwardation though, with the pronounced backwardation in the marketplace here today, the way I think about it, it's effectively transit time. So from the outside looking in, you look at market price point today and I think the way most people run their models is they assume a ratable operation. And that's just not how our system or anybody else's system works. There's transit times, and moving barrels to market, whether they're going on a truck or a pipe or rail, it really doesn't matter. And in a backward market, if you're looking at a ratable program at $2 today and the market has fallen off $0.50 by the time you get it to the market, your actual realization is going to be less. So in that environment, the obvious signal is to sell in the prompt and to not sell out on the curve. And that's really the phenomenon that's been playing out in the marketplace today, particularly on distillate as there's been steep backwardation and a big call to sell more in the problem. Yeah, sure, Mike. Yeah. So Connor, maybe a couple of comments to build upon what Mike just stated. There is some fundamental support and premium in the marketplace right now, but there's also a degree of uncertainty premium based on what's going on over in the Ukraine. So I wanted to make that point that there's two things that are I think moving the market. One is just the pure fundamentals and I'll get into that in a minute. But there is a uncertainty premium right now that's penetrating the market. From an overall macro perspective though, the outlook is this. We've got really four positives working for us or tailwind. We've got the demand recovery upside coming out of COVID predominantly on gas and jet. We've got very low inventory positions both in the US and around the globe. And then we also have delayed turnaround and major maintenance on a lot of the refining system both domestically and internationally. That too will pressure utilization over the cycle here. And then also as you think about some of the closures that we've had during COVID that also is providing fundamental support to this current market dynamic. Now on the other side of that there's three, I'll call them uncertainties, new additions to refining capacity as an example. I think with supply chain disruptions, labor disruptions, the disruption economically during COVID there's a little bit more uncertainty on new addition refining capacity coming into the marketplace. I mentioned the Russian-Ukraine situation, but that's likely to pull some supply away from the market more so than the other. And then the last thing that's a bit of uncertainty and maybe specifically to your question is the global economic outlook. And certainly whether it's fuel pricing or any goods and services we've had very broad inflation and that's something that we're keeping a watchful eye on and watching the demand dynamics. But all that being said, we think there's right now a slight balance between the headwinds and tailwinds, and it's really difficult to tell which way the market is going to break. But at this 10 seconds it feels like we're pretty balanced and more optimistic than not as we look forward through the next quarter and beyond on overall demand. Yes, happy to Mike. Yes. Theresa to answer your question there's been a number of pipelines in that quarter that traditionally flowed out of the  into the Mid-Con that has since been reversed. And there's been some incremental capacity added here in the last year that also is helping to facilitate that move and ourselves as well as the broader market are definitely taking advantage of that capacity. The ARB is effectively wide open in the current market dynamics today to translate barrels into Western and Central Pennsylvania. We also see actually trucking opportunities. If you think about our position in Eastern Ohio to truck into the pad as far into Western New York as an example for some specialty grades. So yes, the market is working, the market is efficient and we are finding more and more opportunities to move that way. Yes. Sure. Yes. Jason as a point of clarification on the backwardation. It's really dependent on the mode of delivery. So it's really about \u2013 I made the comment on the cycle time or delivery cycle time. So it's different depending on each market. Have an export as an example has a very long delivery cycle versus a spot sale. And I'll leave it at that. I won't go into the particulars of the percentage of our book and what they're under but it's \u2013 every mode of delivery is different."

            "content": "Sure Mike. Yeah, Prashant. So it's an excellent question. There's a lot of moving parts in the world right now, especially around feedstocks. From our perspective though when you look at our PADD II, our PADD II and PADD V presence and the avails that we have at our fingertips, we uniquely have not seen that big of a shift in the avails that would directly affect yields, meaning we're able to get whatever Brian Partee and the marketing team are ordering up. So I'll state that as one. And two other items probably to call out related to feedstocks, Prashant is as you know we are a small. We were a small buyer of Russian crudes. And unless some of our peers, we feel that's a competitive advantage especially in this environment. So with our small presence in that Russian crude category, we have seen very, very little impact. And then lastly just to call out to the SPR release because that is incremental to the feedstock market. A couple of things on that front, we applaud the US government being proactive and for really taking quick action in a meaningful way for a prolonged period of time. We believe that will help not only the US consumer but us as buyers of feedstock. And MPC stand to be in a good position from the releases as we have two of our largest assets in Garyville and GBR really in the backyard of the SPR caverns. So I hope that gives you some color on the feedstocks front. I'll toss it over to Brian for any comments on yields and products."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.49. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes was $1.9 billion, which is roughly in line with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we returned $330 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased approximately $2.8 billion in shares, which takes us to $2.5 billion repurchased, since our last earnings call. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA, as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially, driven primarily by $175 million decrease from refining and marketing. The tax rate for the quarter was 19%, which reflects the benefits from the public portion of MPLX net income which is not taxable to MPC. Moving to our segment results. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. The business reported strong first quarter earnings with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion. Utilization was 91% for the quarter. The sequential decline was driven by lower production, which was primarily the result of unplanned downtime in the US Gulf Coast, where we experienced two unplanned outages. In the beginning of February, the Galveston Bay refinery experienced a citywide power loss which resulted in a complete plant outage. Later in the month, as we were bringing our Garyville refinery back to service, following turnaround activities, a fire occurred near our hydrocracker unit. The unit was repaired and returned to service after about three weeks. Both of these events resulted in approximately $200 million of lost profit opportunity. Margin headwinds in the quarter were a result of the lower capture of 84% that we experienced this quarter and were primarily realized in the Gulf and West Coast.  Operating expenses were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to lower planned project expense as well as a lower average natural gas price coupled with lower energy consumption compared to the fourth quarter. Natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter, averaging over $0.70 in MMBtu higher in March than in January. In April, natural gas prices averaged $6.70 in MMBtu or nearly 80% higher than the average price in 2021.  The current forward strip for Henry Hub is around $8 for the rest of the year, so we would expect natural gas to be a headwind as the year progresses. Natural gas is an input cost for our refineries which historically has represented approximately 15% of our operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity is approximately $330 million of EBITDA for every $1 change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost. Distribution costs were lower in the first quarter due to lower product volumes. Turning to Slide 9. We want to directly address the refining and marketing capture this quarter. In the first quarter our capture result was 84%. A few factors drove the majority of the headwinds. Secondary and light product margins impacts associated with inventory builds and associated derivative views to manage volatility and to a lesser extent Gulf Coast refinery outages impacted our yields. Slide 10 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $1.9 billion in the quarter which excludes changes in working capital. Working capital was an approximate $600 million source of cash this quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude oil prices, partially offset by increases in crude and product inventory. In March MPLX issued $1.5 billion worth of long-term debt utilizing a large portion of the proceeds to repay the borrowings under the intercompany loan with MPC. During the quarter, MPC returned $330 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $2.8 billion worth of shares. Now 80% complete with our initial $10 billion capital return commitment, we could begin using the $5 billion incremental authorization starting in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $10.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Last week, we held our Annual General Meeting which concluded our proxy season, we appreciate the engagement from our investors as we work to create shareholder value, focus on sustainability and position ourselves to deliver results in an energy diverse future. Turning to guidance. On Slide 12, we provide our second quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.9 million barrels per day representing 95% utilization. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $155 million in the second quarter. Expected activity is relatively light and spread through all three regions. As Mike mentioned, our optimized turnaround schedule in the second quarter is expected to allow us to run our assets safely and reliably at high utilization as we remain focused on supplying the products and services markets are demanding. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel for the quarter. Earlier in the call, we shared our natural gas sensitivity the increase we are currently seeing for natural gas costs are reflected in our second quarter guidance, on top of our average baseline $5 per barrel of operating cost. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million. As we look at the impact of inflation on full year results the two areas of focus are wages and certain supply chain inputs. However, we have identified incremental sustainable cost reductions that we are executing against to offset these costs. Notwithstanding all of that, we will continue to identify the headwind from rising energy cost to our refining system throughout the year. Slide 13 provides our capital investment plan for 2022. Once we have closed on the Martinez JV. MPC will receive $400 million and be reimbursed for 50% of the capital spent to-date. After the JV is closed, MPC will be responsible for it's 50% share of the capital spend going forward and Neste will be responsible for its 50% share. The total cost for the Martinez refinery conversion is still expected to be $1.2 billion and MPC's net cost will be reduced to approximately $200 million. We will provide a more detailed update once we have closed the JV. As a reminder, ongoing growth projects in our Refining and Marketing segment will enhance the capability of our refining assets particularly in the Gulf Coast and also support our focus on growing the value recognized from our Marathon and Arco marketing brands. With that let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Hey Neil thanks. Yes. So, hopefully, you saw as we shared our capital allocation framework, we remain very committed to the dividend. As Mike just mentioned to you it's getting a tremendous amount of attention from the management team. It's on our conversations regularly with our Board. We recognize where the yield is. And certainly as we look at the strength particularly in the back half of the year, we'll expect to come back to you here in the very near future with our plans particularly as we are getting through our first round of share repurchase. So, you should expect us to be back to you here shortly on that. Yes, certainly Doug. So, for both the Galveston Bay unplanned outage due to the power issue and then again as we talked about Garyville, we've said it's roughly about $200 million in lost profit opportunity, right? ,So that we would have shared with you through the market indicator. I think the other issue there with both of those refineries being down is the fact that as you heard Ray talk about our ability to maximize. We lost the opportunity to increase yield there which obviously, as they come back online and have in the second quarter given the momentum assuming the macro holds as we expected will and cracks, we'll be able to recover that in the second quarter also. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Roger. So, no, you're correct. As I shared on the -- in my prepared remarks, if you look at the pace that we've been buying back, we would expect in the second quarter that we would begin to use that $5 billion authorization. In less than 12 months, we started our program in May of 2021. We've repurchased 80% or roughly $8 billion of our initial $10 billion commitment. If we look at that result through the end of the third quarter -- excuse me, the end of the first quarter. So we end at 331, we repurchased about 113 million shares at an average price of just less than $67 a share. We use part of our process. We use a mechanism that allows us to buy back through blackout periods. And during our quarterly buybacks, there's things that we will evaluate market conditions average daily trading volumes to be exact. So, we don't think anything that you maybe seeing in this quarter is indicative of a lack of commitment here by any means. And certainly, you look at the cash flow for the last several quarters strong and you look at the cash balance that I shared is you about $10.6 billion. So, hopefully that addresses your question. Manav, it's Maryanne. So, maybe just sort of overall, when we think about the capture and then I'll come back to Mid-Con just in general. A couple of elements that really impacted our quarter and that largely our light product and secondary product margins narrowed during the quarter. That's typical as you know in a rising price environment. And then obviously, secondary product margins certainly in this price environment as well. We also have some inventory build in the quarter. And then of course, we use certain derivatives that -- to manage that price volatility. So, there are a few things really that impacted the quarter. Mid-Con was a bit stronger than it was in the first quarter than -- excuse me the second quarter. But that's really a key driver as we look at the capture rate overall for the quarter. Yes, Prashant. Maryanne, thanks for the question. So as you said working capital in the quarter clearly was a source of cash particularly as we saw crude prices rising. We typically say that each dollar move in the oil price is about a $55 million impact to our working capital, right? So in a rising price environment. You already stated it, we did have some inventory impacts we would expect that not to be repeating in the second quarter when I see inventory impacts our inventory build. One of the other implications as we see prices rising quickly, sometimes it has implications in the receivables because it's not moving as fast as the payable. But in general, it's about a net 20-day payable position. So as long as prices stay where they are, we would continue to see working capital in the second quarter as the tailwind. Obviously, it would reverse as pricing would change. Yes, certainly. It's Maryann. So, you're right. We've got a $15 billion authorization in total right? So about $7.5 billion remaining. We stay very focused on that commitment. As you know we shared with you $10 billion, no later than the end of this year. But based on this pace I shared right, we should be complete with that here in the second quarter and working through our $5 billion secondary or second repurchase authorization. With respect to our plans going forward, we're certainly looking at a series of things that we would share with you around how we would think about in a more normalized balance sheet, as we get to that position post right using the proceeds from the Speedway sale. As you know, cash is fungible and we certainly think about it in that way. But we are looking at a series of things as we talk about our capital allocation and would expect to come back to you, with how we would allocate cash between share repurchase, dividend obviously, our growth capital along our lines of our capital allocation framework shared previously. Yes. We -- I think we shared previously about $1 billion is where we feel comfortable. We've looked at a lot of scenario planning. We had a lot of experience as we looked at sort of some of the toughest volatility and liquidity periods during the pandemic. At one point in time, we had initially talked about potentially holding another $1 billion, but we're comfortable right now that $1 billion should be sufficient for us going forward. Paul, I apologize. Your line is cutting in and out a little bit for us here. Unfortunately, we weren't able to hear that. I did hear you say something that said investors would like to see something in our financials. So maybe we could take that one off-line. And then, if you send us a note. But just so you know just go a little slower because your line is cutting in and out with your question. Yes, that's better Paul. Thanks, Paul. It's Maryann. I'm sorry. I apologize. Please finish your question sorry. Theresa, it's Maryann. So to answer your second question I think on the allocation of capital and how it's been spent on the $1.2 billion to date. So in 2021, we've spent roughly just under $300 million that's in 2021. If you look at 2022 in our capital plan, we estimated roughly $700 million in total. So again, depending on how all that project gets outlined for 2022. We would expect roughly half of that. So MPC would have about $350 million of that $700 million in Neste the balance obviously at $350 million. And then obviously that would give us about $200 million plus or minus remaining to complete the project in 2023."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks Kristina. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment. Year-over-year demand trends have been for the most part positive and the market seems to have reached a post-COVID point of stability. Distillate remains stable, jet continues to recover and gasoline has been more resilient than we would have expected given normal seasonality and recent geopolitical events. The biggest factor outside of our control is changes in global supply and demand. At the end of 2021, Global light product inventories were already tight. Sanctions and boycotts following the Russian invasion of Ukraine have increased supply uncertainties. Product margins have risen to cover the higher cost structure of marginal supply particularly in European regions where there's a high reliance on Russian natural gas. We expect continued volatility in 2022 with an advantage for safe, reliable and low-cost operators. We are focused on optimizing our maintenance schedules to maximize uptime and allow us to do what we can to produce volumes to meet the market demand. As we do this, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate. With this in mind, we anticipate the US refining system running at higher utilization rates in the coming quarters to meet rising demand. MPC's first quarter results reflect the continued recovery for our products and services, which supported higher margins and higher throughput across regions. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion. We repurchased $2.8 billion in shares in the quarter. And since our last earnings call we have repurchased $2.5 billion of shares. Through today we've completed 80% of our initial $10 billion capital return commitment. I would also like to highlight the strength of MPLX in our portfolio. Last year MPC received $2.2 billion of distributions from MPLX. As MPLX continues to generate free cash flow, we believe it will have the capacity to return significant cash to MPC and its public unitholders. Another milestone in our sustainability objectives was the joint venture agreement with Neste for the Martinez renewable fuels project. This strategic partnership with Neste enhances our Martinez project by leveraging our complementary strengths and expertise. The project will utilize existing process infrastructure, diverse inbound and outbound logistics and is optimally located to support California's LCFS goals, while strengthening MPC's footprint in renewable fuels. Our intended partnership with Neste also creates a platform for additional collaboration within renewables. We believe there will be opportunities to leverage this partnership between two industry leaders, as we pursue our shared commitment to the energy evolution and the goal of leading in sustainable energy. MPC will manage project execution and operate the facility once construction is complete. Additionally, MPLX Logistics assets support Martinez will remain owned and operated by MPLX. We are progressing through the permit process. Contra Costa County certified the Environmental Impact Report for the Martinez project and we're hopeful that the county will shortly provide final approval. We remain excited about the prospects of the project and its ability to deliver low carbon intensity fuels to support California's climate goals. Shifting to slide 5, we focus on challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. In February, we became the first among our peers to establish a 2030 target to reduce absolute Scope three greenhouse gas emissions by 15% below 2019 levels. The new Scope three target further enhances MPC's disclosures in addition to our existing Scope one and two reduction targets. MPLX also established a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity from natural gas gathering and processing operations by 75% below 2016 levels. In the second quarter, we will publish our annual sustainability and perspectives on climate-related scenarios reports and provide updates on the progress on the goals we have previously said. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann to review the first quarter results. It's a good question, Neil. Ray, do you want to take that? Yes. Thanks Neil. It's another good question and we talk about it a lot. I'll let Mary comment on it. Sorry Doug I wasn't clear. So, maybe what I was -- thank you for that ray. Maryann what I was really trying to get a handle on was if you could quantify in some way that lost opportunity costs from the first quarter? And what that momentum looks like as you go into the second quarter with the system back up possible? Brian, do you want to take that one? Good morning, Roger. Brian, do you want to take that? Yes, Manav, this is Mike. Thanks for the comment. When we started this project out, we were very open that there were four parameters that we felt would make a very strong project; competitive CapEx, competitive OpEx, strong logistics, and then ultimately feedstocks. And for a while there we had disclosed where we stood on CapEx and OpEx and logistics, but we had not reached conclusion with Neste. So part of our thinking all along has been, over the long term, not just in the short term that we believed that the partnership between us will hit both of our strengths. They bring a lot to the table with respect to feedstocks. Obviously, we're in that market as well, but we think there's a synergistic effect from their participation. And then, at the same time, as you think about it going forward, we feel really good about capital discipline being an important part of our portfolio and having them come in at the numbers that we've already publicly disclosed was a real good win for us and a real good win for Neste as well. So, we're excited about it, Manav. I will tell you that we're talking about a lot of other stuff together. I think the two parties together can create more value together and we're going to continue to try and see if we can do that. Manav, it's Mike. I'm just going to add, everybody puts a lot of emphasis on capture and everybody knows I'm not the biggest fan of that metric for a lot of the reasons that -- you start to see the volatility that happens in the quarter can down sit around a little bit. And often, we're asked the question, should we plan on about 100% capture. And one of the things I think people should keep in mind is, we're in a different environment than I'll call it normal. If crude was $70 or so somewhere in that range, the impact of secondary products would be a lot different than it crude is at $100, $110 et cetera. So, I think you've got to keep that in mind, when you look at that particular metric. Those factors come into play. Brian mentioned earlier backwardation to Doug's question on the Colonial pipeline, I mean we're seeing some very unusual times, where we're in the -- at the start of the gasoline season, yet we're seeing extreme volatility with distillate cracks where they are, backwardation where it is on the distillate side of the equation. So, all those things come into play and hit that metric. So, I'm always leery, it bounces to one number, but there's a lot of inputs to come in and out to make that number what it is. Rick, do you want to start with the crude outlook? Phil, it's Mike. I just want to add that I've said many times that this business is predominantly a return of capital business and a return on capital business. And it's up to us to look at the opportunities that we have from a capital standpoint. I hope the market realizes that we're going to stay very disciplined, looking for solid returns, but we do want to grow earnings. But at the same time, we feel strongly that return of capital is a major component of what we're trying to accomplish here. Hey, Brian, Bill that was a pretty good recap for Brian. I'll just add a few points. When we look at renewable diesel, there's -- it's a multivariable equation. There's really four regulatory drivers and Brian talked about a lot of them, along with the flat price or the renewable diesel on the feedstock price. So we're trying to optimize every day at Dickinson today to maximize profitability. I will say the biggest thing that we found success in at Dickinson will take forward to Martinez as the optionality on the feedstock, the ability to pivot to the feedstock that makes the most sense for us. And we've -- at Dickinson we have pre-treatment capabilities off-site that allow us to do that at Martinez that's part of the base CapEx for that plan. So you're right, right now LCFS pressure on that, but there's a lot of things that are within our control that we'll work to optimize. Paul, it's Mike. First off, thank you for your comment. It's a multipart question. So I'm going to start and I'll let Brian talk a little bit about structure, but I'm going to repeat a little bit of what I said earlier right? I know everybody likes that metric of capture and if it wasn't for Kristina, I probably would not be a fan of putting it out there, but she keeps saying how important it is for everybody to see that metric. But there are so many things that play into that and one that doesn't normally occur to the extent that it's occurring now is the structure. And the backwardation that we've seen I mean if you look at the screen right now on distillate, since we've talked a lot about distillate, month one to month two backwardation is pretty strong, especially for this time of year. We would never normally think along those lines. So that comes into play as we're moving products and I'll let Brian talk a little bit about it. He mentioned it earlier, as far as a prompt barrel versus something that's got to travel on Colonial. And then Mayor mentioned earlier too is as flat price gets higher and higher you end up with this phenomenon where secondary products don't keep pace with flat price of crude and you end up with an impact there as well. So there's a lot of things hitting. And in this quarter particularly, as Doug mentioned earlier, it's a pretty volatile quarter. January versus February versus March was pretty sizable in volatility as to what we are seeing in the market. So anyway, let me let Brian make a comment towards structure. If you want to add there, Brian? Connor, it's Mike. I'll start. First, to your point, geopolitical events always have an impact on supply and demand in the energy markets, and we're seeing it now in the current situation with Russia and Ukraine. But if you go back in time, much all geopolitical events tend to have some impact to energy. So that's an ongoing thing. The point you made about sustainability that's kind of in parallel to what's happening as well. So people are starting to think about, how do they position the portfolios as we have and put out their goals in sustainability. We're very proud. We think we're leading in that area in certain regards. And at the same time that we're trying to supply the market because, obviously, it's a very tight inventory situation. And as Ray mentioned earlier, we're pushing back some turnarounds. We're trying to maximize production as best we can in the short term. So I mean, at the end of all this counter, my word to the team all the time is, let's worry about what we can control. There's a lot of things out there that, we don't control and we stay attuned to them, but we try and bring it back to what we do control. And in the short term, what we do control is trying to maximize production into the marketplace. And that's what Ray and the team are trying to do. Yeah. Brian, do you want to take that? Brian, you want to take that? Theresa, it's Mike. On the feedstock question, what we said last time is we're going to provide more color on the dynamics around the feedstock and who does what et cetera. But we want to wait until we get the JV closed. We're hoping that is very shortly. As Ray mentioned, we're very close on the permitting side. And then assuming that follows through then we'll get to close JV. And at that time we'll give a little bit more color on the feedstock dynamics. Brian do you want to start and I'll fish up. Jason it's Mike. I would just add, obviously as sellers were trying to maximize the pump and as buyers people are trying to buy down the curve as a general rule. So you have that yin and yang going on. And like Brian said, every situation is unique. But backward markets tell you that you have tight inventories. That's ultimately what backwardation is all about. It says that inventories are tight and product availability is tight. With respect to your second question, yeah, we're not going to speculate out in time with Neste, but I will tell you that the effort to get to this partnership was long. And the team, Dave Heppner headed it up inside our shop here and worked with the Neste Group for a long period of time. And one of the biggest things that I believe is, important as a result of it was the mutual respect each company have for each other and common goals that were setting for each other. So I think it is a nice platform for us to continue to look for ways that we can do business together. And that was really important for us as we were working through this, very similar to when we've entered other partnerships. One of the things that's, most important to us is, will the partnership endure the test of time. JVs are difficult in general, and you need to be really comfortable at the start of a JV that you feel that you have the right partner. And we feel that way with Neste with respect to Martinez."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor cab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, President; John Quaid, CFO and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results could differ. Factors that cause actual results to differ are there as well as in our SEC filings. References to MPC Capital during the prepared remarks today reflects standalone MPC Capital, excluding MPLX. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. First, I\u2019d like to recognize some changes we made at our executive management level. Maryann Mannen has been appointed President of MPC. In this role, she will be responsible for our Refining & Marketing, Commercial and HES&S organizations. John Quaid, previously CFO of MPLX succeeds Maryann as CFO of MPC. In addition to these changes, Rick Hessling has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer. Rick will lead our global feedstock and clean products teams with the goal of maximizing margin capture across the entire value chain. Brian Partee has been appointed Chief Global Optimization Officer. Brian will be responsible for assessing and redefining business processes that are critical to improving our performance, including our value chain optimization efforts and determining investments needed to accelerate the delivery of results. At a high level, these organizational changes put more emphasis on advancing important value-creating initiatives, driving increased performance throughout our entire value chain and making a step change in our cash flow generation capability. Turning to our 2023 results. We are pleased to continue to deliver on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was over $14 billion on a consolidated basis, reflecting our team\u2019s strong execution. Our Refining & Marketing business delivered excellent full year results generating EBITDA of $12.74 per barrel of throughput and capture of 100%. These results reflect strong utilization of our assets and improved execution against our commercial strategy. Incremental to our Refining & Marketing results, our Midstream business posted nearly $6.2 billion of EBITDA. EBITDA for the Midstream segment grew by approximately 7% year-over-year or by approximately $400 million. We expect MPC will receive $2.2 billion of annual cash distributions supported by MPLX\u2019s most recent 10% increase to its quarterly distribution. MPLX is strategic to MPC\u2019s portfolio. Its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC\u2019s dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to increase its cash distribution as it pursues growth opportunities further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. We are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. In 2023, we returned $11.6 billion through share repurchases, bringing total repurchases to over $29 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC\u2019s quarterly dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. Over the past 5 years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of over 12%. For the full year 2023, this capital return represents a payout of 92% of our operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. Executing on our commitments, combined with a strong macro environment led to total shareholder returns of approximately 31% for MPC in 2023. Turning to our view on the refining macro environment as we head into 2024, global oil demand hit a record high in \u201823 and we see another year of record oil consumption in \u201824. The IEA is currently projecting demand growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day with their projections having been raised higher over the last 3 consecutive months. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Global supply remains constrained and anticipated global capacity additions have progressed slower than expectations. Gasoline and diesel inventories remained tight globally. And as we look into \u201824, we anticipate that above-average turnaround activity globally in the first quarter as well as the transition to summer gasoline blends will be supportive of refining margins. As we look further into 2024, we believe the U.S. refining industry will experience an enhanced mid-cycle environment due to global supply demand fundamentals and its relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include: first, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Second, our dividend. We are committed to paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We intend to evaluate the dividend at least annually. Third, growth capital. We will invest capital, but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. Beyond these three objectives, we will return excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. From May of \u201821 through January 2024, we reduced our total share count by approximately 45%, repurchasing approximately 300 million shares at an average price of $97. As we execute in 2024, we remain committed to share repurchases as a key component of our capital allocation priorities. MPC\u2019s standalone 2024 capital investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. Underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance, sustaining capital is approximately 35% of capital spend. In Refining & Marketing, gross spending is down nearly $200 million compared to 2023, reflecting strong capital discipline. In 2024, we are focused on investments that enhance margin and reduce costs. In low carbon, we are investing in an opportunity that offers an attractive return, lowers our cost, increases reliability and reduces emissions. This morning, MPLX also announced its 2024 capital investment plan of $1.1 billion, which is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. At this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks Mike. Solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. We believe the improvements we\u2019ve made to our cost structure, portfolio and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, irrespective of the market environment. We will continue to build on this strong foundation to recognize value throughout our business. Our refining utilization in 2023 was 92% as we operated our portfolio to meet consumer demand. Recently, we have said we believe our average capture over longer periods of time is approaching 100%. And in 2023, our full year capture was 100%. This commitment to commercial excellence is foundational and we expect to continue to see these results. While our capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics, we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years and expect to enhance further will provide a sustainable advantage. Turning to our operations. In the Gulf Coast, the Galveston Bay reformer repairs progressed as planned. We started the unit back up in mid-November and returned to full operating rates by mid-December. At our Martinez facility, we will be operating at approximately 22,000 barrels per day in the short-term. We have been working closely with the regulators to proceed with repairs to ensure safe and reliable operations. Let me move to Slide 7, which shows our capital investment plan for 2024 in a bit more detail. MPC\u2019s investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. The plan includes $1.2 billion for Refining & Marketing segments. Our growth capital plan is approximately $825 million between traditional projects and low carbon. We are investing primarily at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. Within traditional Refining & Marketing, $100 million is associated with a multiyear project to increase finished distillate yields at the Galveston Bay refinery. $375 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing yields at our refineries, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost as well as investments in our branded marketing footprint. Within low carbon, approximately $330 million is allocated to a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions and $20 million for smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Slide 8 provides an overview of the multiyear investment at our Los Angeles refinery. The Los Angeles refinery is the core asset in our West Coast value chain and is one of the most competitive refineries in the regions. This investment, once completed, is expected to further enhance its cost competitiveness by integrating and modernizing utility systems, which will improve reliability and increase energy efficiency. Additionally, a portion of this improvement addresses a new regulation mandating further reductions in emissions. This regulation applies to all Southern California refineries. The improvements are expected to be completed by the end of 2025. We expect to generate a return on our investment of approximately 20%. Turning to Slide 9. At Galveston Bay, we are investing to construct a 90,000 barrel per day high-pressure distillate hydrotreater. This project is planned to strengthen the competitiveness of the refinery through increased production of higher value finished products. Once in service, the new distillate hydrotreater will upgrade high sulfur distillate to ultra-low sulfur diesel, eliminating the need for third-party processing or sales into shrinking lower value high sulfur export market. This strategic investment ensures we provide the clean burning fuel of the world demand and further enhances the competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast value chain. The project is expected to be complete by year-end 2027 and generate a return of over 20%. Turning to our low carbon initiatives, we challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and fresh water intensity. Targets, which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible pathway to accomplish. In our 2024 capital outlook, we are investing to significantly lower energy intensity and emissions at Los Angeles, one of our largest refineries. Additionally, we are investing in smaller amounts of capital in early-stage developments like RNG which could significantly aid in greenhouse gas emission reductions in the future. Overall, we are taking disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture, while continuing to supply a growing and evolving market by safely operating our current asset base with the objective to deliver superior cash flow. Let me turn the call over to John.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Moving to fourth quarter highlights, Slide 11 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 for the fourth quarter and $23.63 for the full year. This quarter\u2019s results were adjusted to exclude the $0.14 per share net effect of three items, a $145 million LIFO inventory charge, $47 million of net recoveries related to MPLX\u2019s Garyville incident response, and a $92 million gain recognized by MPLX. Adjusted EBITDA was over $3.5 billion for the quarter and almost $19 billion for the year. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, was nearly $2.3 billion for the quarter and $13.9 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $311 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.5 billion of our shares. Slide 12 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter to fourth quarter of 2023 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.2 billion, driven by lower R&M margins. The tax rate for the quarter was 18%, reflecting the impacts of the MPLX structure and a discrete benefit largely related to state taxes. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be around 21%. Moving to our segment results. Slide 13 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the fourth quarter. Our 13 refineries ran at a 91% utilization, processing nearly 2.7 million barrels of crude per day. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower across all regions driven by lower crack spreads. Capture for the quarter was 122%. Refining operating costs were $5.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter, higher sequentially due to higher energy cost, particularly on the West Coast as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Slide 14 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture of 122% for the quarter. We ran well and our commercial teams executed effectively to deliver strong results. Capture this quarter benefited from late product margin tailwinds, in particular for jet fuel as well as less of a headwind from secondary product prices. Slide 15 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment delivered strong fourth quarter results. For the full year 2023, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 7% compared to the prior year. Our Midstream business is growing and generating strong cash flows as we advance high return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Slide 16 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $2.3 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining and Midstream businesses. Working capital was a $1.1 billion use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by declining crude prices. Cash from ops for the quarter was also impacted by a $320 million headwind from changes in our income tax receivable, which you might usually expect to see as a working capital change. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $896 million this quarter. This includes MPLX\u2019s acquisition of full ownership of a gathering and processing joint venture in the Delaware Basin for approximately $270 million. MPC returned $2.8 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximate 125% payout of the $2.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to deliver superior shareholder returns. As of January 26, we have approximately $5.9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And at the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $10.2 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash. Turning to guidance on Slide 17, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of almost 2.5 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 83%. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due mainly to higher turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $600 million. We are executing turnarounds at 4 of our largest refineries, Galveston Bay, Garyville, Los Angeles and Robinson, all in the first quarter when margins are typically lower to minimize the financial impact of these outages. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be similar to last year at around $1.3 billion. Operating costs in the first quarter are expected to be $5.85 per barrel higher sequentially due mainly to lower throughput volumes associated with the significant planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.45 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $185 million. And with that, let me pass it back to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, John. We\u2019ve delivered strong execution on our strategic commitments again this year. This includes running reliably with high utilization, structural improvements to our commercial performance, fostering a low cost culture and strengthening the competitive position of our assets. At MPLX, the partnership has continued to grow, increasing its cash flow and its cash distribution MPC. We have invested capital to grow earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. This has resulted in superior cash flow generation and supported the repurchase initiatives. Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets, and we will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. We believe our focus on safety, environmental, I\u2019m sorry, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment, which we expect to continue longer-term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. MPC\u2019s Midstream segment, consisting primarily of MPLX has grown EBITDA by $1.3 billion since 2019, which is a 6% compound annual growth rate over the last 4 years. As MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it\u2019s in a strong position to continue to consistently grow its distributions. As a result of MPLX increase against distribution 10% of reach in the last 2 years, and MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion of cash distribution, which reflects a $400 million increase since 2020. Each 10% distribution increase is approximately $200 million of additional cash flow that MPC receives through its ownership in the partnership. In summary, this year, we generated $14 billion of cash from operations. We increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $11.6 billion of shares, resulting in a 92% payout ratio. In 2023, MPC\u2019s total shareholder return was 31%. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior return to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. Sheila, we\u2019re ready.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, team. Thanks for doing this great quarter. The first question is really on Slide 14, and this is what we\u2019re getting from investors this morning, which is the 122% system capture and that $885 million of margin uplift. And I recognize there is some sensitivities about what you can say and can\u2019t say here. But just can you talk about what drove that strength? And how much of this feels one-timeish versus stuff we want to carry forward?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey, Neil, good morning. It\u2019s Maryann. Thanks for the question. So first and foremost, as you know, commercial performance has been and will continue to be a foundational pillar for us in terms of delivering outstanding execution and meeting the goals and objectives that Mike shared with you around delivering best through cycle cash flow throughout the cycles. In the quarter, we generated about 122% capture as we shared. Overall, as you know, we\u2019ve been talking about our ability to continue to drive toward 100%. Over the last couple of quarters, Rick and Brian have been sharing with you some of the key elements around structural changes that we believe are sustainable, and then Mike announced this morning a couple of other changes, which we think will continue to drive our ability to identify and deliver against that foundational principles. In the quarter, we had a couple of benefits that delivered the 122%. So first of all, strong light product margins and frankly, a more favorable secondary products impact. This is not abnormal for this period of time. Having said that, we also saw stronger jet fuel premiums to diesel and the benefit of diesel blending, excuse me, of butane blending in the quarter as well. To your question, how much of this is repeatable? Obviously, some of those things are not repeatable, particularly when we look at the sharper drop in crude oil and refined product prices. We also did have the ability of having, as I shared with you, our reformer at GVR and other benefits of projects that we completed fully operating in the quarter. So let me pause there and see if that helped to answer your question at all.\nNeil Mehta: That\u2019s great, Maryann it\u2019s a lot of good color there. The follow-up is just on Slide 17, sticking with the deck here, which is it does seem like a period of heavier turnaround in Q1, particularly in the West Coast region. Maybe talk about the decision around where you took maintenance, how that fits into the full year plan? And anything we should be thinking about as you approach this turnaround season?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Neil, it\u2019s Mike. Yes, I think we said in our prepared remarks that our turnaround spend this year is about the same as last year. But the way you should think about it is, as Maryann mentioned, in the first quarter, we\u2019re pretty heavy at four of our largest facilities, our largest financial generating facility. So we\u2019re taking advantage of the fact that margins are down in the first quarter. So we\u2019re spending $600 million in the first quarter, which is a high number, relative to the full year. And I know we don\u2019t traditionally give quarter-to-quarter, but I\u2019ll just tell you that next quarter, the turnaround number drops down to like $200 million or so, somewhere in that range. So we\u2019re being opportunistic in some regard. A lot of the activity does get planned, but at the same time, we want to take advantage of the fact that the margin environment now is constructive for us to be off-line so that when margins, we think, are going to be a lot stronger in the second quarter, we will have our four largest facilities turn around and ready to deliver results.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Mike.\nMike Hennigan: You are welcome, Neil.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: First of all, congrats guys. I know one of the goals was to get to 100% capture, although Mike always stays focused on EBITDA per barrel margin and free cash. I know one of the goals was to get to 100% capture. So congrats on overshooting that mark. My question here is on the two growth projects. Los Angeles. Some of the people out there are looking to exit the state given the tougher laws, you were actually going back and investing in this project. So help us understand what\u2019s driving that? And again, on the Galveston Bay moving from upgrading high sulfur to ULSD, what kind of realization uplift could you get if you do execute this project?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Manav, this is Mike. I\u2019ll start. First of all, thank you for the comment on capture. And as you said, it\u2019s not my favorite metric, but I\u2019m a big believer in how much cash are we generating, how much cash per share we\u2019re generating. And I want to lead in those categories is the metric that I spend the most time looking at. But, it does get some good indication, as Mary said, it\u2019s hard just to differentiate the question Neil asked between what\u2019s happening in the market? And what are some of the structural improvements that we\u2019ve implemented over the last couple of years here. But anyway, thanks for the comment. As far as our capital investment, I\u2019m hoping everybody sees a couple of things. One is, yes, we are investing in our L.A. facility. It\u2019s an area where we believe that we can put a decent amount of investment in there and really improve the competitiveness of that facility, but we already believe it\u2019s one of the top facilities on the West Coast. So it is an area that we want to invest in. Now that particular investment is about efficiency, reliability and lowering our costs. And to your point, being a very reliable supplier out there is an important part of the equation. The other project that we\u2019ve announced is a margin enhancement project. And in our view, things are not going to get easier for unhydrotreated distillate into the future. And if you look at the spreads today, even today, they are pretty wide. So at the end of the day, what\u2019s driving us the most in both of those, when we put this in the slides is we think both of these projects are north of 20% returns. And hopefully, we\u2019re conservative on that, but we think they are very good investments and again, in two of our largest, highest financial generating facilities. So one of the themes that you\u2019ve heard from us is we\u2019re going to invest in projects that we feel really strong about on a return basis, but they are also enhancing in competitive positions of some of our biggest facilities. And I think you\u2019ve heard the theme from us for a while here. It\u2019s margin enhancement, lower cost and efficiencies. And out on the West Coast, the other driver is there is emissions reductions goals that are going to occur over time, and this project will take care of that in a large way, and that\u2019s why we grouped it into our low-carbon area. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up here is you were looking to ramp towards the nameplate capacity at your renewable diesel project on the West Coast. If you can give us some update over there, how is that project progressing?\nMaryann Mannen: Certainly, it\u2019s Maryann. Currently, we are running at about 22,000 barrels a day versus our nameplate at 48,000. We\u2019re going to continue to run at that level as we work with the regulators to determine what repairs need to be complete in order to be able to get to that nameplate at 48,000. As we think about that, as you know, we\u2019ve got our JV partnership with Neste, so really, what we\u2019re looking at is the differential for MPC of about 13,000 barrels a day. So not meaningful to the 3 million-barrel system that we run. But again, running at 22,000 overall for the facility, and we will continue to work with our regulators to determine when we can bring it to full 48,000.\nManav Gupta: Thank you so much.\nMike Hennigan: You are welcome, Manav.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Securities. You may proceed.\nDoug Leggate: Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike, I hate to do this. So I wonder if I could try to capture a question in a slightly different way because we, I guess have a slightly different view of this. If you look at your system as more of an LP, we see a great deal of linearity between the indicator margin and what you\u2019re delivering. I think I agree with you. I think capture is a terrible metric to try and measure a linear program business, frankly. But what we do see, however, is that the mix of inputs seems to be changing some, which is allowing you to capture more of the margin. So my question is really that. What are you doing in your commercial business or operations that is changing the optimization of the slate that you\u2019re running in your system? Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts around crude in the U.S. right now with TMX and a few other things. Is that a factor?\nRick Hessling: Yes. Hi, Doug, this is Rick. So I\u2019ll take a stab at that. So we are significantly I would say every day, Doug, we are optimizing our slate. And we look at this regionally. We look at this by plant. But in the end, Doug, I think what we do better than others in the industry, is we optimize for the betterment of our total return at the end of the day. So we are not, we could suboptimize one plant for the benefit of another, and we have worked years, decades, as a matter of fact, to give ourselves optionality within our Mid-Con system. We are currently juggling optionality with TMX and our West Coast and Pacific Northwest system as well as we\u2019ve worked on it for quite a while on the Gulf Coast. So you are onto something from a crude slate perspective. It\u2019s constantly changing. We\u2019re constantly pushing the norm on what we should run, what crudes we look at, what assays we look at, updating our system. So this is just an ongoing exercise that\u2019s been happening now for several years now. And I\u2019ve said it before, we\u2019re unpacking everything from A to Z, Doug, we\u2019re leaving no rock unturned in terms of capturing value. And that not only goes certainly on the crude slate side, but it goes throughout our entire value chain.\nMike Hennigan: And Doug, it\u2019s Mike. I know it\u2019s been a source of frustration since we don\u2019t give a lot of detail in this area for competitive reasons. But to Rick\u2019s point, we\u2019ve made some changes. And to be honest with you, I\u2019m more excited about what\u2019s in the future for us. Brian\u2019s new role as Head of Global Optimization for us, I think, is going to make a step change for where we\u2019re going. So we\u2019ve had a lot of momentum in this area. It\u2019s showing up in the results. As we discussed, capture is not my favorite, but generating cash is. And at the end of the day, I think we have more opportunity in the whole area. If we run well and then deliver commercially, we will continue to generate cash and be a good source of return for shareholders.\nDoug Leggate: LPs are a complicated beast and you guys seem to have figured it out. So thank you for the answer, guys. My follow-up is probably for, it might be for Maryann. I\u2019m not sure. Congratulations to everyone on the new roles. But Maryann, if I look at Slide 21, you\u2019re showing your debt maturity profile at the MPC level. Obviously, sitting with a net cash position at the MPC level, what are your thoughts on where you want your balance sheet to be as those debt maturities come due?\nJohn Quaid: Hey, good morning, Doug, it\u2019s John. I\u2019ll go ahead and take that.\nDoug Leggate: I wasn\u2019t sure if you take or not. Thank you.\nJohn Quaid: No, no, not a problem at all. And I think you kind of \u2013 were hinting at it as you were getting there. We\u2019ve got a lot of financial flexibility right now. We\u2019re very comfortable with the gross amount of debt that MPC has but certainly have the balance sheet to be very thoughtful about the right timing of refinancing that debt and really optimizing our cost of capital and really that cost of debt. And I think longer-term, right, we\u2019ve laid out a target of kind of the gross debt to cap of 25% to 30%. We\u2019re a good bit away from that, but that\u2019s something we will continue to monitor as we look out into the future.\nDoug Leggate: And John, remind me, is that consolidated for MPLX or stand-alone?\nJohn Quaid: It\u2019s stand-alone.\nDoug Leggate: Okay, thank you.\nJohn Quaid: In a much different position, I can probably speak to that one pretty well just given the seat I was in before, or. You\u2019ve got a really stable company running at sub-3.5% leverage, but the cash flows there can probably support a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4x. Again, they have got some financial flexibility to be smart about what they are doing as well. So I think both balance sheets are in a really strong place.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nMike Hennigan: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Mike, I think in the past, you have shown that you are not really interested in acquisition of refining assets. But one may argue that, I mean, given how well you are running your facility, do you think that there is a value to be added to have some additional assets to your platform so you can apply your technical know-how to even a bigger profile. And also in the Gulf Coast, you have two huge refineries. If we add additional facility, would that further diversify and reduce the operating risk, having multiple facilities and also, frankly, that will perhaps even increased commercial and optimization opportunities. So just want to see that, I mean, how you guys look at that question internally?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Paul, first off, Dave Heppner\u2019s group is constantly looking at the market and what assets are available I always say I never say never. But in the meantime, while Dave is working on that side of the equation, we\u2019re also looking at the footprint we have and the assets we have. And that\u2019s part of the reason that we came out with the announcement today. Two of our key facilities, we think we can make a meaningful change. And we\u2019ve been more transparent than normal to try and explain to people. We think we got north of 20% return projects here on the assets that we own ourselves. So, there is always a balance call between, obviously, the assets you own, you know inside and out, whereas the ones you\u2019re evaluating externally, there is a little bit of concern from diligence, etcetera. But I will tell you, I think people know my DNA in general. But at the same time, Dave and his team are challenging where can we make investments that are outside of our portfolio. We haven\u2019t done a lot, as you mentioned on the refining side. But we have made some investments overcalling low carbon. We made some investments in some pretreat facilities on the low carbon side. We\u2019ve invested in an RNG facility. So Dave and his team are looking at both refining and outside of refining. And we just constantly talk about that and decide where do we think we want to put our capital. And for today, we\u2019re pleased to report that we think we have two pretty good projects. But the other part, let me just mention this one last thing because this is kind of important. On the slide where we talk about our capital, we say in traditional refining, we\u2019re investing $475 million. Maryann mentioned that $100 million of that is related to the DHT project, but $375 million of that is what we don\u2019t typically talk about on earnings calls. These are projects in all of our facilities that are higher returns, really good projects for us, but they don\u2019t have the sexy headline about them. But if you look at it, though, $375 million out of the $475 million in traditional are these smaller high-return projects. So, the team does a nice job. Tim and his organization are constantly looking for areas where we can make margin improvement, lower cost, increase reliability. As you said, this all starts with you got to run reliably, and then you got to be smart commercially. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that a little bit, and then we just try to invest capital to keep bolstering that equation. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color.\nPaul Cheng: Absolutely. Can I just go back into the commercial question? In the fourth quarter, you guys definitely done well in the [indiscernible]. And if we\u2019re looking at versus the margin capture of 100 additional 22%, is there a number that you can share how much of them is coming from the commercial side of the business that you have done really well? And that\u2019s why that you are seeing that much better in the capture. And also that I think in the past, you\u2019re saying that one of the maybe Holy Grail for commercial operations is that you will be able to optimize based on breakdown the [indiscernible] and optimized based on the total company. Where are we in that process? Do you think that you are already there or that you are just still stretching the surface on that process?\nMike Hennigan: Paul, I will start with the second part. As I have said, I will repeat myself a little bit, but we still think there is quite a ways to go where we can do better, and that was part of the reasoning behind the organizational change. Brian\u2019s role as global optimization lead is going to his team is going to work with the commercial guys with our refining guys. And you heard me say we define process, find places to invest, change what we are doing today. So, I think we have made a lot of progress. People always ask what inning or I guess it\u2019s football season, so what quarter are we in. And that\u2019s always hard to ascertain because I think we keep peeling the onion back and seeing that we can make another step change. So, I am optimistic that we got a lot of road to go. And I think at the end of the day, our mantra is we will just keep watching our results and you will see what comes out of it. As far as the first part, it\u2019s always hard. That\u2019s why I am not the biggest fan of that metric. It\u2019s always hard to differentiate some of the market factors that Maryann mentioned. Obviously, the fourth quarter, you get butane blending as one thing that enhances capture. But there is a significant, if I want to give some kudos to our team, there is a significant change in the way we are approaching the business. You heard from Rick earlier. And so I think it is additive to whatever the market has given us. And my thought is the way we have to run the company is we don\u2019t control the margin environment, but whatever margin environment is given to us, we just got to deliver more results and generate more cash and more cash per share. So, while everybody outside and inside wants to talk about that capture metric, I just keep looking at the one that matters the most to me.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome.\nMaryann Mannen: Hey Paul, it\u2019s Maryann. I just might try to add a bit more around some of the things that we are doing specifically around commercial performance without necessarily trying to give you a percentage. But we have been talking over the last several quarters about the capabilities we have built regionally, obviously, at Houston office and Singapore office or London office. That has helped us. That was laughingly saying to Mike about cracking the code on linear programming. But some of the capabilities that Rick and Brian and their respective teams have built historically give us very robust tools and data analytics that allow us to assess the decisions that we have made and know how good or bad those decisions were and what we might do with that to change it. So, it is building. These capabilities are building sustainable learnings and capabilities in the organization that we think will continue to drive our performance. I hope that\u2019s a bit more helpful, too.\nPaul Cheng: Absolutely. Thank you, Maryann.\nOperator: Next, you will hear from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nRoger Read: Yes. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.\nMike Hennigan: Thank you, Roger.\nRoger Read: Maybe just if we could address the changes here on the management team and whether or not that, what\u2019s in \u2013 what it does portend about the future? I know, Mike, you are approaching the point at which the Board has to make a decision to extend if I understood correctly from the meetings back in late November. So, anything you can offer us up on any updates there?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Roger, I will start off with, the changes are driven by two things. Results, one of the things that I feel my responsibility is to reward the results that we are getting because the team has done a very nice effort across the whole team. And the second part is development, putting people in positions such that they grow more personally so that they can contribute to the team. So, both of those factors, I think played into a lot of these assessments that occurred at the executive level, but it\u2019s also occurring below that and not everybody gets to see. So, I am a big believer in the team approach, practically all decisions that we make, all of our team is involved in. So, there is a heavy component of development on top of the results that have occurred in the last couple of years. As far as me, personally, I think you have heard in the past, that\u2019s a Board decision. The Board is very aware of that. That will play itself out in time. But Board\u2019s, if it\u2019s not their top priority, it\u2019s obviously at the very top of the first couple is what their responsibility is. So, that\u2019s just work in progress. It\u2019s been in progress for quite some time, and it will play itself out as time goes by.\nRoger Read: Okay. And then my other question was to follow-up a little bit on the balance sheet question, I think that I get asked about in debt-to-cap guidance given. But if you keep buying shares back, theoretically it could end up shrinking the equity side, which could get you to the 25%, even if you held debt flat. So, one of us can predict the future exactly where all this will shake out. But would that sort of math imply that you could actually end up staying at the same debt level? In other words, simply refinance the debt, implying that all the cash that\u2019s on there would be eligible for share repurchases or some other sort of return to shareholders, and that\u2019s the right math to follow?\nJohn Quaid: Hey Roger, it\u2019s John. You read through my subtle comments very, very well. And certainly, the other part of that equation, right, is what we are doing on the equity side. So, that was my comment, hey, we think our gross levels of debt are appropriate as we look forward, because that will be part of the math. We will take a look at that, but I think you are pretty spot on. I am not sure I can add much from what you said to be honest.\nMike Hennigan: Roger, the other thing I would add is \u2013 I am sorry, I just wanted to just add. As a general rule, my belief is we don\u2019t want to be under-levered. We don\u2019t want to be over-levered. We want to find what we think is the appropriate level. And we think we have been there and we have been consistent there. And that\u2019s why people should read into our cash position as that\u2019s going to be targeted for return to shareholders. I think our job is to generate the most cash we can, run the balance sheet properly, which we have done over the past, and then at the end of the day, return excess capital to shareholders.\nRoger Read: Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn Royall: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I just had a follow-up on the balance sheet. You had another strong quarter for the buyback of $2.5 billion. But with the crack environment turning down, you did end up drawing almost $3 billion of cash. And despite the big maintenance coming up in 1Q, it looks like January is off to a really healthy pace at $900 million. So, my question is, would you expect to maintain a similar pace throughout 1Q as you progress these turnarounds? And what could that mean for the cash draw and where balances could be at the end of 1Q?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. Hi. Good morning John, it\u2019s John here. I will take that one and let Mike add some other comments as well. But let me just start by saying, as I roll into the seat, I want to be clear, there is no change in how we are viewing return of capital, as you heard even in Mike\u2019s prepared remarks. Again, really strong performance last year, again, as we are looking to drive strong returns to our investors, and that will continue to be a key part of our capital allocation priorities in 2024. And as we look at that, we are going to look at lots of things. One, we want to be opportunistic in the overall capital allocation and we will consider the refining macro environment along with lots of other items, but \u2013 and the balance sheet and where it is. But ultimately, I just want to be clear, we are going to be steadfast in our commitment to return of capital.\nMike Hennigan: John, it\u2019s Mike. The only thing that I will add is we think it\u2019s part of our DNA and duty to return capital as part of our mantra. So, we have been saying for quite some time, and we have been fortunate, as you said, the margin environment has been conducive to generating more cash. But we have targeted all along to return that capital to shareholders. We are going to continue to do that. And then again, whatever market environment we get handled, or get handed, I am sorry, we will make that still a priority for us. It\u2019s on our capital allocation priority. We will start off with maintaining the assets, growing the dividend, investing in the business. So, that\u2019s still part of our DNA as well. But at the end, I am a huge believer is, give that capital back to shareholders and then let shareholders decide where they want to invest longer term. We want to be the vehicle where we generate cash and return capital, and as people have seen that over time, that isn\u2019t going to change regardless of what the margin environment is.\nJohn Royall: Great. Thank you. And then I apologize ahead of time to Mike for this, but I do have another question on capture. But the commercial stuff aside, can you help us think about some of the moving pieces in the first quarter? And particularly, how should we think about the impact of the heavy maintenance in the quarter? Is this still a potential to be 100% maintenance, given you have so much maintenance and any other moving pieces that we should think about that might move you away from that 100% either direction in 1Q?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey John, it\u2019s Maryann and let me see if I can take that for you and address your question. So, first and foremost, we would say we continue to think for 2024. Our objective is to drive towards that 100%. You are absolutely right in the quarter. As we have said, we have got about $600 million, but we are touching crude units. So, we are not expecting a significant amount of negative impact on our capture, despite the fact that we are seeing that level of turnaround. Now, as you know, we do have variables that impact the capture rate from quarter-to-quarter. But right now, we are not expecting turnaround to have a substantially negative impact on that drive towards 100%.\nJohn Royall: Great. Thank you very much.\nMaryann Mannen: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Hi. I wanted to ask about [Technical Difficulty] including within your own system, which should be constructive for inventories going to summer, but internationally, there is quite a bit of new supply coming online. And one of your competitors has talked about 1.5 million barrels per day number. Would you agree with that? And how much do you think could be realistically utilized?\nRick Hessling: Hi Theresa, this is Rick. I will attack the new refining capacity first. So, we see that coming on later versus sooner. And when I say later, I would say second half of this year and then some over the years, when you bring on new greenfield facilities, which are being brought on, it\u2019s been proven difficult to bring them on in a timely fashion. And these specific facilities like others, we will face challenges with logistics and supply. So, I won\u2019t specifically comment on the 1.5 million barrels, but I will say we believe it will be later versus earlier. And then for the demand piece specifically, certainly, you have seen, as you referenced, utilization even here recently down 7% in the last week due to turnarounds and weather-related events. When we look at that and look going forward, we are continuing to see steady demand. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, our export book on gas and diesel has been very solid. It was solid in 2023, and we are off to a very good start in \u201824. So, when we look at all of this together, we see it setting up very well, Theresa, for a very supportive spring and summer season.\nMike Hennigan: Theresa, it\u2019s Mike. I will just add. I mean it\u2019s pretty well documented. I mean last year, oil demand globally was over 2 million barrels a day. I know some of the forecasters are calling it 1 million barrels plus-ish. We will see how that plays itself out for this year. But I think the bigger picture, even though there has been a lot of attention, particularly to these two refineries that are coming up, as Rick mentioned later in the year. The reason we believe it\u2019s more constructive over time is we are still believers in demand is going to continue to rise. And absent this short-term issue with some of the supply coming on, we just see it very constructive where demand is going to continue to outpace, and that\u2019s why we think the margins will stay in an above mid-cycle of the term everybody is using. I think at the end of the day, we will obviously keep a watch out it, and there may be some short-term variations to that. But I think part of the reason that we remain bullish is that if we look over time, we are just big believers in demand is going to stay robust. And on paper, aside from the short-term issue, we don\u2019t see a whole lot of supply response, trying to match that. Hopefully, that makes sense to you.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks. Maybe as a follow-up on that last question, in your prepared remarks, I mean you mentioned that you, what you view as an enhanced mid-cycle environment for U.S. refiners in the coming years. I mean I think you were just talking about some of the broader global supply and demand that I think would feed into that. But can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you view as the primary drivers that uplift the margins, particularly for U.S. refiners. And when you think about the go-forward environment versus go-forward mid-cycle versus past mid-cycle, do you \u2013 what sort of uplift can, or do you think about $1 a barrel, $2 a barrel is there, and how do you underpin that in terms of kind of U.S. advantages for you and your system?\nRick Hessling: Yes. Ryan, it\u2019s Rick. So, for U.S. advantages, they are quite significant. Mike touched on early on in his prepared remarks, we have a feedstock advantage here in North America with feedstock at our doorstep, and we have access to crude from around the world. So, we believe that\u2019s a significant advantage. And it\u2019s been very well documented. We have an energy advantage with the U.S. being extremely long in nat gas, and we have cheap nat gas prices. But in addition to that, when we look at our workforce, at our assets and our refinery complexity, when you start layering all of those on top of one another, Ryan, it adds up significantly to an advantage, which is why Mike referenced earlier, we believe in an enhanced mid-cycle. Now, when you think of it from our perspective, this is where our scale really comes into play. So, we run a 1 billion barrel of system, a 1 billion barrel system annually. So, you can pick the number. We won\u2019t give you a number, but it\u2019s easy math. If it\u2019s mid-cycle plus $1, that adds $1 billion to MPC\u2019s bottom line, a $2 incentive or enhancement over mid-cycle, $2 billion. So, that\u2019s where our scale really comes into play. Now, we are bullish because of a lot of the reasons Mike mentioned. Global demand, we believe will hit a record consumption in \u201824. \u201823 was a record, we believe \u201824 will be a record. IEA believes \u201824 will be a record. In fact, IEA continues to revise up their demand forecast month-after-month and have done so for the last three months. In addition, we referenced turnarounds. Globally, turnarounds are high. When you are looking at history and we are set up well here for a strong spring and summer. I hope that helps you.\nMike Hennigan: Hi Ryan, it\u2019s Mike. Let me just add. We don\u2019t pick a number. We do scenario planning, like Rick have gave you some examples. But \u2013 so we do scenario planning, what if it\u2019s $2, what if it\u2019s $4, what if it\u2019s $6 and take a look at it from that perspective rather than trying to estimate what the number is. I am a big believer and it\u2019s hard to call the 50-yard line, but if we get the banks of the river we get the two end zones, right. Then we will be able to run the business properly for the long-term.\nOperator: And we do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJason Gabelman: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the West Coast project that you disclosed today and a two-part question on it. First, when you referenced the returns, how much \u2013 is there a decent chunk of that that\u2019s related to avoided regulatory penalties that you would incur if you didn\u2019t do the project? And then how do you get comfortable with the demand outlook on the West Coast and the potential regulations that can limit MPC\u2019s ability to capture periods where product prices are higher?\nMike Hennigan: So, Jason, on your first part, there is nothing that you said was avoiding costs, however. So, nothing is related to that. So, it\u2019s a \u2013 think of it as a reliability project, a modernization project, an efficiency project, a lower-cost project, and reducing greenhouse gas, which we need to do out there. There is regulations out there that are going to occur over time. We could have made the choice to wait until that regulatory requirement was there, but we saw an opportunity to enhance the facility ahead of time. And we have kind of disclosed already, we think there is greater than 20% return there. How do we get comfortable in the overall macro, there is going to be a tough environment for California, if things get more and more competitive out there. But we think we have a very competitive asset. So, we think we are in it for the long-term. We don\u2019t think all the facilities out there will survive the long-term, but as that volatility occurs out there, we want to have a really strong, competitive, reliable, efficient, low-cost facility.\nRick Hessling: Jason, I will just add to that. We believe our integrated system in California is a competitive advantage over the merchant refiner as well. So, when you look across our entire value chain from feedstocks and all the way through to the station level, that\u2019s a competitive advantage over the merchant refinery when you have demand declines.\nKristina Kazarian: Alright. And with that, thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, please reach out and a member of the Investor Relations team will be here to help you. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Maryann Mannen",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. We believe the improvements we've made to our cost structure, portfolio and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, irrespective of the market environment. We will continue to build on this strong foundation to recognize value throughout our business. Our refining utilization in 2023 was 92% as we operated our portfolio to meet consumer demand. Recently, we have said we believe our average capture over longer periods of time is approaching 100%. And in 2023, our full year capture was 100%. This commitment to commercial excellence is foundational and we expect to continue to see these results. While our capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics, we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years and expect to enhance further will provide a sustainable advantage. Turning to our operations. In the Gulf Coast, the Galveston Bay reformer repairs progressed as planned. We started the unit back up in mid-November and returned to full operating rates by mid-December. At our Martinez facility, we will be operating at approximately 22,000 barrels per day in the short-term. We have been working closely with the regulators to proceed with repairs to ensure safe and reliable operations. Let me move to Slide 7, which shows our capital investment plan for 2024 in a bit more detail. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. The plan includes $1.2 billion for Refining & Marketing segments. Our growth capital plan is approximately $825 million between traditional projects and low carbon. We are investing primarily at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. Within traditional Refining & Marketing, $100 million is associated with a multiyear project to increase finished distillate yields at the Galveston Bay refinery. $375 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing yields at our refineries, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost as well as investments in our branded marketing footprint. Within low carbon, approximately $330 million is allocated to a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions and $20 million for smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Slide 8 provides an overview of the multiyear investment at our Los Angeles refinery. The Los Angeles refinery is the core asset in our West Coast value chain and is one of the most competitive refineries in the regions. This investment, once completed, is expected to further enhance its cost competitiveness by integrating and modernizing utility systems, which will improve reliability and increase energy efficiency. Additionally, a portion of this improvement addresses a new regulation mandating further reductions in emissions. This regulation applies to all Southern California refineries. The improvements are expected to be completed by the end of 2025. We expect to generate a return on our investment of approximately 20%. Turning to Slide 9. At Galveston Bay, we are investing to construct a 90,000 barrel per day high-pressure distillate hydrotreater. This project is planned to strengthen the competitiveness of the refinery through increased production of higher value finished products. Once in service, the new distillate hydrotreater will upgrade high sulfur distillate to ultra-low sulfur diesel, eliminating the need for third-party processing or sales into shrinking lower value high sulfur export market. This strategic investment ensures we provide the clean burning fuel of the world demand and further enhances the competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast value chain. The project is expected to be complete by year-end 2027 and generate a return of over 20%. Turning to our low carbon initiatives, we challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and fresh water intensity. Targets, which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible pathway to accomplish. In our 2024 capital outlook, we are investing to significantly lower energy intensity and emissions at Los Angeles, one of our largest refineries. Additionally, we are investing in smaller amounts of capital in early-stage developments like RNG which could significantly aid in greenhouse gas emission reductions in the future. Overall, we are taking disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture, while continuing to supply a growing and evolving market by safely operating our current asset base with the objective to deliver superior cash flow. Let me turn the call over to John. Hey, Neil, good morning. It's Maryann. Thanks for the question. So first and foremost, as you know, commercial performance has been and will continue to be a foundational pillar for us in terms of delivering outstanding execution and meeting the goals and objectives that Mike shared with you around delivering best through cycle cash flow throughout the cycles. In the quarter, we generated about 122% capture as we shared. Overall, as you know, we've been talking about our ability to continue to drive toward 100%. Over the last couple of quarters, Rick and Brian have been sharing with you some of the key elements around structural changes that we believe are sustainable, and then Mike announced this morning a couple of other changes, which we think will continue to drive our ability to identify and deliver against that foundational principles. In the quarter, we had a couple of benefits that delivered the 122%. So first of all, strong light product margins and frankly, a more favorable secondary products impact. This is not abnormal for this period of time. Having said that, we also saw stronger jet fuel premiums to diesel and the benefit of diesel blending, excuse me, of butane blending in the quarter as well. To your question, how much of this is repeatable? Obviously, some of those things are not repeatable, particularly when we look at the sharper drop in crude oil and refined product prices. We also did have the ability of having, as I shared with you, our reformer at GVR and other benefits of projects that we completed fully operating in the quarter. So let me pause there and see if that helped to answer your question at all. Certainly, it's Maryann. Currently, we are running at about 22,000 barrels a day versus our nameplate at 48,000. We're going to continue to run at that level as we work with the regulators to determine what repairs need to be complete in order to be able to get to that nameplate at 48,000. As we think about that, as you know, we've got our JV partnership with Neste, so really, what we're looking at is the differential for MPC of about 13,000 barrels a day. So not meaningful to the 3 million-barrel system that we run. But again, running at 22,000 overall for the facility, and we will continue to work with our regulators to determine when we can bring it to full 48,000. Hey Paul, it's Maryann. I just might try to add a bit more around some of the things that we are doing specifically around commercial performance without necessarily trying to give you a percentage. But we have been talking over the last several quarters about the capabilities we have built regionally, obviously, at Houston office and Singapore office or London office. That has helped us. That was laughingly saying to Mike about cracking the code on linear programming. But some of the capabilities that Rick and Brian and their respective teams have built historically give us very robust tools and data analytics that allow us to assess the decisions that we have made and know how good or bad those decisions were and what we might do with that to change it. So, it is building. These capabilities are building sustainable learnings and capabilities in the organization that we think will continue to drive our performance. I hope that's a bit more helpful, too. Hey John, it's Maryann and let me see if I can take that for you and address your question. So, first and foremost, we would say we continue to think for 2024. Our objective is to drive towards that 100%. You are absolutely right in the quarter. As we have said, we have got about $600 million, but we are touching crude units. So, we are not expecting a significant amount of negative impact on our capture, despite the fact that we are seeing that level of turnaround. Now, as you know, we do have variables that impact the capture rate from quarter-to-quarter. But right now, we are not expecting turnaround to have a substantially negative impact on that drive towards 100%. You're welcome."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. First, I'd like to recognize some changes we made at our executive management level. Maryann Mannen has been appointed President of MPC. In this role, she will be responsible for our Refining & Marketing, Commercial and HES&S organizations. John Quaid, previously CFO of MPLX succeeds Maryann as CFO of MPC. In addition to these changes, Rick Hessling has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer. Rick will lead our global feedstock and clean products teams with the goal of maximizing margin capture across the entire value chain. Brian Partee has been appointed Chief Global Optimization Officer. Brian will be responsible for assessing and redefining business processes that are critical to improving our performance, including our value chain optimization efforts and determining investments needed to accelerate the delivery of results. At a high level, these organizational changes put more emphasis on advancing important value-creating initiatives, driving increased performance throughout our entire value chain and making a step change in our cash flow generation capability. Turning to our 2023 results. We are pleased to continue to deliver on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was over $14 billion on a consolidated basis, reflecting our team's strong execution. Our Refining & Marketing business delivered excellent full year results generating EBITDA of $12.74 per barrel of throughput and capture of 100%. These results reflect strong utilization of our assets and improved execution against our commercial strategy. Incremental to our Refining & Marketing results, our Midstream business posted nearly $6.2 billion of EBITDA. EBITDA for the Midstream segment grew by approximately 7% year-over-year or by approximately $400 million. We expect MPC will receive $2.2 billion of annual cash distributions supported by MPLX's most recent 10% increase to its quarterly distribution. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio. Its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to increase its cash distribution as it pursues growth opportunities further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. We are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. In 2023, we returned $11.6 billion through share repurchases, bringing total repurchases to over $29 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC's quarterly dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. Over the past 5 years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of over 12%. For the full year 2023, this capital return represents a payout of 92% of our operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. Executing on our commitments, combined with a strong macro environment led to total shareholder returns of approximately 31% for MPC in 2023. Turning to our view on the refining macro environment as we head into 2024, global oil demand hit a record high in \u201823 and we see another year of record oil consumption in \u201824. The IEA is currently projecting demand growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day with their projections having been raised higher over the last 3 consecutive months. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Global supply remains constrained and anticipated global capacity additions have progressed slower than expectations. Gasoline and diesel inventories remained tight globally. And as we look into \u201824, we anticipate that above-average turnaround activity globally in the first quarter as well as the transition to summer gasoline blends will be supportive of refining margins. As we look further into 2024, we believe the U.S. refining industry will experience an enhanced mid-cycle environment due to global supply demand fundamentals and its relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include: first, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Second, our dividend. We are committed to paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We intend to evaluate the dividend at least annually. Third, growth capital. We will invest capital, but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. Beyond these three objectives, we will return excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. From May of \u201821 through January 2024, we reduced our total share count by approximately 45%, repurchasing approximately 300 million shares at an average price of $97. As we execute in 2024, we remain committed to share repurchases as a key component of our capital allocation priorities. MPC's standalone 2024 capital investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. Underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance, sustaining capital is approximately 35% of capital spend. In Refining & Marketing, gross spending is down nearly $200 million compared to 2023, reflecting strong capital discipline. In 2024, we are focused on investments that enhance margin and reduce costs. In low carbon, we are investing in an opportunity that offers an attractive return, lowers our cost, increases reliability and reduces emissions. This morning, MPLX also announced its 2024 capital investment plan of $1.1 billion, which is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann. Thanks, John. We've delivered strong execution on our strategic commitments again this year. This includes running reliably with high utilization, structural improvements to our commercial performance, fostering a low cost culture and strengthening the competitive position of our assets. At MPLX, the partnership has continued to grow, increasing its cash flow and its cash distribution MPC. We have invested capital to grow earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. This has resulted in superior cash flow generation and supported the repurchase initiatives. Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets, and we will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. We believe our focus on safety, environmental, I'm sorry, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment, which we expect to continue longer-term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. MPC's Midstream segment, consisting primarily of MPLX has grown EBITDA by $1.3 billion since 2019, which is a 6% compound annual growth rate over the last 4 years. As MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it's in a strong position to continue to consistently grow its distributions. As a result of MPLX increase against distribution 10% of reach in the last 2 years, and MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion of cash distribution, which reflects a $400 million increase since 2020. Each 10% distribution increase is approximately $200 million of additional cash flow that MPC receives through its ownership in the partnership. In summary, this year, we generated $14 billion of cash from operations. We increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $11.6 billion of shares, resulting in a 92% payout ratio. In 2023, MPC's total shareholder return was 31%. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior return to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to Kristina. Yes, Neil, it's Mike. Yes, I think we said in our prepared remarks that our turnaround spend this year is about the same as last year. But the way you should think about it is, as Maryann mentioned, in the first quarter, we're pretty heavy at four of our largest facilities, our largest financial generating facility. So we're taking advantage of the fact that margins are down in the first quarter. So we're spending $600 million in the first quarter, which is a high number, relative to the full year. And I know we don't traditionally give quarter-to-quarter, but I'll just tell you that next quarter, the turnaround number drops down to like $200 million or so, somewhere in that range. So we're being opportunistic in some regard. A lot of the activity does get planned, but at the same time, we want to take advantage of the fact that the margin environment now is constructive for us to be off-line so that when margins, we think, are going to be a lot stronger in the second quarter, we will have our four largest facilities turn around and ready to deliver results. You are welcome, Neil. Yes, Manav, this is Mike. I'll start. First of all, thank you for the comment on capture. And as you said, it's not my favorite metric, but I'm a big believer in how much cash are we generating, how much cash per share we're generating. And I want to lead in those categories is the metric that I spend the most time looking at. But, it does get some good indication, as Mary said, it's hard just to differentiate the question Neil asked between what's happening in the market? And what are some of the structural improvements that we've implemented over the last couple of years here. But anyway, thanks for the comment. As far as our capital investment, I'm hoping everybody sees a couple of things. One is, yes, we are investing in our L.A. facility. It's an area where we believe that we can put a decent amount of investment in there and really improve the competitiveness of that facility, but we already believe it's one of the top facilities on the West Coast. So it is an area that we want to invest in. Now that particular investment is about efficiency, reliability and lowering our costs. And to your point, being a very reliable supplier out there is an important part of the equation. The other project that we've announced is a margin enhancement project. And in our view, things are not going to get easier for unhydrotreated distillate into the future. And if you look at the spreads today, even today, they are pretty wide. So at the end of the day, what's driving us the most in both of those, when we put this in the slides is we think both of these projects are north of 20% returns. And hopefully, we're conservative on that, but we think they are very good investments and again, in two of our largest, highest financial generating facilities. So one of the themes that you've heard from us is we're going to invest in projects that we feel really strong about on a return basis, but they are also enhancing in competitive positions of some of our biggest facilities. And I think you've heard the theme from us for a while here. It's margin enhancement, lower cost and efficiencies. And out on the West Coast, the other driver is there is emissions reductions goals that are going to occur over time, and this project will take care of that in a large way, and that's why we grouped it into our low-carbon area. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color. You are welcome, Manav. And Doug, it's Mike. I know it's been a source of frustration since we don't give a lot of detail in this area for competitive reasons. But to Rick's point, we've made some changes. And to be honest with you, I'm more excited about what's in the future for us. Brian's new role as Head of Global Optimization for us, I think, is going to make a step change for where we're going. So we've had a lot of momentum in this area. It's showing up in the results. As we discussed, capture is not my favorite, but generating cash is. And at the end of the day, I think we have more opportunity in the whole area. If we run well and then deliver commercially, we will continue to generate cash and be a good source of return for shareholders. Good morning, Paul. Yes. Paul, first off, Dave Heppner's group is constantly looking at the market and what assets are available I always say I never say never. But in the meantime, while Dave is working on that side of the equation, we're also looking at the footprint we have and the assets we have. And that's part of the reason that we came out with the announcement today. Two of our key facilities, we think we can make a meaningful change. And we've been more transparent than normal to try and explain to people. We think we got north of 20% return projects here on the assets that we own ourselves. So, there is always a balance call between, obviously, the assets you own, you know inside and out, whereas the ones you're evaluating externally, there is a little bit of concern from diligence, etcetera. But I will tell you, I think people know my DNA in general. But at the same time, Dave and his team are challenging where can we make investments that are outside of our portfolio. We haven't done a lot, as you mentioned on the refining side. But we have made some investments overcalling low carbon. We made some investments in some pretreat facilities on the low carbon side. We've invested in an RNG facility. So Dave and his team are looking at both refining and outside of refining. And we just constantly talk about that and decide where do we think we want to put our capital. And for today, we're pleased to report that we think we have two pretty good projects. But the other part, let me just mention this one last thing because this is kind of important. On the slide where we talk about our capital, we say in traditional refining, we're investing $475 million. Maryann mentioned that $100 million of that is related to the DHT project, but $375 million of that is what we don't typically talk about on earnings calls. These are projects in all of our facilities that are higher returns, really good projects for us, but they don't have the sexy headline about them. But if you look at it, though, $375 million out of the $475 million in traditional are these smaller high-return projects. So, the team does a nice job. Tim and his organization are constantly looking for areas where we can make margin improvement, lower cost, increase reliability. As you said, this all starts with you got to run reliably, and then you got to be smart commercially. And I think we've demonstrated that a little bit, and then we just try to invest capital to keep bolstering that equation. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color. Paul, I will start with the second part. As I have said, I will repeat myself a little bit, but we still think there is quite a ways to go where we can do better, and that was part of the reasoning behind the organizational change. Brian's role as global optimization lead is going to his team is going to work with the commercial guys with our refining guys. And you heard me say we define process, find places to invest, change what we are doing today. So, I think we have made a lot of progress. People always ask what inning or I guess it's football season, so what quarter are we in. And that's always hard to ascertain because I think we keep peeling the onion back and seeing that we can make another step change. So, I am optimistic that we got a lot of road to go. And I think at the end of the day, our mantra is we will just keep watching our results and you will see what comes out of it. As far as the first part, it's always hard. That's why I am not the biggest fan of that metric. It's always hard to differentiate some of the market factors that Maryann mentioned. Obviously, the fourth quarter, you get butane blending as one thing that enhances capture. But there is a significant, if I want to give some kudos to our team, there is a significant change in the way we are approaching the business. You heard from Rick earlier. And so I think it is additive to whatever the market has given us. And my thought is the way we have to run the company is we don't control the margin environment, but whatever margin environment is given to us, we just got to deliver more results and generate more cash and more cash per share. So, while everybody outside and inside wants to talk about that capture metric, I just keep looking at the one that matters the most to me. You're welcome. Thank you, Roger. Yes. Roger, I will start off with, the changes are driven by two things. Results, one of the things that I feel my responsibility is to reward the results that we are getting because the team has done a very nice effort across the whole team. And the second part is development, putting people in positions such that they grow more personally so that they can contribute to the team. So, both of those factors, I think played into a lot of these assessments that occurred at the executive level, but it's also occurring below that and not everybody gets to see. So, I am a big believer in the team approach, practically all decisions that we make, all of our team is involved in. So, there is a heavy component of development on top of the results that have occurred in the last couple of years. As far as me, personally, I think you have heard in the past, that's a Board decision. The Board is very aware of that. That will play itself out in time. But Board's, if it's not their top priority, it's obviously at the very top of the first couple is what their responsibility is. So, that's just work in progress. It's been in progress for quite some time, and it will play itself out as time goes by. Roger, the other thing I would add is \u2013 I am sorry, I just wanted to just add. As a general rule, my belief is we don't want to be under-levered. We don't want to be over-levered. We want to find what we think is the appropriate level. And we think we have been there and we have been consistent there. And that's why people should read into our cash position as that's going to be targeted for return to shareholders. I think our job is to generate the most cash we can, run the balance sheet properly, which we have done over the past, and then at the end of the day, return excess capital to shareholders. You're welcome. John, it's Mike. The only thing that I will add is we think it's part of our DNA and duty to return capital as part of our mantra. So, we have been saying for quite some time, and we have been fortunate, as you said, the margin environment has been conducive to generating more cash. But we have targeted all along to return that capital to shareholders. We are going to continue to do that. And then again, whatever market environment we get handled, or get handed, I am sorry, we will make that still a priority for us. It's on our capital allocation priority. We will start off with maintaining the assets, growing the dividend, investing in the business. So, that's still part of our DNA as well. But at the end, I am a huge believer is, give that capital back to shareholders and then let shareholders decide where they want to invest longer term. We want to be the vehicle where we generate cash and return capital, and as people have seen that over time, that isn't going to change regardless of what the margin environment is. Theresa, it's Mike. I will just add. I mean it's pretty well documented. I mean last year, oil demand globally was over 2 million barrels a day. I know some of the forecasters are calling it 1 million barrels plus-ish. We will see how that plays itself out for this year. But I think the bigger picture, even though there has been a lot of attention, particularly to these two refineries that are coming up, as Rick mentioned later in the year. The reason we believe it's more constructive over time is we are still believers in demand is going to continue to rise. And absent this short-term issue with some of the supply coming on, we just see it very constructive where demand is going to continue to outpace, and that's why we think the margins will stay in an above mid-cycle of the term everybody is using. I think at the end of the day, we will obviously keep a watch out it, and there may be some short-term variations to that. But I think part of the reason that we remain bullish is that if we look over time, we are just big believers in demand is going to stay robust. And on paper, aside from the short-term issue, we don't see a whole lot of supply response, trying to match that. Hopefully, that makes sense to you. You're welcome. Hi Ryan, it's Mike. Let me just add. We don't pick a number. We do scenario planning, like Rick have gave you some examples. But \u2013 so we do scenario planning, what if it's $2, what if it's $4, what if it's $6 and take a look at it from that perspective rather than trying to estimate what the number is. I am a big believer and it's hard to call the 50-yard line, but if we get the banks of the river we get the two end zones, right. Then we will be able to run the business properly for the long-term. So, Jason, on your first part, there is nothing that you said was avoiding costs, however. So, nothing is related to that. So, it's a \u2013 think of it as a reliability project, a modernization project, an efficiency project, a lower-cost project, and reducing greenhouse gas, which we need to do out there. There is regulations out there that are going to occur over time. We could have made the choice to wait until that regulatory requirement was there, but we saw an opportunity to enhance the facility ahead of time. And we have kind of disclosed already, we think there is greater than 20% return there. How do we get comfortable in the overall macro, there is going to be a tough environment for California, if things get more and more competitive out there. But we think we have a very competitive asset. So, we think we are in it for the long-term. We don't think all the facilities out there will survive the long-term, but as that volatility occurs out there, we want to have a really strong, competitive, reliable, efficient, low-cost facility."

            "name": "John Quaid",
            "content": "Thanks, Maryann. Moving to fourth quarter highlights, Slide 11 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 for the fourth quarter and $23.63 for the full year. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude the $0.14 per share net effect of three items, a $145 million LIFO inventory charge, $47 million of net recoveries related to MPLX's Garyville incident response, and a $92 million gain recognized by MPLX. Adjusted EBITDA was over $3.5 billion for the quarter and almost $19 billion for the year. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, was nearly $2.3 billion for the quarter and $13.9 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $311 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.5 billion of our shares. Slide 12 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter to fourth quarter of 2023 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.2 billion, driven by lower R&M margins. The tax rate for the quarter was 18%, reflecting the impacts of the MPLX structure and a discrete benefit largely related to state taxes. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be around 21%. Moving to our segment results. Slide 13 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the fourth quarter. Our 13 refineries ran at a 91% utilization, processing nearly 2.7 million barrels of crude per day. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower across all regions driven by lower crack spreads. Capture for the quarter was 122%. Refining operating costs were $5.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter, higher sequentially due to higher energy cost, particularly on the West Coast as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Slide 14 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture of 122% for the quarter. We ran well and our commercial teams executed effectively to deliver strong results. Capture this quarter benefited from late product margin tailwinds, in particular for jet fuel as well as less of a headwind from secondary product prices. Slide 15 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment delivered strong fourth quarter results. For the full year 2023, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 7% compared to the prior year. Our Midstream business is growing and generating strong cash flows as we advance high return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Slide 16 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $2.3 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining and Midstream businesses. Working capital was a $1.1 billion use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by declining crude prices. Cash from ops for the quarter was also impacted by a $320 million headwind from changes in our income tax receivable, which you might usually expect to see as a working capital change. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $896 million this quarter. This includes MPLX's acquisition of full ownership of a gathering and processing joint venture in the Delaware Basin for approximately $270 million. MPC returned $2.8 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximate 125% payout of the $2.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to deliver superior shareholder returns. As of January 26, we have approximately $5.9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And at the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $10.2 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash. Turning to guidance on Slide 17, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of almost 2.5 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 83%. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due mainly to higher turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $600 million. We are executing turnarounds at 4 of our largest refineries, Galveston Bay, Garyville, Los Angeles and Robinson, all in the first quarter when margins are typically lower to minimize the financial impact of these outages. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be similar to last year at around $1.3 billion. Operating costs in the first quarter are expected to be $5.85 per barrel higher sequentially due mainly to lower throughput volumes associated with the significant planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.45 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $185 million. And with that, let me pass it back to Mike. Hey, good morning, Doug, it's John. I'll go ahead and take that. No, no, not a problem at all. And I think you kind of \u2013 were hinting at it as you were getting there. We've got a lot of financial flexibility right now. We're very comfortable with the gross amount of debt that MPC has but certainly have the balance sheet to be very thoughtful about the right timing of refinancing that debt and really optimizing our cost of capital and really that cost of debt. And I think longer-term, right, we've laid out a target of kind of the gross debt to cap of 25% to 30%. We're a good bit away from that, but that's something we will continue to monitor as we look out into the future. It's stand-alone. In a much different position, I can probably speak to that one pretty well just given the seat I was in before, or. You've got a really stable company running at sub-3.5% leverage, but the cash flows there can probably support a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4x. Again, they have got some financial flexibility to be smart about what they are doing as well. So I think both balance sheets are in a really strong place. Hey Roger, it's John. You read through my subtle comments very, very well. And certainly, the other part of that equation, right, is what we are doing on the equity side. So, that was my comment, hey, we think our gross levels of debt are appropriate as we look forward, because that will be part of the math. We will take a look at that, but I think you are pretty spot on. I am not sure I can add much from what you said to be honest. Yes. Hi. Good morning John, it's John here. I will take that one and let Mike add some other comments as well. But let me just start by saying, as I roll into the seat, I want to be clear, there is no change in how we are viewing return of capital, as you heard even in Mike's prepared remarks. Again, really strong performance last year, again, as we are looking to drive strong returns to our investors, and that will continue to be a key part of our capital allocation priorities in 2024. And as we look at that, we are going to look at lots of things. One, we want to be opportunistic in the overall capital allocation and we will consider the refining macro environment along with lots of other items, but \u2013 and the balance sheet and where it is. But ultimately, I just want to be clear, we are going to be steadfast in our commitment to return of capital."

            "name": "Rick Hessling",
            "content": "Yes. Hi, Doug, this is Rick. So I'll take a stab at that. So we are significantly I would say every day, Doug, we are optimizing our slate. And we look at this regionally. We look at this by plant. But in the end, Doug, I think what we do better than others in the industry, is we optimize for the betterment of our total return at the end of the day. So we are not, we could suboptimize one plant for the benefit of another, and we have worked years, decades, as a matter of fact, to give ourselves optionality within our Mid-Con system. We are currently juggling optionality with TMX and our West Coast and Pacific Northwest system as well as we've worked on it for quite a while on the Gulf Coast. So you are onto something from a crude slate perspective. It's constantly changing. We're constantly pushing the norm on what we should run, what crudes we look at, what assays we look at, updating our system. So this is just an ongoing exercise that's been happening now for several years now. And I've said it before, we're unpacking everything from A to Z, Doug, we're leaving no rock unturned in terms of capturing value. And that not only goes certainly on the crude slate side, but it goes throughout our entire value chain. Hi Theresa, this is Rick. I will attack the new refining capacity first. So, we see that coming on later versus sooner. And when I say later, I would say second half of this year and then some over the years, when you bring on new greenfield facilities, which are being brought on, it's been proven difficult to bring them on in a timely fashion. And these specific facilities like others, we will face challenges with logistics and supply. So, I won't specifically comment on the 1.5 million barrels, but I will say we believe it will be later versus earlier. And then for the demand piece specifically, certainly, you have seen, as you referenced, utilization even here recently down 7% in the last week due to turnarounds and weather-related events. When we look at that and look going forward, we are continuing to see steady demand. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, our export book on gas and diesel has been very solid. It was solid in 2023, and we are off to a very good start in \u201824. So, when we look at all of this together, we see it setting up very well, Theresa, for a very supportive spring and summer season. Yes. Ryan, it's Rick. So, for U.S. advantages, they are quite significant. Mike touched on early on in his prepared remarks, we have a feedstock advantage here in North America with feedstock at our doorstep, and we have access to crude from around the world. So, we believe that's a significant advantage. And it's been very well documented. We have an energy advantage with the U.S. being extremely long in nat gas, and we have cheap nat gas prices. But in addition to that, when we look at our workforce, at our assets and our refinery complexity, when you start layering all of those on top of one another, Ryan, it adds up significantly to an advantage, which is why Mike referenced earlier, we believe in an enhanced mid-cycle. Now, when you think of it from our perspective, this is where our scale really comes into play. So, we run a 1 billion barrel of system, a 1 billion barrel system annually. So, you can pick the number. We won't give you a number, but it's easy math. If it's mid-cycle plus $1, that adds $1 billion to MPC's bottom line, a $2 incentive or enhancement over mid-cycle, $2 billion. So, that's where our scale really comes into play. Now, we are bullish because of a lot of the reasons Mike mentioned. Global demand, we believe will hit a record consumption in \u201824. \u201823 was a record, we believe \u201824 will be a record. IEA believes \u201824 will be a record. In fact, IEA continues to revise up their demand forecast month-after-month and have done so for the last three months. In addition, we referenced turnarounds. Globally, turnarounds are high. When you are looking at history and we are set up well here for a strong spring and summer. I hope that helps you. Jason, I will just add to that. We believe our integrated system in California is a competitive advantage over the merchant refiner as well. So, when you look across our entire value chain from feedstocks and all the way through to the station level, that's a competitive advantage over the merchant refinery when you have demand declines."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. References to MPC\u2019s refining utilization for the third quarter, as well as fourth quarter guidance now include the addition of approximately 40,000 barrels a day of capacity related to STAR in our Gulf Coast region. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan : Thank you, Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Beginning with our view on the refining environment, in the third quarter, we saw strong demand and global supply tightness supporting refining margins. Diesel cracks led the barrels inventories remain tight and European distillate production ran below capacity. Globally, oil demand is at a record high as the need for affordable and reliable energy increases throughout the world. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year across the gasoline and diesel and demand for jet fuel continues to grow. Global supply remains constrained and global capacity additions have progressed at a slow pace. In the regions where we operate, seasonal butane blending has increased gasoline supply. However, we expect typical seasonal turnarounds to be supportive of cracks. To that end, we\u2019ve seen 3.5 million barrels of gasoline inventory drawn out of the U.S. system over the past several weeks. OPEC+ has reduced production, adding pressure to medium sour differentials. While crude differentials have generally been narrowing, we have seen WCS widen and we\u2019re strategically situated to run heavy Canadian crude at our refineries across PADDs 2, 3 and 5. As we look towards 2024, we believe an enhanced mid-cycle environment will continue in the U.S. due to the global supply demand fundamentals and the relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Turning to our results, in the third quarter, we delivered strong cash generation across our business. In Refining & Marketing, strong margins, 94% utilization and solid commercial performance led the segment adjusted EBITDA of $4.4 billion or $16.06 per barrel. Our Midstream segment delivered durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated segment adjusted EBITDA of over $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 6% compared to the prior year period. The strength of MPLX\u2019s cash flows supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by another 10%. With this increase, MPC is expected to receive $2.2 billion of distributions from MPLX annually. MPLX is strategic to MPC\u2019s portfolio. Its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC\u2019s dividend and more than half of our planned 2023 capital program. We expect MPLX\u2019s cash distribution to continue growing as it pursues growth opportunities, which will further enhance the value of this strategic relationship. We believe MPC\u2019s current capital allocation priorities are optimal for our shareholders. In the third quarter, we returned $3.1 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Last week, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization and a 10% increase to MPC\u2019s quarterly dividend. With this increase, we have grown our quarterly dividend at over 12% compound annual rate over the past five years, which has led our refining peers. Our overall capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base, while paying a secure competitive and growing dividend. We intend to grow the Company\u2019s earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline. And beyond these three priorities, we are firmly committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. Let me also share some of the progress on our low carbon initiatives. The Martinez Renewables fuel facility is being delivered safely, on time, and on budget, and by the end of 2023, the facility is expected to produce 730 million gallons per year. At that point, Martinez will be among the largest renewable diesel facilities with a competitive operating profile, robust logistics flexibility, and advantaged feedstock slate and should benefit from the global strategic relationship with Neste. Our Dickinson renewable diesel facility is operating well. The facility processed 75% advantaged feed in the third quarter. The nearby Spiritwood soybean processing plant, which is owned through a joint venture with ADM, is expected to deliver enough vegetable oil to produce approximately 75 million gallons per year of renewable diesel. Additionally, we are advancing early stage developments through our interest in low carbon intensity RNG and other small scale investments. We believe through these projects, we\u2019re taking disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture and supply to a growing and evolving market, while operating our current asset base to deliver superior cash flow and meet demands. At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks Mike. Moving to third quarter highlights, slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $8.14. This quarter\u2019s results were adjusted to exclude a $106 million gain on sale of MPC\u2019s 25% interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal, as well as $63 million of response costs associated with our unplanned outage at Garyville. These adjustments reduced our reported adjusted earnings by $0.14 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion for the quarter. And cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes, was over $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we returned $297 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.8 billion of our shares. And from May 2021 through October 27th, we have repurchased 285 million shares or approximately 44% of the shares outstanding. Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second quarter 2023 to third quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially by approximately $1.2 billion, driven by higher R&M margins. Corporate expenses were higher sequentially by $40 million, primarily due to a charge related to valuation of existing performance-based stock compensation expense. The tax rate for the third quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $1 billion. Moving to our segment results, slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Our refining assets ran at 94% utilization, processing nearly 2.8 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. Sequentially, per barrel margins were higher across all regions driven by higher crack spreads. Capture was 93%. Refining operating costs were $5.14 per barrel in the third quarter, flat sequentially. We did have unplanned downtime during the quarter, impacting our two largest refineries, which resulted in lost crude throughput of 4.7 million barrels due to the Galveston Bay reformer outage and 2.1 million barrels at Garyville. Additionally, this downtime resulted in a headwind to our overall capture. We began construction activities on the reformer repair about three months after the event, once regulators gave us clearance and we were able to finalize the required repairs. Since then, repairs have progressed as planned and during this outage, we pulled forward turnaround work into the third and fourth quarters, which had been scheduled in the first quarter of 2024. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 93%. Our commercial team executed effectively, despite weak secondary product pricing and refinery downtime, which weighed on capture this quarter. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years will provide a sustainable advantage. This commitment to commercial performance is foundational and we expect to continue to see the results. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the second quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment delivered strong third quarter results. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat sequentially and 3% higher year-over-year, primarily due to higher throughputs and rates. Year-to-date, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 6% compared to the prior year period. As Mike mentioned earlier, the growth of MPLX\u2019s earnings supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by another 10% to $0.85 per unit, and MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion in cash from MPLX on an annual basis. Our Midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the quarter, operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital with over $4.3 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $609 million tailwind for the quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude oil prices. Year-to-date, working capital has been $1.4 billion worth of cash. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $486 million this quarter, consistent with our 2023 outlook. MPC returned nearly $3.1 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximately 72% payout of the $4.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. As of October 27th, we have approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization, which includes the additional $5 billion approval announced last week. At the end of third quarter, MPC had approximately $13.1 billion in consolidated cash and short term investments. This includes approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash. Turning to guidance, on slide 11, we provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 90%. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than third quarter levels due to turnaround activity having a higher impact on units in the fourth quarter. In the Gulf Coast, with respect to the Galveston Bay reformer, repairs have progressed as planned. We anticipate starting the unit back up in mid November. Production is expected to ramp over the next several weeks. And guidance anticipates returning to full operating rates by mid-December, following advanced turnaround activity. And as I mentioned earlier, during this outage, we plan to continue progressing and complete turnaround work that was previously scheduled for 2024. As a result, planned turnaround expense is now projected to be approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter. Operating costs per barrel in the fourth quarter are expected to be $5.60, higher sequentially due to higher energy cost, particularly on the West Coast, as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: In summary, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets. We\u2019ll also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. Through the third quarter, we\u2019ve invested over $1.7 billion in capital and investment, which includes $390 million of maintenance capital as well as over $900 million on refinery turnarounds in 2023. Our focus on safety, operational excellence, and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture the enhanced mid-cycle environment, which we expect to continue longer term given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. MPLX remains a source of growth in our portfolio. Partnership is expected to distribute over $2.2 billion to MPC annually. And as MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it will continue to have capacity to increase its cash distributions to MPC. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice, with the strongest through cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders, supported by our firm commitment to return capital. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions and as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If time permits, we\u2019ll re-prompt for additional questions. And with that, Sheila, we\u2019re ready for them.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.\nManav Gupta: When we look at the refiners, they look at themselves and perform -- on different performance metrics, some look at refining capture. You guys really focus on EBITDA margin per barrel. And when we look at that metrics, it looks like for a second year in a row, you\u2019ll be on top of that table, outperforming your peers. So, help us understand a little better what\u2019s allowing you to drive this outperformance and deliver such strong results when it comes to EBITDA margin per barrel in your refining system?\nRick Hessling: Hi, Manav. It\u2019s Rick. First of all, thank you for the perceptive callout. I will tell you we are uber-focused on EBITDA and our results compared to others. And our team will certainly greatly appreciate your callout on this as they\u2019ve been working on this consistently for years now, Manav, and you\u2019re seeing it pull through to our results. So, who kudos to the team there. I will kind of backtrack and state what we\u2019ve stated in past quarters, Manav. We\u2019ve made structural improvements throughout our entire commercial value chain to capture value from the front end all the way through the back end. And specifically, we\u2019re doing so in a way today that is -- it is creating a mindset change within our teams, and we are, I would say, taking more calculated risk with our approach and how we look at everything. There isn\u2019t a rock that we\u2019re not overturning to see what\u2019s under it. And we\u2019re assuming, Manav, we do everything wrong. And with that mindset, you can create a lot of value, in looking at things you haven\u2019t looked at in the past. In the Midwest specifically, I will really pivot on a couple of things. We have a fully integrated system. We have four great refineries in the Midwest. In the third quarter, as you know, they ran very well. We have access to advantaged feedstocks, both Canadian and domestic, and then Brian\u2019s team has created exceptional optionality for product placement. So, when you combine all those factors together, Manav, you really get to an end result that it\u2019s been consistent, as you stated, over the last several quarters and we expect it to continue.\nMike Hennigan: Manav, it\u2019s Mike. The only thing I would add to what Rick said is, we start with EBITDA per barrel. We want to make sure we\u2019re generating as much earnings as we can as we run our assets. Ultimately, though, I care the most about cash generation. I mean, it starts with EBITDA per barrel, but the bottom line is, are we generating significant amount of cash to give us the flexibility to drive shareholder returns. So, I think you hit the starting point with EBITDA per barrel. The ending point is generating cash and then having that flexibility.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. A quick follow-up here. You guys are known for your strong operational performance. 3Q was a little unusual. You had some unplanned incidents. And despite those, you delivered a pretty strong beat. But I\u2019m trying to understand, let\u2019s say those incidents would not have happened, would we have got even a stronger quarter, if you could talk about that?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. Thank you, it\u2019s Maryann and thanks for the question. You\u2019re right. As we shared with you, we did have a couple of unplanned downtime events in the quarter that impacted the Gulf Coast. One, the most significant in terms of its contribution is the Galveston Bay reformer, and then, obviously, we had our, Garyville. Had we not had those two impacts, I\u2019m happy to share a little bit more about those in a moment here, our capture would have been 6% higher than what we reported with the lion\u2019s share of that capture event obviously being the reformer. As I mentioned, 4.7 million barrels in the quarter that we lost, and then on Garyville, it\u2019s about 2.1 million barrels as we operated about half rate for just under a week. It took us about -- just back to, Galveston Bay for a moment. It took us about three months before, we were able to begin our work as we -- as the regulators got through their work and then we determined where all the repairs needed to be. So we were about three months, to the start of getting those, activities launched. I hope that answers the question.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Well, first of all, thank you for taking my questions. Maryann, that last response was actually one of the key things we wanted to hit. So, let me try two more if I may. First of all, Mike, in your opening remarks, you talked about demand in your system is pretty strong. I wonder if I could ask you to isolate that to export demand, because obviously that\u2019s a fairly big swing factor for the U.S. market in particular. How does that look in your system?\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Doug, I\u2019ll let Brian comment on that.\nBrian Partee: So really, our theme on demand, both domestically and internationally is stable and steady. It\u2019s been that way really throughout the year. In the quarter, we exported roughly 250,000 barrels a day out of our system in the Gulf Coast, despite some operational challenges, as noted. About two-thirds of that is distillate, the balance of course is gasoline. The demand center in Latin America and the Caribbean really has been strong and resilient and growing throughout the year. They import roughly 2.3 million barrels a day into the system. The U.S. has been about 65% of that. We have come off a little bit in terms of our share into Latin America and the Caribbean in exchange for share into Europe. So, we are seeing growth in European imports as you\u2019ve probably seen as well, roughly 200,000 barrels a day in the quarter from the U.S. into Europe. The one cautionary tale there, it is the one weakest spot that we see throughout our network, which is distillate demand in Europe. Our team sees it as roughly 4% to 6% off year-to-year with expectations and a bit of hope that as we get into the colder weather season here later this year, we\u2019ll see a pickup in demand in Europe, but that is the one soft spot that we\u2019re seeing.\nDoug Leggate: Mike, I apologize for this one, but I guess somebody\u2019s got to ask it. So, there\u2019s speculation overnight about the Citgo process and Marathon being mentioned as a potential bidder. So, I wonder if you could frame whether that is, in fact, a consideration that you thought about, what the rationale would be and how you would see something like that fitting in with your portfolio high-grading focus that you\u2019ve had over the last several years?\nMike Hennigan: I\u2019m going to let Dave start, and then I\u2019ll come back afterwards.\nDave Heppner: So, I appreciate the question. We anticipated that. And Mike said in the past, we like to and do look at everything out there as a general comment. But I think we\u2019re more focused currently on -- and Rick touched on this a little bit on opportunities to build out our competencies and increase our competitive advantages along our existing refinery value chains. And when we say that, that\u2019s inclusive of MPC and MPLX, so from wellhead to wheel is the way to think about it. So, with that said and on the current environment, we believe that M&A within refining, refining M&A is one of the more challenging ways to create value. And with all that said, I would not anticipate us, or you shouldn\u2019t anticipate us participating in the current auction process for the Citgo assets. I don\u2019t know where the rumor came from, but we\u2019re not interested in the auction process.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Maybe this is for Maryann or maybe for Rich. For the West Coast marketing margins condition, that seems to be very strong and you do have a dealer network there. So just curious that in the third quarter, how much is the West Coast contribution coming from that piece of the business? Is it growing or that -- what\u2019s your plan over there? That\u2019s the first question.\nBrian Partee: Yes. Paul, good morning. This is Brian. I\u2019ll take that one. Really very limited impact in the quarter from our marketing business on the West Coast. We actually saw prices increase pretty substantially on the West Coast in the quarter due to some unplanned outages in the system. And when that occurs, we actually see just the opposite. We see a lot of pressure on the margin out in the West Coast and other markets. So, not a big contributor there in the quarter. Now, as we look ahead to 4Q, as market comes off, we would expect to see some recovery and some margin expansion in the fourth quarter. But to your other question, we are absolutely actively engaged in growing and continuing to grow that network. We\u2019ve put up really good numbers last year and this year and look at it as a strategic component of our position out in the West Coast.\nPaul Cheng: Hey, Brian, do you have any rough estimate you can share that, how many stations that you\u2019re trying to grow it on annual basis over the next several years there?\nBrian Partee: Really don\u2019t want to forecast a station growth expectation, Paul. We\u2019re really focused on value growth. So it\u2019s really it\u2019s a PV optimization looking at volume and margin, so it\u2019s not driven by station growth or volume alone.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Mike, I know that maybe it\u2019s still a little bit early, can you talk about that plus and minus is on the variable for the CapEx outlook for the next several years compared to this year? Are we expecting a pretty steady program or that you\u2019re looking for opportunity to grow both in the -- maybe refining, including the yield or that reducing energy and MPLX? So, can you just give us some idea that how the trend is going to look like in the CapEx and efficacy level?\nMaryann Mannen: Sure, Paul. It\u2019s Maryann. Let me talk a little bit about CapEx in general and then I\u2019ll pass it to Mike and he\u2019ll share some incremental thoughts as well. But as you know, one of our principles, if you will, our strategic pillars is strict capital discipline. And I think that has -- hopefully you\u2019ve seen that we have implemented that principle well over the last few years. When you look at 2017 to 2020, our consolidated CapEx averaged about $3.5 billion. And as you look \u201821 to \u201823, that\u2019s averaged $2.1 billion. So again that premise of strict capital discipline ensuring that we\u2019re delivering the returns has been an important piece of the work that we\u2019ve been doing. I think in refining, we continue to look for cost reduction type projects, those that can enhance reliability, margin enhancement type projects, then that we would be continuing to evaluate, and there are several of those projects that we\u2019ll evaluate. In terms of the timing, we\u2019re a bit early for 2024, frankly, even 2025 guidance. But let me pass it to Mike because I think he wants to give you some incremental color on how he\u2019s thinking about it.\nMike Hennigan: I think, Mary, you answered it very well. Paul, the way we think about it is on the MPLX side of the house, we\u2019ve been spending roughly about $1 billion and growing those cash flows. If you listen to the MPLX call, we\u2019re still very comfortable with those cash flows growing that will continue to kick over to MPC via distribution. And then Maryann said it well, on the refining side of the house, we\u2019re still very optimistic that we have some good projects that enable us to either increase reliability which will hit the bottom line or enhance our margins in such a way that we talked about earlier that we\u2019ll generate more EBITDA per barrel. So, we have a pretty fulsome look at where we think we\u2019re going to invest. And like Mary just gave you the numbers over the last couple of years, you\u2019re spending $2 billion to $3 billion overall on a consolidated basis. We think that\u2019s a nice base case to have. And then we always look to optimize around that. When we do that, we generate sufficient free cash flow that we can still return capital via dividends and buybacks. And as you\u2019ve seen in this enhanced margin environment, that\u2019s part of our DNA to return capital to shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Question\u2019s on the buyback, and it\u2019s kind of conceptual just sort of how you think about the stock when you do your internal process. But when you are looking at an MPC share, the question is really how do you view it, or what does it represent to you? Is it representative of just the parent company and a repository for MPLX distributions, or do you kind of analyze it as a consolidated entity where something like 40% of it is like a synthetic MPLX share. And the reason I ask is because we do get a lot of questions about sort of your price sensitivity in the buyback. And I think the methodology maybe is important.\nMaryann Mannen: Sam, it\u2019s Maryann. Let me give you a few thoughts on that, and I can pass it to Mike in case he\u2019s got some added value. I mean, there are several things that we look at as we are making decisions about the level of share buyback. And certainly, when we\u2019re looking at intrinsic value, there\u2019s a couple of approaches. So we\u2019ll look at some of the parts. We\u2019ll look at discounted cash flows. We use a series of reviews, obviously, looking at our EBITDA multiples of their respective businesses. But typically, when we are making the decision about an MPC buyback, that intrinsic value assumes the discounted cash flows, as I just shared. There are several constraints as we look at that that we evaluate each time we go to buy back stock, none the least of which obviously is market, cash flows, where we think the quarter is going to be, where we think our cash balances are. And we\u2019ve worked pretty diligently to try to outperform the market here. Hopefully, you\u2019ve seen that over the significance of the buyback that we\u2019ve done. But we do look at it in a holistic approach. Let me pass that back to Mike and see if he wants to add any color.\nMike Hennigan: Yes. Sam, here\u2019s the way I think about it. As you know, we don\u2019t control the margins. So, as the quarter progresses, we don\u2019t have a specified amount that says we\u2019re going to do x in this quarter, other than we\u2019ve been trying to be as aggressive as we possibly can within the constraints that the SEC puts on us, such as daily volume traded limitations or blackout periods, et cetera, et cetera. So, we\u2019ve been -- because it kind of looks like it\u2019s been consistent just because we\u2019ve been trying to be as aggressive as possible, once we generate the cash, as we talk to Paul\u2019s question, we have our dedication that we want to invest capital in. And then we want to be returning capital to shareholders as quickly as we can. At the same time, I will tell you that we also still try to beat the market. One of our goals is to be as aggressive as we can return capital, but take advantage of the volatility that\u2019s within the quarter. And since we started this program, we\u2019ve ended up reducing the share count by about 40%. It\u2019s a rough number. And during that process, we\u2019ve kind of beat the market by about $4. So, if you say, hey, we\u2019ve reduced somewhere around 270 million shares at around $4, it\u2019s roughly about $1 billion of value creation just in our execution. But it starts with, obviously, generate cash, figure out how much we can return to shareholders as quickly as we can within those constraints and then try our best to beat the market during that execution. I hope that helps.\nSam Margolin: Yes, very much so. Thanks. And my follow-up is just more of a straightforward ops question, but it\u2019s about the West Coast. And TMX has been delayed. But once it starts up, it might be impactful to fundamentals on the West Coast. And it seems noteworthy because of your comments about how the Midwest is this integrated system with shipper status for WCS and you\u2019re able to move things around. And so I wonder in the context of TMX, if there\u2019s -- if you see any analogs there with building out sort of a full value chain or commercial integrated platform.\nRick Hessling: Sam, it\u2019s Rick. Your analogy is spot on. So when TMX comes on line, we\u2019ll not only see benefits in the Pacific Northwest, specifically at Anacortes and at L.A. So, the way we look at it is you\u2019re going to get access to an advantaged barrel more so than what you do today. And we believe that barrel will compete very well, especially on the West Coast. We believe TMX will have some start-up issues. They have some well-publicized marine hurdles they need to get over. And with that being said, having that barrel clear all the way to Asia will be difficult. And sitting on the West Coast, we have a structural advantage from a transportation cost perspective. So, we do see that playing into both of our assets, one in the Pacific Northwest and L.A. on the West Coast.\nOperator: Next, you will hear from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: All right. I\u2019d like to come back around on the renewable diesel. We heard from others and seen some stories about permit issues. Just curious you can kind of walk us through the way we should be thinking about that as we head into start-up kind of year-end and in early part of \u201824.\nJim Wilkins: Roger, this is Jim Wilkins. We\u2019re working with the county on one issue related to our land use permit. That issue, we expect will get resolved in the upcoming months, and it\u2019s related to our odor mitigation plan. The resolution of that matter won\u2019t impact our ability to construct or operate the facility.\nRoger Read: Does it change at all the feedstock that you\u2019d be able to use early on?\nJim Wilkins: No.\nRoger Read: I\u2019m not terribly experienced with this, but I know that some of the feedstocks are -- well, let\u2019s just say, they\u2019re not what you would want to smell, I guess.\nJim Wilkins: No, Roger. So, we actually have an approved odor mitigation plan with the Air Quality Division. And actually, what we\u2019re doing is circling back to the land use permit where we said we\u2019d develop an order mitigation plan and embedding the plan that\u2019s already been approved.\nRoger Read: Okay. Perfect. And just to be absolutely clear, no other regulatory hurdles that need to be cleared for startup?\nJim Wilkins: Correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: So I had -- my first one is a follow-up on the buyback. You\u2019ve now gotten through another quarter with a really solid crack environment in 3Q and another quarter where you aren\u2019t drawing any cash. And in fact, you build cash by about, I think, $1.5 billion which I wouldn\u2019t characterize as a problem by any stretch, but you\u2019ve talked about getting that cash balance down closer to $1 billion longer term. And Mike talked about the constraints to doing more on the buyback. And now, we\u2019re seeing a worsening environment in 4Q. So, my question is, given all your excess cash, should we think about the buyback as not particularly sensitive to the crack environment? And would you expect to start drawing cash from here?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey John, it\u2019s Maryann. So, a couple of things. Yes, you\u2019re absolutely right. As you see, we said a little over $13 billion at the end of the quarter, and again, just keeping in mind, about $1 billion of that belongs to MPLX. And then obviously, there is some working capital sensitivity as we have timing of our liability payments. We would expect to see a bit of that unwind as normal. We\u2019ll see some of that happen in the fourth quarter and then again in the first quarter. Having said that, your point is accurate. We\u2019ve said we\u2019re quite comfortable with $1 billion on our balance sheet. The nice part about having the cash on the balance sheet today versus if we were sitting here a year ago is we\u2019re generating close to $0.5 billion in interest income as we\u2019re holding on to that cash. Certainly, when we are looking at the amount of share buyback that we want to do in any particular period of time, and I think Mike articulated it as well, we\u2019re looking at several factors. The fact that we\u2019ve got cash on the balance sheet to allow us to take advantage of volatility, I think, is a plus. We remain committed to share repurchase and the return of capital. We\u2019ve got some priorities, obviously, safe and reliable operation of our assets gets it first. We\u2019re committed to our dividend, as we just shared with you. And we\u2019re looking for opportunities to put that capital to work in order to be able to grow the business and particularly earn the types of returns that you all expect. And we continue to see share buyback as an efficient return of capital. So again, we\u2019ll look at all factors as we head into any particular quarter and try to be as opportunistic as we can and be sure that we are doing our best to beat the market and taking advantage of the volatility where we can.\nJohn Royall: Great. Thank you. And then Maryann called out some turnaround work pulled in from next year to the second half of this year. And so just thinking about next year, any early look on what 2024 could look like from a turnaround perspective. I think you had some catch-up over the past two years, and now this work pulled into \u201823. So, is it reasonable to think it might be kind of a below average year?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey John, Maryann again. So in general, notwithstanding the impact of COVID, if you look over an average period of time, our turnaround is pretty similar. We\u2019re operating 13 refineries, fossil fuel and two renewable diesel. And at every point in time, there is some level of turnaround. You\u2019re absolutely right. One of the things that we did, notwithstanding the unplanned downtime on the reformer is pull forward some turnaround that we expected to do in our 2024 plans into 2023. But again, absent the period of COVID, you can see the level of turnaround being pretty similar watching those. In the fourth quarter also, you may have noticed in our guidance, West Coast utilization, we do have turnaround activity there. We\u2019ve got two locations in LAR. We are trying to get those turnarounds done ahead of the driving season next year, just as an example, if you\u2019re looking at activity in the fourth quarter as well. I\u2019ll pause there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Decent amount of focus on the buyback. I wanted to ask about the dividend raise of 10%. Last year, the dividend raise was higher in line with the amount you had repurchased over the trailing 12 months. This year, that wasn\u2019t the case. And it\u2019s also, I guess, lower than the incremental cash you\u2019ll be receiving from MPLX with their higher distribution. So, the question is, how do you think about kind of that dividend raise? How did you come up with that 10%? And then how do you think about it moving forward, especially in light of the commentary that you expect the refining environment, the mid-cycle environment to be higher, and I would expect the dividend moving higher would be a good way to message that earnings power to the market.\nMike Hennigan: Jason, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019ll let Mary jump in. Yes, I think what you\u2019re referring to is we had a bigger increase before because the way we looked at it is most in our industry kind of paused around COVID during that tough year of cash. So, we made a bigger jump. And now what we\u2019re showing this year is we\u2019re trying to show the market that we believe in a growing dividend that is part of our capital allocation. We want it to be competitive. But at the same time, I often say that it\u2019s more tax efficient to go return capital through share repurchases. And the sheer quantum of dollars in each case is pretty different. So overall, we want the market to know, yes, we\u2019re going to grow the dividend. We\u2019re going to consistently do that. We want it to be competitive. We want to show that we\u2019re going to grow earnings, that comes back to investing capital and all the self-help that we can do. But at the same time, we\u2019re going to err more on the side of share repurchases because we think it\u2019s more tax efficient and a better way to return capital.\nMaryann Mannen: Jason, it\u2019s Maryann. The only thing that I would add to Mike\u2019s comments are the dividend is only one part, as you said, of the capital allocation strategy. But having said that, we think this increase is peer leading at 12% CAGR over the last five years. So, we hope you see it that as well.\nJason Gabelman: Got it. Thanks for that. And then my follow-up is on one of the growth projects that I think you have for next year, the hydrogen hub project that was selected for funding from the DOE. I was hoping just to get more color on exactly what Marathon\u2019s participation is in that project, how it could benefit the Company? Any thoughts around capital spending that you would have to contribute there?\nDave Heppner: Yes. Jason, this is Dave. I\u2019ll touch on that. So start with high level. Number one, there are 7 hubs that were approved for fund from the DOE for $7 billion. We mean MPC/MPLX, we\u2019re involved in two of them. So, one in Appalachia and one in the Heartland area. So when we think about the involvement of MPC and MPLX, they\u2019re a little bit different. On the MPLX side, it\u2019s more around story of hydrogen and transportation of CO2 on pipelines. From an MPC perspective, it is inclusive of lowering the carbon intensity via hydrogen production. And when you think about it in the Heartland area, due to the location of it\u2019s very -- the proximity very close to our Dickinson renewable diesel facility. So of course, anytime you can lower the CI of the base product you\u2019re making from renewable diesel, you can get that pull-through value of that asset that we already invested in. So, the best way to think about it, like we do everything, these are bolt-on type investments that can create value up and down the value chains.\nJason Gabelman: Okay. When should we see those benefits start to accrue when do the projects come on line?\nDave Heppner: Yes. So that\u2019s great. So, we are -- while this DOE funding was a major milestone for all of us that got granted, some funding from this, it\u2019s in the very early stages. So, to think about it, next phase of this is a negotiation with the DOE on the funding and the contractual commitments around that funding requirement, then you\u2019ve got to design and build the facility. So, from a capital spend and an associated benefit to the company, I think you\u2019re looking into late 2024, 2025 time frame. So, it\u2019s still a ways out there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: I wanted to follow up on Sam\u2019s question related to TMX for which MPC has a known commitment. And I was just wondering if you could update us with where you think the toll may settle at given the discussion with the pipeline owner and the bid/ask currently? And related to that, how much do you think really it can tighten WCS differentials for your Mid-Con assets given that coast holds are comparable to going to the U.S. Gulf Coast versus Burnaby?\nRick Hessling: Yes. Hi Theresa, it\u2019s Rick. So on the first part of your question, I\u2019m just really not in a position to comment on the toll or speculate what it may end up at. On the second part of your question, the guidance I\u2019d give you is as we look at the forward curve on WCS, so today, WCS sits at about a $26 discount. In Q1, it\u2019s plus or minus $25. And in Q2, if TMX comes online there, and I think the market is still questionable on that. The forward curve is $15 to $18 discount. So still a pretty significant discount. And we\u2019ll just have to see where it goes from there.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And going back to Mike\u2019s earlier comments about additional investment opportunities, RNG being one of them. Can you just give us an update on progress related to the LF Bioenergy assets after the Q1 acquisition announcement, how that\u2019s trending? And do you expect to use this as a launch pad for additional RNG investments, or is this going to be more of a roll up strategy from here?\nDave Heppner: Yes. Theresa, this is Dave again. I\u2019ll touch on that. So yes, the LF Bioenergy investment, that joint venture is progressing as we planned. We are building out the facilities. The plan is to build out 13 of those RNG facilities collecting a very low CI dairy RNG and then monetizing that, again, as I touched on a little bit with the hydrogen hub taking that RNG into our renewable diesel facilities such as Dickinson and Martinez, will lower the CI of that base renewable diesel product coming out. So relative to the relationship and the investment, we\u2019re very happy with the investment, the management team there, the projects we\u2019ve -- that they\u2019re identifying, they\u2019ve got a good runway of portfolio projects and they\u2019re coming on line as planned. And the second part of your question, is this a one-off or a foundation for subsequent investments in renewable diesel space or the renewable natural gas space. So, we continue, as I said earlier, we look at a lot of stuff. There are some opportunities out there. But we -- the key to this one was we got in early and didn\u2019t overpay for a built-out system. So when we think of subsequent investments, I think of them that way. If there\u2019s one that we can step in early and participate in the build-out of the infrastructure and integrate it with our business rather than paying for a built-out system, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate those opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with TPH.\nMatthew Blair: Maybe sticking with the renewables. For some operators, the next leg of the RD story is moving into SAF, is that an option for Martinez? And if so, any thoughts on timing or cost to add that flexibility?\nDave Heppner: Yes, Matthew, this is Dave again. So yes, there is no question both from a Dickinson and Martinez, both those have the opportunity to convert to SAF. And HEFA SAF is one of the most cost competitive on a CapEx per barrel basis for SAF production. With that said, the challenge in SAF is the premium associated to justify the investment. And while the IRA has been communicated, there\u2019s a lot of unknowns out there and a lot of clarity that still needs to be determined relative to the IRA, not only from the sliding scale and the CI benefit of it, but also the long-term duration. Right now, it ends in 2027, as far as the documented incentives relative to that. So it\u2019s hard to make multi-hundred million dollar investments without that clarity going forward. So lack of clarity and lack of premium from airline industry makes it very difficult to justify those investments at this time.\nMike Hennigan: Hey Matthew, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll just add to your and to Theresa\u2019s question. I think what you\u2019re trying -- or hopefully, what you\u2019re seeing from us is we\u2019re attentive to this whole low-carbon world, whether it\u2019s investment in RNG, like Theresa talked about or as Dave just mentioned, SAF, in my opinion, is going to happen at some period. As Dave said, there\u2019s a little bit of wrangling around the economics of it at this point. But when those opportunities present themselves to us, we\u2019ll continue to optimize our portfolio. So, I think if you take a stair step over time, you\u2019re going to see us continue to be conscious of that, at the same time, recognizing that the base business is still the majority of what we do. But over time, we\u2019re going to continue to look, whether it\u2019s RNG, whether it\u2019s SAF, whether it\u2019s continued build-out in some other areas, those are things that we continue to evaluate. Dave and his team is constantly looking at it, and we\u2019ll make some investment there. But we\u2019re not looking for the big splash of a major investment, as Dave just said. We\u2019re not looking to buy something that\u2019s already been proven out. We\u2019re looking to get ourselves in and grow with those opportunities.\nMatthew Blair: Sounds good. And then, do you have any early thoughts on refining margin capture into the fourth quarter? Do you think it would be up on tailwinds from things like butane blending and getting the reformer back for at least part of the quarter?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey Matthew, it\u2019s Maryann. Yes, I think it\u2019s hard for us to project capture. But when you talk about the things you did, obviously, as we shared, the reformer we expect will begin to come back up mid-November, our guidance reflects the fact that it will be operational at planned rates mid-December. We talked about some secondary headwinds. We talked about marketing margins changing. You heard Brian talk about that as well. Those things clearly have a positive influence on capture. But as you know, it\u2019s difficult to predict where capture would otherwise go. But certainly, those things point to improving capture from the third quarter.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Maybe if I could I have one follow-up on the Martinez conversion project. Can you talk about where you are from an operational point of view there? Maybe how much throughput you had in -- during the third quarter from Phase 1 of the project? And maybe as we think about startup of Phase 2 of that project by the end of this year, is there any ramp that we should associate with it, either in terms of total throughput or in terms of the type of fees that you anticipate working their way into the system? So, how should we think about the progress from an operational point of view from -- for that asset?\nTim Aydt: Okay. Ryan, this is Tim Aydt. Thanks a lot for the question there. I would say that, first off, the project is going exceptionally well, both from a safety and on-time and on-budget standpoint. The team\u2019s really done a great job, and I do want to give them a shout out because it really kind of demonstrated one of Marathon\u2019s key strengths here and that they can execute on a complex project. We did, as you likely know, we start up the pretreatment unit in late second quarter, and it is operating very well. We\u2019re able to pretreat the entire production that comes about with the Phase 1 Martinez capacity. And now we\u2019re going to be looking to ramp that pretreatment capacity with the production of RD that\u2019s coming on toward the end of the year when we finish the project. And as Maryann said earlier, when we do finish the project, we\u2019re going to be able to produce 730 million gallons annually, and that should happen by the end of the year. So, all-in-all, operationally and project wise, we\u2019re moving forward, wrapping it up, and we\u2019ll be ready at the end of the year.\nKristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you so much, everyone, today for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, please reach out, and our team will be available to take your calls. Thanks so much for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Dave Heppner",
            "content": "So, I appreciate the question. We anticipated that. And Mike said in the past, we like to and do look at everything out there as a general comment. But I think we're more focused currently on -- and Rick touched on this a little bit on opportunities to build out our competencies and increase our competitive advantages along our existing refinery value chains. And when we say that, that's inclusive of MPC and MPLX, so from wellhead to wheel is the way to think about it. So, with that said and on the current environment, we believe that M&A within refining, refining M&A is one of the more challenging ways to create value. And with all that said, I would not anticipate us, or you shouldn't anticipate us participating in the current auction process for the Citgo assets. I don't know where the rumor came from, but we're not interested in the auction process. Yes. Jason, this is Dave. I'll touch on that. So start with high level.

That issue, we expect will get resolved in the upcoming months, and it's related to our odor mitigation plan. The resolution of that matter won't impact our ability to construct or operate the facility. No. No, Roger. So, we actually have an approved odor mitigation plan with the Air Quality Division. And actually, what we're doing is circling back to the land use permit where we said we'd develop an order mitigation plan and embedding the plan that's already been approved. Correct."

            "content": "Hi, Manav. It's Rick. First of all, thank you for the perceptive callout. I will tell you we are uber-focused on EBITDA and our results compared to others. And our team will certainly greatly appreciate your callout on this as they've been working on this consistently for years now, Manav, and you're seeing it pull through to our results. So, who kudos to the team there. I will kind of backtrack and state what we've stated in past quarters, Manav. We've made structural improvements throughout our entire commercial value chain to capture value from the front end all the way through the back end. And specifically, we're doing so in a way today that is -- it is creating a mindset change within our teams, and we are, I would say, taking more calculated risk with our approach and how we look at everything. There isn't a rock that we're not overturning to see what's under it. And we're assuming, Manav, we do everything wrong. And with that mindset, you can create a lot of value, in looking at things you haven't looked at in the past. In the Midwest specifically, I will really pivot on a couple of things. We have a fully integrated system. We have four great refineries in the Midwest. In the third quarter, as you know, they ran very well. We have access to advantaged feedstocks, both Canadian and domestic, and then Brian's team has created exceptional optionality for product placement. So, when you combine all those factors together, Manav, you really get to an end result that it's been consistent, as you stated, over the last several quarters and we expect it to continue. Sam, it's Rick. Your analogy is spot on. So when TMX comes on line, we'll not only see benefits in the Pacific Northwest, specifically at Anacortes and at L.A. So, the way we look at it is you're going to get access to an advantaged barrel more so than what you do today. And we believe that barrel will compete very well, especially on the West Coast. We believe TMX will have some start-up issues. They have some well-publicized marine hurdles they need to get over. And with that being said, having that barrel clear all the way to Asia will be difficult. And sitting on the West Coast, we have a structural advantage from a transportation cost perspective. So, we do see that playing into both of our assets, one in the Pacific Northwest and L.A. on the West Coast. Yes. Hi Theresa, it's Rick. So on the first part of your question, I'm just really not in a position to comment on the toll or speculate what it may end up at. On the second part of your question, the guidance I'd give you is as we look at the forward curve on WCS, so today, WCS sits at about a $26 discount. In Q1, it's plus or minus $25. And in Q2, if TMX comes online there, and I think the market is still questionable on that. The forward curve is $15 to $18 discount. So still a pretty significant discount. And we'll just have to see where it goes from there."

            "content": "Thanks Mike. Moving to third quarter highlights, slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $8.14. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude a $106 million gain on sale of MPC's 25% interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal, as well as $63 million of response costs associated with our unplanned outage at Garyville. These adjustments reduced our reported adjusted earnings by $0.14 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion for the quarter. And cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes, was over $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we returned $297 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.8 billion of our shares. And from May 2021 through October 27th, we have repurchased 285 million shares or approximately 44% of the shares outstanding. Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second quarter 2023 to third quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially by approximately $1.2 billion, driven by higher R&M margins. Corporate expenses were higher sequentially by $40 million, primarily due to a charge related to valuation of existing performance-based stock compensation expense. The tax rate for the third quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $1 billion. Moving to our segment results, slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Our refining assets ran at 94% utilization, processing nearly 2.8 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. Sequentially, per barrel margins were higher across all regions driven by higher crack spreads. Capture was 93%. Refining operating costs were $5.14 per barrel in the third quarter, flat sequentially. We did have unplanned downtime during the quarter, impacting our two largest refineries, which resulted in lost crude throughput of 4.7 million barrels due to the Galveston Bay reformer outage and 2.1 million barrels at Garyville. Additionally, this downtime resulted in a headwind to our overall capture. We began construction activities on the reformer repair about three months after the event, once regulators gave us clearance and we were able to finalize the required repairs. Since then, repairs have progressed as planned and during this outage, we pulled forward turnaround work into the third and fourth quarters, which had been scheduled in the first quarter of 2024. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 93%. Our commercial team executed effectively, despite weak secondary product pricing and refinery downtime, which weighed on capture this quarter. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years will provide a sustainable advantage. This commitment to commercial performance is foundational and we expect to continue to see the results. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the second quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment delivered strong third quarter results. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat sequentially and 3% higher year-over-year, primarily due to higher throughputs and rates. Year-to-date, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 6% compared to the prior year period. As Mike mentioned earlier, the growth of MPLX's earnings supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by another 10% to $0.85 per unit, and MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion in cash from MPLX on an annual basis. Our Midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the quarter, operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital with over $4.3 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $609 million tailwind for the quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude oil prices. Year-to-date, working capital has been $1.4 billion worth of cash. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $486 million this quarter, consistent with our 2023 outlook. MPC returned nearly $3.1 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximately 72% payout of the $4.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. As of October 27th, we have approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization, which includes the additional $5 billion approval announced last week. At the end of third quarter, MPC had approximately $13.1 billion in consolidated cash and short term investments. This includes approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash. Turning to guidance, on slide 11, we provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 90%. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than third quarter levels due to turnaround activity having a higher impact on units in the fourth quarter. In the Gulf Coast, with respect to the Galveston Bay reformer, repairs have progressed as planned. We anticipate starting the unit back up in mid November. Production is expected to ramp over the next several weeks. And guidance anticipates returning to full operating rates by mid-December, following advanced turnaround activity. And as I mentioned earlier, during this outage, we plan to continue progressing and complete turnaround work that was previously scheduled for 2024. As a result, planned turnaround expense is now projected to be approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter. Operating costs per barrel in the fourth quarter are expected to be $5.60, higher sequentially due to higher energy cost, particularly on the West Coast, as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. With that, let me pass it back to Mike. Yes. Thank you, it's Maryann and thanks for the question. You're right. As we shared with you, we did have a couple of unplanned downtime events in the quarter that impacted the Gulf Coast. One, the most significant in terms of its contribution is the Galveston Bay reformer, and then, obviously, we had our, Garyville. Had we not had those two impacts, I'm happy to share a little bit more about those in a moment here, our capture would have been 6% higher than what we reported with the lion's share of that capture event obviously being the reformer. As I mentioned, 4.7 million barrels in the quarter that we lost, and then on Garyville, it's about 2.1 million barrels as we operated about half rate for just under a week. It took us about -- just back to, Galveston Bay for a moment. It took us about three months before, we were able to begin our work as we -- as the regulators got through their work and then we determined where all the repairs needed to be. So we were about three months, to the start of getting those, activities launched. I hope that answers the question. Sure, Paul. It's Maryann. Let me talk a little bit about CapEx in general and then I'll pass it to Mike and he'll share some incremental thoughts as well. But as you know, one of our principles, if you will, our strategic pillars is strict capital discipline. And I think that has -- hopefully you've seen that we have implemented that principle well over the last few years. When you look at 2017 to 2020, our consolidated CapEx averaged about $3.5 billion. And as you look \u201821 to \u201823, that's averaged $2.1 billion. So again that premise of strict capital discipline ensuring that we're delivering the returns has been an important piece of the work that we've been doing. I think in refining, we continue to look for cost reduction type projects, those that can enhance reliability, margin enhancement type projects, then that we would be continuing to evaluate, and there are several of those projects that we'll evaluate. In terms of the timing, we're a bit early for 2024, frankly, even 2025 guidance. But let me pass it to Mike because I think he wants to give you some incremental color on how he's thinking about it. Sam, it's Maryann. Let me give you a few thoughts on that, and I can pass it to Mike in case he's got some added value. I mean, there are several things that we look at as we are making decisions about the level of share buyback. And certainly, when we're looking at intrinsic value, there's a couple of approaches. So we'll look at some of the parts. We'll look at discounted cash flows. We use a series of reviews, obviously, looking at our EBITDA multiples of their respective businesses. But typically, when we are making the decision about an MPC buyback, that intrinsic value assumes the discounted cash flows, as I just shared. There are several constraints as we look at that that we evaluate each time we go to buy back stock, none the least of which obviously is market, cash flows, where we think the quarter is going to be, where we think our cash balances are. And we've worked pretty diligently to try to outperform the market here. Hopefully, you've seen that over the significance of the buyback that we've done. But we do look at it in a holistic approach. Let me pass that back to Mike and see if he wants to add any color. Hey John, it's Maryann. So, a couple of things. Yes, you're absolutely right. As you see, we said a little over $13 billion at the end of the quarter, and again, just keeping in mind, about $1 billion of that belongs to MPLX. And then obviously, there is some working capital sensitivity as we have timing of our liability payments. We would expect to see a bit of that unwind as normal. We'll see some of that happen in the fourth quarter and then again in the first quarter. Having said that, your point is accurate. We've said we're quite comfortable with $1 billion on our balance sheet. The nice part about having the cash on the balance sheet today versus if we were sitting here a year ago is we're generating close to $0.5 billion in interest income as we're holding on to that cash. Certainly, when we are looking at the amount of share buyback that we want to do in any particular period of time, and I think Mike articulated it as well, we're looking at several factors. The fact that we've got cash on the balance sheet to allow us to take advantage of volatility, I think, is a plus. We remain committed to share repurchase and the return of capital. We've got some priorities, obviously, safe and reliable operation of our assets gets it first. We're committed to our dividend, as we just shared with you. And we're looking for opportunities to put that capital to work in order to be able to grow the business and particularly earn the types of returns that you all expect. And we continue to see share buyback as an efficient return of capital. So again, we'll look at all factors as we head into any particular quarter and try to be as opportunistic as we can and be sure that we are doing our best to beat the market and taking advantage of the volatility where we can. Hey John, Maryann again. So in general, notwithstanding the impact of COVID, if you look over an average period of time, our turnaround is pretty similar. We're operating 13 refineries, fossil fuel and two renewable diesel. And at every point in time, there is some level of turnaround. You're absolutely right. One of the things that we did, notwithstanding the unplanned downtime on the reformer is pull forward some turnaround that we expected to do in our 2024 plans into 2023. But again, absent the period of COVID, you can see the level of turnaround being pretty similar watching those. In the fourth quarter also, you may have noticed in our guidance, West Coast utilization, we do have turnaround activity there. We've got two locations in LAR. We are trying to get those turnarounds done ahead of the driving season next year, just as an example, if you're looking at activity in the fourth quarter as well. I'll pause there. Jason, it's Maryann. The only thing that I would add to Mike's comments are the dividend is only one part, as you said, of the capital allocation strategy. But having said that, we think this increase is peer leading at 12% CAGR over the last five years. So, we hope you see it that as well. Hey Matthew, it's Maryann. Yes, I think it's hard for us to project capture. But when you talk about the things you did, obviously, as we shared, the reformer we expect will begin to come back up mid-November, our guidance reflects the fact that it will be operational at planned rates mid-December. We talked about some secondary headwinds. We talked about marketing margins changing. You heard Brian talk about that as well. Those things clearly have a positive influence on capture. But as you know, it's difficult to predict where capture would otherwise go. But certainly, those things point to improving capture from the third quarter."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Beginning with our view on the refining environment, in the third quarter, we saw strong demand and global supply tightness supporting refining margins. Diesel cracks led the barrels inventories remain tight and European distillate production ran below capacity. Globally, oil demand is at a record high as the need for affordable and reliable energy increases throughout the world. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year across the gasoline and diesel and demand for jet fuel continues to grow. Global supply remains constrained and global capacity additions have progressed at a slow pace. In the regions where we operate, seasonal butane blending has increased gasoline supply. However, we expect typical seasonal turnarounds to be supportive of cracks. To that end, we've seen 3.5 million barrels of gasoline inventory drawn out of the U.S. system over the past several weeks. OPEC+ has reduced production, adding pressure to medium sour differentials. While crude differentials have generally been narrowing, we have seen WCS widen and we're strategically situated to run heavy Canadian crude at our refineries across PADDs 2, 3 and 5. As we look towards 2024, we believe an enhanced mid-cycle environment will continue in the U.S. due to the global supply demand fundamentals and the relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Turning to our results, in the third quarter, we delivered strong cash generation across our business. In Refining & Marketing, strong margins, 94% utilization and solid commercial performance led the segment adjusted EBITDA of $4.4 billion or $16.06 per barrel. Our Midstream segment delivered durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated segment adjusted EBITDA of over $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 6% compared to the prior year period. The strength of MPLX's cash flows supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by another 10%. With this increase, MPC is expected to receive $2.2 billion of distributions from MPLX annually. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio. Its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2023 capital program. We expect MPLX's cash distribution to continue growing as it pursues growth opportunities, which will further enhance the value of this strategic relationship. We believe MPC's current capital allocation priorities are optimal for our shareholders. In the third quarter, we returned $3.1 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Last week, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization and a 10% increase to MPC's quarterly dividend. With this increase, we have grown our quarterly dividend at over 12% compound annual rate over the past five years, which has led our refining peers. Our overall capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base, while paying a secure competitive and growing dividend. We intend to grow the Company's earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline. And beyond these three priorities, we are firmly committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. Let me also share some of the progress on our low carbon initiatives. The Martinez Renewables fuel facility is being delivered safely, on time, and on budget, and by the end of 2023, the facility is expected to produce 730 million gallons per year. At that point, Martinez will be among the largest renewable diesel facilities with a competitive operating profile, robust logistics flexibility, and advantaged feedstock slate and should benefit from the global strategic relationship with Neste. Our Dickinson renewable diesel facility is operating well. The facility processed 75% advantaged feed in the third quarter. The nearby Spiritwood soybean processing plant, which is owned through a joint venture with ADM, is expected to deliver enough vegetable oil to produce approximately 75 million gallons per year of renewable diesel. Additionally, we are advancing early stage developments through our interest in low carbon intensity RNG and other small scale investments. We believe through these projects, we're taking disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture and supply to a growing and evolving market, while operating our current asset base to deliver superior cash flow and meet demands. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Maryann. In summary, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets. We'll also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. Through the third quarter, we've invested over $1.7 billion in capital and investment, which includes $390 million of maintenance capital as well as over $900 million on refinery turnarounds in 2023. Our focus on safety, operational excellence, and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture the enhanced mid-cycle environment, which we expect to continue longer term given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. MPLX remains a source of growth in our portfolio. Partnership is expected to distribute over $2.2 billion to MPC annually. And as MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it will continue to have capacity to increase its cash distributions to MPC. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice, with the strongest through cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders, supported by our firm commitment to return capital. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Manav, it's Mike. The only thing I would add to what Rick said is, we start with EBITDA per barrel. We want to make sure we're generating as much earnings as we can as we run our assets. Ultimately, though, I care the most about cash generation. I mean, it starts with EBITDA per barrel, but the bottom line is, are we generating significant amount of cash to give us the flexibility to drive shareholder returns. So, I think you hit the starting point with EBITDA per barrel. The ending point is generating cash and then having that flexibility. Yes. Doug, I'll let Brian comment on that. I'm going to let Dave start, and then I'll come back afterwards. I think, Mary, you answered it very well. Paul, the way we think about it is on the MPLX side of the house, we've been spending roughly about $1 billion and growing those cash flows. If you listen to the MPLX call, we're still very comfortable with those cash flows growing that will continue to kick over to MPC via distribution. And then Maryann said it well, on the refining side of the house, we're still very optimistic that we have some good projects that enable us to either increase reliability which will hit the bottom line or enhance our margins in such a way that we talked about earlier that we'll generate more EBITDA per barrel. So, we have a pretty fulsome look at where we think we're going to invest. And like Mary just gave you the numbers over the last couple of years, you're spending $2 billion to $3 billion overall on a consolidated basis. We think that's a nice base case to have. And then we always look to optimize around that. When we do that, we generate sufficient free cash flow that we can still return capital via dividends and buybacks. And as you've seen in this enhanced margin environment, that's part of our DNA to return capital to shareholders. Yes. Sam, here's the way I think about it. As you know, we don't control the margins. So, as the quarter progresses, we don't have a specified amount that says we're going to do x in this quarter, other than we've been trying to be as aggressive as we possibly can within the constraints that the SEC puts on us, such as daily volume traded limitations or blackout periods, et cetera, et cetera. So, we've been -- because it kind of looks like it's been consistent just because we've been trying to be as aggressive as possible, once we generate the cash, as we talk to Paul's question, we have our dedication that we want to invest capital in. And then we want to be returning capital to shareholders as quickly as we can. At the same time, I will tell you that we also still try to beat the market. One of our goals is to be as aggressive as we can return capital, but take advantage of the volatility that's within the quarter. And since we started this program, we've ended up reducing the share count by about 40%. It's a rough number. And during that process, we've kind of beat the market by about $4. So, if you say, hey, we've reduced somewhere around 270 million shares at around $4, it's roughly about $1 billion of value creation just in our execution. But it starts with, obviously, generate cash, figure out how much we can return to shareholders as quickly as we can within those constraints and then try our best to beat the market during that execution. I hope that helps. Jason, it's Mike. I'll start, and I'll let Mary jump in. Yes, I think what you're referring to is we had a bigger increase before because the way we looked at it is most in our industry kind of paused around COVID during that tough year of cash. So, we made a bigger jump. And now what we're showing this year is we're trying to show the market that we believe in a growing dividend that is part of our capital allocation. We want it to be competitive. But at the same time, I often say that it's more tax efficient to go return capital through share repurchases. And the sheer quantum of dollars in each case is pretty different. So overall, we want the market to know, yes, we're going to grow the dividend. We're going to consistently do that. We want it to be competitive. We want to show that we're going to grow earnings, that comes back to investing capital and all the self-help that we can do. But at the same time, we're going to err more on the side of share repurchases because we think it's more tax efficient and a better way to return capital. Hey Matthew, it's Mike. I'll just add to your and to Theresa's question. I think what you're trying -- or hopefully, what you're seeing from us is we're attentive to this whole low-carbon world, whether it's investment in RNG, like Theresa talked about or as Dave just mentioned, SAF, in my opinion, is going to happen at some period. As Dave said, there's a little bit of wrangling around the economics of it at this point. But when those opportunities present themselves to us, we'll continue to optimize our portfolio. So, I think if you take a stair step over time, you're going to see us continue to be conscious of that, at the same time, recognizing that the base business is still the majority of what we do. But over time, we're going to continue to look, whether it's RNG, whether it's SAF, whether it's continued build-out in some other areas, those are things that we continue to evaluate. Dave and his team is constantly looking at it, and we'll make some investment there. But we're not looking for the big splash of a major investment, as Dave just said. We're not looking to buy something that's already been proven out. We're looking to get ourselves in and grow with those opportunities."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements during the call today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as our filings with the SEC. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Beginning with our views on the macro environment, refining margins continued strong in the second quarter. Despite crack spreads incentivizing high refining utilization, product inventory levels remain low. Global capacity additions continue to progress slower than anticipated and we believe that global demand growth will remain strong. In the second half of the year, the refining outlook remains healthy. We expect year-over-year U.S. late product demand to grow consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year supported by lower energy prices and recovering air travel. This demand strength post tight inventories and receding economic headwinds are expected to continue to support elevated margins. And as we completed nearly four quarters of elevated turnaround activity early in the second quarter, we are expecting an increase in industry planned maintenance work by our peers in almost every region in which we operate. Overall, we believe an enhanced mid-cycle environment will continue in the U.S. due to relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Now turning to our results. In the second quarter, we delivered strong results across our business. In Refining & Marketing, strong margins, cost discipline and sound commercial performance led to segment adjusted EBITDA of nearly $3.2 billion. Our Midstream segment delivered durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated segment adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which is up 5% year-over-year. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC\u2019s portfolio as it anticipates growing its cash flows and increasing distributions to unitholders. MPLX\u2019s distribution MPC was $502 million this quarter, an annualized rate of over $2 billion, which fully covers MPC\u2019s current dividend and half of our planned 2023 capital program, not including MPLX. During the second quarter, we have progressed key projects such as completing the STAR project at the Galveston Bay refinery. The competitive position of our Galveston Bay refinery is enhanced by the increased residual fuel and heavy crude processing as well as distillate recovery. We are well positioned with two premier 600,000 barrel per day refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast with significant logistics and export capacity to support our global commercial strategy. At the Martinez Renewable Fuels facility, construction activities are progressing. Pre-treatment capabilities are starting to come online in the second half of 2023 and the facility is expected to be capable of producing its full capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. At that point, Martinez will be among the largest, most competitive renewable diesel facilities with a competitive operating profile, robust logistics flexibility and advantaged feedstock slate and a strategic relationship with Neste. On capital allocation, in the second quarter, we returned nearly $3.4 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. And from May 2021 through the end of July, we have repurchased 264 million shares or approximately 40% of the shares outstanding. Moving to our sustainability efforts. In July, we published our 12th annual sustainability report and our 7th annual perspectives on climate scenarios report. Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios which aligns with TCFD standards, provides insights into how we see the energy landscape, our thoughts on climate-related risks and opportunities the resources we put towards addressing them and the results that we have achieved. Our sustainability report shows continued progress on goals that we have set for ourselves, our efforts to strengthen the resiliency of our operations and to innovate for the future. At this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks Mike. Moving to second quarter highlights, Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $5.32. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations excluding favorable working capital changes was over $3.1 billion. During the quarter, we returned $316 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $3.1 billion of our shares. Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the first quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $700 million as higher refining throughput was more than offset by lower market crack spreads. Corporate expenses were roughly in line with our guidance. And despite general inflationary pressures, we have maintained cost discipline since taking $100 million out of our corporate cost since 2020. The tax rate for the second quarter was 18.4%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $583 million. Our tax provision included a $53 million discrete benefit related to prior years. Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Refining utilization increased 4% to 93% despite significant turnaround activity as plan work had a lower impact on crude units in the second quarter. During the quarter at Galveston Bay, an incident occurred at one of the refineries catalytic reformers. This unit has been out of service since May 15. This resulted in approximately 2.5 million barrels of crude throughput reduction and an approximate 1% reduction to capture. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions driven by lower crack spreads and our sour crude differentials. Capture was 97%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team, particularly given the extensive turnaround activity early in the quarter. Refining operating costs were $5.15 per barrel in the second quarter, lower sequentially and due to higher throughput and lower energy costs. Slide 8 provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 97%. Our commercial team executed effectively and achieved a strong capture result, considering a significant amount of planned and unplanned refinery downtime. Gasoline and distillate margin tailwinds were balanced against weaker secondary product pricing. We are also seeing incremental product yield and crude mix benefits from recent major capital projects. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years will provide a sustainable advantage. This commitment to commercial performance has become foundational, and we expect to see the results of this emphasis. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2023. Our midstream segment delivered strong second quarter results. Segment adjusted EBITDA while flat sequentially was 5% higher year-over-year. Our midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. These disciplined capital investments, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization are expected to grow our cash flows. This will allow us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $3.1 billion in the quarter. Working capital was an $854 million tailwind for the quarter, driven primarily by changes in crude oil and refined product inventories. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $570 million this quarter, consistent with our 2023 outlook. MPC returned nearly $3.4 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents a 100% payout of the $3.1 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment superior shareholder returns. And as of today, we have approximately $6.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $11.5 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments. Turning to guidance, slide 11. We provide our third quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 94%. Utilization is forecasted to be higher sequentially due to lower planned turnaround activity in the third quarter, and enhance mid-cycle margins, continue to incentivize high refining utilization. While we have not confirmed a start-up date, our throughput guidance assumes the reformer at the Galveston Bay refinery will be down for the entire quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $120 million in the third quarter. Operating cost per barrel in the third quarter are expected to be $5.10, as we expect to see benefits from higher throughput and lower costs, given we have completed the significant portion of our turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion for the third quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. To recap, our second quarter results reflect our team\u2019s execution against our strategic pillars across the company. Our capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure competitive dividend with the potential for growth. We want to grow the company\u2019s earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline. Beyond these 3 priorities, we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases and to meaningfully lower our share count. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Thanks, Maryann. In summary, we will continue to invest capital to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets and where we believe there are attractive returns. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve invested over $1.2 billion. Our focus on operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment. MPLX remains a source of growth in our portfolio, distributing over $2 billion to MPC annually. And as MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe we\u2019ll continue to have capacity to increase its cash contributions to MPC. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash flow generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. [Operator Instructions] And now, we will open the call. Sheila?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for having me on. Mike, I want to pick up on one of the headlines from your press release, which seems to becoming a bit of a recurring theme, sustained commercial improvements. And I guess it\u2019s a capture rate question, but can you just walk us through what\u2019s going on in your capture? Because it looks like we are \u2013 as I look back pre-COVID, for example, leaving the distortions of COVID out of it for a minute, your capture rate seems to have stepped up. Is that portfolio management? Is it something else? Is it trading? What\u2019s going on to have addressed that issue on capture rate?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, good morning, Doug. Thanks for the question. I am going to let Rick give a little more detail, but I\u2019ll start off with a couple of comments. One, we have made structural changes and have changed our commercial process quite a bit. With that said, I know yourself and a lot of the analysts like to look at that capture metric. I just want to always caution people that the metrics that I care more about is cash flow generation and earnings profitability. So I look at that much more than that capture metric, because I think there is pros and cons to it. But to your point, obviously, it has trended up and driven by a lot of the things that we have changed over the last couple of years. So I\u2019ll let Rick give a little more detail.\nRick Hessling: Yes, Doug, first off, very perceptive question. I think it\u2019s a good call out and warranted. We do believe the structural change is something that\u2019s going to stick. In fact, we continue to improve and we are never going to be done improving in this category. So it\u2019s something that we focus on daily. So in giving you an answer, I think you will respect that I will have to be broad as to not give away what I would call true competitive advantages. But it\u2019s all the buckets you\u2019ve touched on, it\u2019s optimization, it\u2019s trading, it\u2019s all of the above. And the best way I can say it, Doug, it\u2019s a holistic change in our mindset on everything we do to optimize our assets around our size, our logistics system, our knowledge, our expertise, and it\u2019s driving incremental value throughout our entire system from feedstocks to products. And there isn\u2019t anyone in the company that\u2019s not engaged. I mean I can\u2019t say enough. Our goal is to be the best cash flow generator through cycle and this just isn\u2019t a one-and-done exercise. This is the mindset that not only our commercial team, but our entire company is attacking everyday with.\nDoug Leggate: We will continue to watch it, Rick. Thanks for the color. I guess my follow-up is also a question that it\u2019s hard not to bring this up every other quarter. But Maryann, the buyback pace in July is $800 million. Your dividend at the MPC level is about 150% covered by your distributions from MPLX. Why should we not assume that buyback should be ratable at mid-cycle at that kind of level going forward?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey, Doug. Good morning. Maryann. Thanks for the question. From a capital allocation framework perspective and hopefully, even from the comments that Mike and I have both made here this morning, we remain committed to superior returns and remain committed to our capital allocation as we have defined it. As it relates to the back \u2013 as you know, each quarter now, we are trying to look as best as we can. We take a series of things into consideration. We look at market. We look at our cash flows and we try to do the best job we possibly can to maximize our ability to perform in a given quarter, as you have seen $3.1 billion in the quarter. When you look from month to month, you see that visibility as you get our quarterly documents, you see a bit of variability there. But again, we remain committed. We think share repurchase is a very efficient return of capital. As it relates to the dividend, again, an important part of our capital allocation framework, as we have shared in the past, we remain committed to that. We want it to be sustainable. We certainly want to be competitive and the opportunity to grow that as well. I hope that answers your question.\nDoug Leggate: Maryann, forgive me the clarification question, are you price agnostic because your shares are pretty much at the all-time highs you were there this year?\nMaryann Mannen: Again, Doug, we try to be as opportunistic as possible as we can in the quarter. So we hope that that\u2019s the \u2013 what you are seeing from our approach to that. So yes, we continue to buyback stock as you have seen.\nDoug Leggate: Opportunistically. Okay, thanks so much. Go ahead, Mike.\nMike Hennigan: Let me just add a couple of comments to it. As I just said to your first question, the number one concentration is to generate cash. And then I am a believer that this business has both return on and return of capital as its requirements. So on the return on, we are investing capital to improve our earnings and grow our cash flows over time, but we are also committed to return of. So we used the word strict capital discipline. We set our programs such that we are going to be able to participate in both sides of that, because I am a big believer in both. We got to show the market that we can invest capital wisely to grow our earnings, and we also want to show the market that we\u2019re returning capital to the owners. So that\u2019s a program that we\u2019ve been on for a while here a couple of years. We\u2019re going to continue in that mode. And I just want to give you a little bit more flavor as to how we look at it, but it all starts with generating cash and then optimizing return on and return of.\nDoug Leggate: Very good. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: You are welcome.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, team. I want to get your perspective on the product market. So we\u2019ve really seen a firm up here across the crack. And so any perspective you have on the strengthening \u2013 recent strengthening of margins? And then what are you seeing from a demand perspective in your own system for diesel, jet and gas?\nBrian Partee: Neil, good morning. This is Brian. Yes, let me first comment on the demand side of the equation because we are seeing the demand side of the equation really lead the crack. So on gasoline in the quarter, our system was up. And when I say our system, it\u2019s really our entire marketing book was up 4% year-on-year versus an EIA call of about 2%. This most recent week, we see continued strength. We were up 7% last week on the gasoline pool. So we continue to see the strength, which is very encouraging as we enter the back half of the driving season here. And the West Coast has been an outsized performer, 5% on the quarter, 8% last week. And then looking at diesel, it\u2019s been largely flat. EIA has got a call for the quarter of up about 1%. And of course, I think everybody has pretty dialed into Jet. We had a 9% increase on the quarter. For jet fuel demand year-on-year versus EIA of about 3%. And just real quick on the crack. I would say that the big story here over the last 30 to 60 days has been the distillate. So I mean, our view is distillate really ran up late last year, obviously, with the situation in Ukraine, uncertainty around sanctions in the first part of this year over in the EU. And now we have a lot more certainty. So the market came off pretty precipitously since the beginning of the year, and now we\u2019re seeing it recover to a more fundamental level.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, it\u2019s been notable. The follow-up is just around the dividend. It\u2019s down to about 2% given how strong stock has been perspective and just your perspective on, is there headroom to raise the fixed dividend and remind us again when you typically would do that.\nMaryann Mannen: Neil, thanks for the question. It\u2019s Maryann. So as I mentioned, hopefully, you see that we\u2019ve got a couple of criteria for the dividend obviously, yield only being one of them, sustainability of that and obviously, the potential to grow. So as we\u2019ve committed, we will be back next quarter with our intentions to share with you our plans for the dividend. So next quarter, consistent with our approach from last year as well. I hope that answers your question.\nNeil Mehta: Thans, Maryann.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: Good morning, guys. My question is like this year, you are bringing to conclusion two of your big mega projects, the Galveston as well as the Martinez RD. At this point, you haven\u2019t indicated another mega project. So should we assume in the year 2024, more of your CapEx would be dedicated to quick hit projects, which generally are not that expensive. And that can mean that year-over-year, 2024 CapEx could be down versus 2023, unless you pick up a mega project at this stage?\nMaryann Mannen: It\u2019s Maryann and thanks for the question. I think you characterized it well. As we shared with you, STAR is largely behind us. And as you heard from our comments as well, Martinez on its way to be with this next phase up and running by the end of the quarter. As you know, we\u2019re a bit early to give 2024 guidance. We will get a little bit closer to that and give you some more color we intend to give you, as we have in prior quarters, to look at what we would be contemplating spending in refining as well as our low-carbon initiatives as well. But I think you stated it well. We haven\u2019t talked about any significant major projects here to for. Hope that helps.\nMike Hennigan: Manav, this is Mike. I just want to add. It\u2019s just a little early in the year. We obviously have some insight as to what we\u2019re planning to do in \u201824, but we will talk about that in subsequent quarters as opposed to now.\nManav Gupta: I completely understand. My quick follow-up here is, as I understand, when you first envisioned the Martinez project, it was more of so being refined and refined. As you brought in the partner somewhere your own thought process or what you want to run changed. And at this stage, you are looking at a higher percentage of lower CIS stocks versus soybean. Can you comment a little bit on that?\nBrian Partee: Yes, Manav, this is Brian. Certainly, you got it pretty dead on there in terms of the strategy and the strategic relationship we have with Neste. Just a couple of things to mention around your question, though, that we are on start-up diet here. So as mentioned, we\u2019ve got our pretreatment facility coming online and really full horsepower of this facility really enters in the back half of this year, but we\u2019re quite confident in our ability with our relationship with Neste that really is looking beyond just Martinez. This is just the beginning of our relationship. But one point of view that I will share with you, not Martina specific, but to give just a little bit of perspective, we just exited July with our operation up in Dickinson, and we ran a 74% advantaged feed slate out of our facility up in Dickinson. And its start-up design was very similar to Martinez. So hopefully, that frames things up for you a little bit better of what to expect when we get Martinez up to full rate later this year.\nMike Hennigan: Manav, it\u2019s Mike. I just want to add that when we look at the project, we try and challenge ourselves as Brian said, without the advantaged feedstock to make sure we\u2019re comfortable that we have a good project even in that conservative nature. And then obviously, the commercial teams are going to work very hard to optimize the feedstocks whether it\u2019s to our other refineries or to the RD facilities. But we try and start out before we deploy that capital in such a way that we feel comfortable that we\u2019ll have upside as we do better commercially on the feedstock side.\nManav Gupta: Thank you so much.\nMike Hennigan: You are welcome.\nOperator: Next, you will hear from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Hi, thank you. Hey, guys. Good morning. I think in the past, you said if we\u2019re looking at your refining portfolio, cars and they see the biggest potential upside. So \u2013 is there any kind of investment initiative that are you currently thinking on that to capture that upside? That\u2019s the first question. Second question that maybe this is for Rick. When I\u2019m looking at the third quarter, your throughput guidance, which has actually come in that to be about exactly the same as the second quarter, but the turnaround activity is significantly lower. So are we missing something? Or is number is just being very conservative, that one we had thought with the turnaround activity is much lower you will have a much higher throughput than the second quarter. Thank you.\nMike Hennigan: Paul, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll start on the first one, I\u2019ll let Rick take the second one. Similar to Manuv\u2019s question is \u2013 we\u2019ll give a little more color on 2024 capital in the next couple of quarters. We do have some projects that we think will continue to optimize our portfolio and improve upon it. But like I said a few minutes ago, it\u2019s a little early to talk about that capital at this point. So if you can just hold your thought, we\u2019ll give a little bit more on the next quarter and start to give you a little bit more insight as to what we\u2019re thinking in \u201824.\nRick Hessling: Yes. Hi, Paul, it\u2019s Rick. So on our throughput guidance for 3Q, you\u2019re correct, it is lighter than 2Q, and we see that as an advantage, especially as a lot of our competitors have heavier turnaround work in 3Q. But with that being said, Paul, I think the one difference maybe that you\u2019re not accounting for is the reformer outage. So when you factor that in, that\u2019s really takes you to where we landed in our guidance, Paul. That\u2019s really the only difference.\nPaul Cheng: Where can I clarify on that because the reformer was done since in mid-May \u2013 and so this is only going to be I think maybe half of our quarter of the down timing. So that what dropped you 30,000, 40,000 barrels per day in total throughput. So \u2013 and it still is a really be surprised that the book level is not higher on the guidance for third quarter.\nMaryann Mannen: Hey, Paul, it\u2019s Maryann. Let me try to provide incremental color into all the commentary that Rick has given you. So you\u2019re right, in the second quarter, the reformer was down from May 15 to the end of the quarter. For purposes of guidance in this quarter, what we have assumed is we would not be operational at all. So it\u2019s about 75,000 a day, when we talk about the impact last quarter, it was about 1%. If you look at the impact, just strictly in the U.S. Gulf Coast from the absence of that particular unit not operating, it\u2019s about a 7% reduction quarter-over-quarter in U.S. Gulf Coast, and that\u2019s about a 3% overall to the whole system. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful to you.\nPaul Cheng: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSam Margolin: Hi, everyone. Thanks for calling my name. This is a macro question, and I want to harken back to a call, a Marathon call from earlier this year. I think it was Brian made the prediction that the Russian sanctions first diesel cracks will go down and then they would go up again. And that\u2019s sort of exactly what happened and it has to do with the destock pattern and then later on, specification issues. And so I just want to bring that comment back to the service here and see if it is part of the reason for the strength we\u2019re seeing in diesel cracks now and if you see in your export markets, for example, if you see a shortage of on-spec products that\u2019s driving some of the strength there?\nBrian Partee: Hey, Sam. Good to hear from you. Yes, absolutely. We are seeing things played out as we expected. I mentioned it earlier. I think the big thing with the Russian situation was the uncertainty, and I think the market has become much more certain today for all of us in terms of really limited friction on Russian distillate barrels hitting the world market. We have seen a little bit of market share exchange, deeper penetration of Russian barrels into Latin America, notably Brazil, an exchange share for the U.S. system into Europe. So we\u2019re seeing here in the last couple of months, almost 300,000 barrels a day of distillate exports to backfill the European market. And what we\u2019re hearing from customers over in Europe is really energy security. No surprise is a big driving factor for them. So with our team over in London right now, operating really, really strong, we are finding really good traction for our book over into Europe. But to your broader question on demand, the export market has been very stable and strong for many cycles now and continues to be our outlook going forward, the case on both gasoline and distillate.\nSam Margolin: Okay, thanks. And then this is an operational follow-up, but we\u2019ve seen heavy intermediate differentials compress and it seems to correspond to a bunch of different factors, maybe starting up as one of them, but \u2013 there\u2019s a couple of other similar new conversion units and new refining capacity starting up concurrently. And then you have the OPEC cuts. And so just on this heavy light set up and specifically on high-sulfur fuel oil, this is the tightness here just a function of all of these things happening at once. And then over time, the market will adjust and we might see just if I go back towards where it was? Or is this kind of the normalization with all the new capacity? Thanks.\nBrian Partee: Yes, Sam, this is Brian. A couple of data points on that. So if you look at the heavy sulfur distillate spread. Of course, we swung real, real low last year. And of course, the system was in max distillate mode. So we were producing we, the whole entire refining complex is producing as much diesel as possible, which generated more high sulfur distillate, which outran hydrotreating capacity by and large, as we\u2019ve come off of MAX diesel mode, and we\u2019ve been in gasoline mode here as a system this summer. We\u2019ve seen that retrench. So more of a traditional relationship. So I think the factor to look at is really, are we in MAX gas or MAX diesel load. Some of the things you mentioned are nominally impactful. But if you\u2019re looking specifically at the Gulf Coast, the one kind of watch out is it\u2019s a very thinly traded market, so it can move quite dramatically up or down depending on what\u2019s occurring in the system.\nSam Margolin: Thanks so much.\nRick Hessling: Hey, Sam, this is Rick. Just to tag on to what Brian was saying, as part of your question, the heavy light crude differentials. So \u2013 we do believe the bottom is in. We\u2019re actually quite optimistic. We believe that spread will get wider point forward through the end of this year. And it\u2019s really for a variety of reasons. You\u2019ve got increased planned turnaround work specifically in PADD 2 and 3 that\u2019s going to take some crude demand needs off the table. So that will cause some length. You\u2019ve got the Canadian producers that have come out of their maintenance season, and they are running well. And then you\u2019ve got incremental Gulf of Mexico and Venezuela production from Chevron clearing to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So when we look at the markers and specifically, Sam on heavy Canadian, it hit its low in around June at about a $10 discount. The current trade cycles got it at about a $14 discount. So it\u2019s widened out even significantly here over the last 30 days. And we continue to see it widening out further when you look at the forward curve between now and the end of the year.\nSam Margolin: Got it. Thank you so much.\nRick Hessling: You are welcome, Sam.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nJason Gabelman: Yes. Hey, thanks for taking my question. I want to key in on a couple of macro comments Mike made on the top of the call. I was hoping you could elaborate. First, he mentioned higher maintenance moving forward in almost every region that you operate in. It sounded like from Rick\u2019s answer just now that was going to be impact you in PADD 2 and PADD 3. So one, can you confirm that? And is that higher maintenance sequentially? Or is it higher than what you would typically expect in the fall? And then secondly, on the macro, you mentioned some refinery startups globally are a bit delayed. I was wondering if there are any sites, in particular, that you had in mind? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Jason, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll start, and then I\u2019ll let Rick jump in. What I was saying in the prepared remarks is we as a company have gone through four quarters of pretty heavy turnaround. And so we\u2019re later into the rest of the year, compared to what we see as the industry, and we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out, but it looks like the industry has a lot more activity into the rest of the year. So that\u2019s what I was trying to say as far as the difference between where we are and where we think the rest of the industry is.\nRick Hessling: Yes. And then I\u2019ll just tag on. In terms of global refining capacity, what we found, and it appears to continue to be true is over-promise and under-deliver. So generally speaking, I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to give you specifics. But generally speaking, we\u2019re seeing delays versus others throughout the world, meeting their projections of when that \u2013 when their utilization is going to come online. So, more of a general comment.\nJason Gabelman: Okay. Great. And my follow-up is on the Martinez biofuels projects. I just wanted to confirm because it\u2019s tough to tell. It sounds like everything is going according to plan, but we\u2019ve heard from industry sources that there are some court challenges that you\u2019re having to address. Is that fair in terms of what\u2019s going on? And is there any risk that any of these court challenges could impact the ramp up of the project to the full 730 million gallons?\nRick Hessling: So there were six challenges to our land use permit. We prevailed on five of them. And the one is currently still being briefed with the court, and we anticipate a favorable outcome here in the upcoming months. So nothing projected to impact construction and/or operation.\nJason Gabelman: To clarify, you need \u2013 can you ramp up while that court is ongoing, while our case is ongoing or would you need that to be resolved before you ramp up capacity?\nRick Hessling: No. We can continue both on construction and with the operation.\nJason Gabelman: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: Thank you and good morning. I\u2019d like to follow up as well on Martinez. Maybe just if you can help us out with understanding some of the milestones we should watch. We know that the industry has been challenging times to get these facilities to start up cleanly. You have obviously put out a goal of full run rate by the end of the year. So, as we think about this point in late October, looking back at the third quarter, where would you expect to see that unit? And when would you anticipate that it becomes a positive contributor in terms of EBITDA, cash flow, earnings?\nTimothy Aydt: Roger, this is Tim. I will take that question. So, first off, the remaining construction activities at Martinez, they are on schedule and things are going very well. As both Brian and Mike indicated early on in the prepared remarks and the Q&A, we recently started up a portion of the Martinez pretreatment unit. And we are now pre-treating on-site with one train that will really just support the Phase 1 volumes. The big ticket item, though is when we ramp up with the second train at the end of the year when we bring alongside the RD capacity when the facility conversion is complete. So, I would give it positive remarks. Team is doing a great job and we look forward to the end of the year.\nMike Hennigan: And Roger, it\u2019s Mike. To your question, financially, you got to be thinking into \u201824. As Tim said, we are ramping, we are starting up. We are going to bring on the additional units and if all goes well, we will be on by the end of the year. So, you will start to see the financial performance more in \u201824 on a go-forward basis.\nRoger Read: That makes sense. And then maybe this question is for Maryann. Dickinson is a very small operation, so I understand as part of refining, but now that it\u2019s going to be a much bigger overall operation, Granted, you own half of it via the Neste joint venture, but how should we think about from a reporting accounting standpoint, when are \u2013 or will we see a breakout of renewable diesel operations from the rest of the business?\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks for the question, Roger. As you said, as it relates to Dickinson first, we have been operating for about 2 years and consistent with the way we have expected profitability there. Although some of the moving parts are different, we continue to see the performance of that consistent with what we thought. Mike just shared with you when we should expect to see real contribution from Martinez. So, we will evaluate both Dickinson and Martinez in terms of their total contribution. As you know, we have said for 2023, we are not planning to break that out. But we will come back to you as we continue to move along our path of profitability for both Dickinson and Martinez.\nMike Hennigan: And Roger, it\u2019s Mike. The other thing and I know you know this already, but obviously, the refining assets cash flows are significantly higher than what\u2019s happening in renewable diesel. I think the way you should think about that is, us looking at all our assets, and we talk about portfolio optimization to take two assets that we did not think would be competitive long-term and deserving of investing capital and it put them in a positive cash flow mode going forward, obviously, in a diesel mode as opposed to a crude mode. So, I think it\u2019s more of a portfolio optimization realization compared to where we are on refining cash flows.\nRoger Read: Well, I will just leave you with my final thoughts on it, which is we haven\u2019t really put a lot in valuation uplift because it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what some of the contributions will be and where. So, I think more disclosure will be a positive for you.\nMike Hennigan: Okay. I appreciate that feedback. Thank you.\nMaryann Mannen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn Royall: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question is just coming back to the Galveston Bay reformer. Is there an update on when we could see that coming back? I know you are assuming out for the full quarter with 3Q guidance, but maybe just a little bit of color on where you are in that restart process beyond just that assumption in your guidance.\nTimothy Aydt: So John, this is Tim. I will take part of that. And all I can really share is that we are expeditiously and prudently completing the repairs on that unit. And we don\u2019t have any further guidance beyond what Maryann has already provided relative to schedule.\nJohn Royall: Okay. Fair enough. And my next question is on tax. You had a very low rate in 2Q. You called out a $50 million-ish of that looks non-recurring. But even when I adjust for that, it\u2019s still trending down the past couple of quarters. Is that just on the mix of non-taxable MPLX versus refining, with refining coming down past couple of quarters? Are there any other moving pieces to think about in the tax rate?\nMaryann Mannen: Hey John, it\u2019s Maryann. Yes, thanks for that. So, as we stated, the $53 million that I called out for you is related to prior periods. It\u2019s a good news story. We were successful on a resolution of an item that has prior period benefit, and it will have some, but all bet smaller benefit going forward. And that\u2019s about $0.13 in the quarter. As you have stated, typically the biggest mover on our rate is the relationship between our midstream business and our refining business. But from time-to-time, we could also have discrete items. Those items could be positive or negative. And in some cases, they are positive. But as you stated, the typical driver there, when you look at our Federal rate and the State tax rate would be that relationship.\nJohn Royall: So, if I adjusted out the $53 million in this quarter, that\u2019s a decent run rate to think about going forward?\nMaryann Mannen: One of the things that you have said when you look at that rate, it\u2019s a little bit lower than average. I think you are probably coming to around a 20% ZIP code in the quarter. As you have seen from last year, we have run about 22%. So, there is a range there, but certainly, 20% is at the lower end of that when you look at the relationships between refining and midstream today.\nJohn Royall: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just had a quick follow-up related to the discussion of the Martinez ramp up and your renewable diesel outlook in general. Related to the economics of LCFS, it seems that the final draft of the proposed changes will be submitted to CARB over the next couple of months. And I would love to hear your thoughts and expectations on where you see that landing and your general outlook for pricing from here?\nBrian Partee: Theresa, good morning. This is Brian. Yes, so we have been very actively involved with CARB on the valuation of the reset. We remain optimistic. We believe CARB foundationally wants to find a way to support the program. Obviously, LCFS prices have come off fairly precipitously over the last couple of years as RD has penetrated. So, we are expecting support for the market. But note, LCFS is the smallest variable in our overall value equation. So, it\u2019s not been a big needle mover, but we do think it\u2019s important going forward to underpin the profitability on the RD space. In addition, obviously, we are looking at markets beyond California. So, as LCFS prices come down in California, there is other state-level programs on the West Coast and beyond that we are finding opportunities to penetrate with our RD market position.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matthew Blair with TPH. Your may proceed.\nMatthew Blair: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. Chicago diesel cracks were quite weak earlier in July, even related to other PADD 2 markets like Group III. Do you have any color on what was going on here? It looks like they recovered so far, but any color as to why Chicago Diesel at one point was negative on an RBO adjusted basis?\nBrian Partee: Yes. Matthew, this is Brian. Yes, it\u2019s a great question. Clearly, overdone. It\u2019s recovered fully. The unique nature of the Chicago Complex is the marker is in the far west side of Chicago, which from time-to-time can get pretty volatile. And I think really, that\u2019s what we saw from a trade basis over on the west side of Chicago, but it\u2019s recovered quite nicely here as we have trended out of that period of time. And we remain optimistic that we are in a good position as we head into the harvest season here in the Midwest where we expect to see distillate strength.\nMatthew Blair: It sounds good. And then on the CARB data posted last night, it showed that in the first quarter of this year, California diesel consumption was 49% RD and up to 8% be the \u2013 for your Los Angeles refinery, are you having any problems placing your petroleum diesel volumes in that California market? And are you having to export new volumes to Singapore or Mexico? Do you consider that a risk down the road?\nBrian Partee: Yes, Matthew, this is Brian. On the prop basis, no problems clearing the barrels. But yes, you are on point there. As RD penetrates the California market, it\u2019s a one-for-one relationship. It\u2019s fairly balanced. I will say the West Coast system as a whole, that our expectation and planning horizon does include the ability to make sure that we can export barrels beyond the U.S. In addition, obviously, jet is very, very strong right now. So, if you look at the yield structure in terms of how we are running the refineries, we are working really, really hard to make sure that we are maximizing jet fuel at the cost of the distillate side of the book.\nMatthew Blair: Great. Thank you.\nBrian Partee: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. We do have time for just one more question. Our last question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRyan Todd: Okay. Thanks. Maybe a question on the refining side, on the Gulf Coast, you had very strong performance despite the downtime at the reformer at Galveston Bay. Can you \u2013 I am curious as to how much contribution you saw from the STAR expansion in the quarter? And maybe just an update on how the expansion of that project is going forward and contribution in the future?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ryan. It\u2019s Maryann. Let me try to give you a little bit of color. When you look at Q1 to Q2 performance, keep in mind in the U.S. Gulf Coast, as you stated, we were under turnaround in the first quarter and obviously ramping up. So, you saw the benefits of that, obviously, in the second quarter despite the fact that we did have the reformer down for just a portion of the month. As I was commenting on, it\u2019s only about a 1% impact for the second quarter that will get a little bit larger, as I shared, given the fact that we are assuming it to be down. I think the other thing to keep in mind is typically when we look at cost in the quarter, when we are doing heavy turnarounds, as we did in the first quarter, we are typically doing other maintenance work and that was much lighter in the second quarter as well. As it relates to STAR, as you know, we were ramping up our comments as we have been sharing STAR was ramping up through the second quarter. So, minimal impact with respect to STAR, but you will begin to see that now as we have reached the completion of that project.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thank you, Maryann. And maybe just kind of a high-level question, you have obviously been active today in various low-carbon transportation fuels, meaningful investment in renewable diesel, even a recent investment in an RNG producer. As you look at the long-term outlook for transportation fuels in your markets over the next 10 years, how are you thinking about your overall strategy for the transition? In particular, maybe a sense of your role in a broader definition of transportation fuels. And where do you go from here in terms of potential future investments?\nMike Hennigan: Yes, Ryan, it\u2019s Mike. I like the word energy evolution more than energy transition. I know a lot of people use energy transition, but I think it\u2019s going to evolve over a longer period of time than most have written about. So we\u2019re trying to be very thoughtful. We will using the word evolve. We will evolve the company over time. As you pointed out, 2 of our facilities now are renewable diesel. We made a small investment in an RNG facility. So Dave and his team are looking at all those opportunities. We talked on the call today about we\u2019re active in some of the DOE hydrogen hubs, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out over time. So think of us as going to be very thoughtful. We try to use the word strict capital discipline. We do want to invest as opportunities present themselves, but we are committed to getting solid returns. So overall, I\u2019d say you\u2019re just going to see us chip away at little activities over time and constantly evolve it to your point about, what are we going to look like in 10 years? And 10 years, 20 years or whatever Marathon has been around for 130 years. We plan to be around for 130 more. So we\u2019ll evolve the company as the market dictates. And obviously, consumer preferences, regulatory impacts, all those things are going to drive what happens and we\u2019ll be very attentive to it and we\u2019ll look to deploy capital as we see the opportunities.\nKristina Kazarian: Alright. Well, thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, please reach out a member of our Investor Relations team will be here to help today. Thank you so much, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you once again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Brian Partee",
            "content": "Neil, good morning. This is Brian. Yes, let me first comment on the demand side of the equation because we are seeing the demand side of the equation really lead the crack. So on gasoline in the quarter, our system was up. And when I say our system, it's really our entire marketing book was up 4% year-on-year versus an EIA call of about 2%. This most recent week, we see continued strength. We were up 7% last week on the gasoline pool. So we continue to see the strength, which is very encouraging as we enter the back half of the driving season here. And the West Coast has been an outsized performer, 5% on the quarter, 8% last week. And then looking at diesel, it's been largely flat. EIA has got a call for the quarter of up about 1%. And of course, I think everybody has pretty dialed into Jet. We had a 9% increase on the quarter. For jet fuel demand year-on-year versus EIA of about 3%. And just real quick on the crack. I would say that the big story here over the last 30 to 60 days has been the distillate. So I mean, our view is distillate really ran up late last year, obviously, with the situation in Ukraine, uncertainty around sanctions in the first part of this year over in the EU. And now we have a lot more certainty. So the market came off pretty precipitously since the beginning of the year, and now we're seeing it recover to a more fundamental level. Yes, Manav, this is Brian. Certainly, you got it pretty dead on there in terms of the strategy and the strategic relationship we have with Neste. Just a couple of things to mention around your question, though, that we are on start-up diet here. So as mentioned, we've got our pretreatment facility coming online and really full horsepower of this facility really enters in the back half of this year, but we're quite confident in our ability with our relationship with Neste that really is looking beyond just Martinez. This is just the beginning of our relationship. But one point of view that I will share with you, not Martina specific, but to give just a little bit of perspective, we just exited July with our operation up in Dickinson, and we ran a 74% advantaged feed slate out of our facility up in Dickinson. And its start-up design was very similar to Martinez. So hopefully, that frames things up for you a little bit better of what to expect when we get Martinez up to full rate later this year. Hey, Sam. Good to hear from you. Yes, absolutely. We are seeing things played out as we expected. I mentioned it earlier. I think the big thing with the Russian situation was the uncertainty, and I think the market has become much more certain today for all of us in terms of really limited friction on Russian distillate barrels hitting the world market. We have seen a little bit of market share exchange, deeper penetration of Russian barrels into Latin America, notably Brazil, an exchange share for the U.S. system into Europe. So we're seeing here in the last couple of months, almost 300,000 barrels a day of distillate exports to backfill the European market. And what we're hearing from customers over in Europe is really energy security. No surprise is a big driving factor for them. So with our team over in London right now, operating really, really strong, we are finding really good traction for our book over into Europe. But to your broader question on demand, the export market has been very stable and strong for many cycles now and continues to be our outlook going forward, the case on both gasoline and distillate. Yes, Sam, this is Brian. A couple of data points on that. So if you look at the heavy sulfur distillate spread. Of course, we swung real, real low last year. And of course, the system was in max distillate mode. So we were producing we, the whole entire refining complex is producing as much diesel as possible, which generated more high sulfur distillate, which outran hydrotreating capacity by and large, as we've come off of MAX diesel mode, and we've been in gasoline mode here as a system this summer. We've seen that retrench. So more of a traditional relationship. So I think the factor to look at is really, are we in MAX gas or MAX diesel load. Some of the things you mentioned are nominally impactful. But if you're looking specifically at the Gulf Coast, the one kind of watch out is it's a very thinly traded market, so it can move quite dramatically up or down depending on what's occurring in the system. Theresa, good morning. This is Brian. Yes, so we have been very actively involved with CARB on the valuation of the reset. We remain optimistic. We believe CARB foundationally wants to find a way to support the program. Obviously, LCFS prices have come off fairly precipitously over the last couple of years as RD has penetrated.

            "content": "Roger, this is Tim. I will take that question. So, first off, the remaining construction activities at Martinez, they are on schedule and things are going very well. As both Brian and Mike indicated early on in the prepared remarks and the Q&A, we recently started up a portion of the Martinez pretreatment unit. And we are now pre-treating on-site with one train that will really just support the Phase 1 volumes. The big ticket item, though is when we ramp up with the second train at the end of the year when we bring alongside the RD capacity when the facility conversion is complete. So, I would give it positive remarks. Team is doing a great job and we look forward to the end of the year. So John, this is Tim. I will take part of that. And all I can really share is that we are expeditiously and prudently completing the repairs on that unit. And we don't have any further guidance beyond what Maryann has already provided relative to schedule."

            "name": "Rick Hessling",
            "content": "Yes, Doug, first off, very perceptive question. I think it's a good call out and warranted. We do believe the structural change is something that's going to stick. In fact, we continue to improve and we are never going to be done improving in this category. So it's something that we focus on daily. So in giving you an answer, I think you will respect that I will have to be broad as to not give away what I would call true competitive advantages. But it's all the buckets you've touched on, it's optimization, it's trading, it's all of the above. And the best way I can say it, Doug, it's a holistic change in our mindset on everything we do to optimize our assets around our size, our logistics system, our knowledge, our expertise, and it's driving incremental value throughout our entire system from feedstocks to products. And there isn't anyone in the company that's not engaged. I mean I can't say enough. Our goal is to be the best cash flow generator through cycle and this just isn't a one-and-done exercise. This is the mindset that not only our commercial team, but our entire company is attacking everyday with. Yes. Hi, Paul, it's Rick. So on our throughput guidance for 3Q, you're correct, it is lighter than 2Q, and we see that as an advantage, especially as a lot of our competitors have heavier turnaround work in 3Q. But with that being said, Paul, I think the one difference maybe that you're not accounting for is the reformer outage. So when you factor that in, that's really takes you to where we landed in our guidance, Paul. That's really the only difference. Hey, Sam, this is Rick. Just to tag on to what Brian was saying, as part of your question, the heavy light crude differentials. So \u2013 we do believe the bottom is in. We're actually quite optimistic. We believe that spread will get wider point forward through the end of this year. And it's really for a variety of reasons. You've got increased planned turnaround work specifically in PADD 2 and 3 that's going to take some crude demand needs off the table. So that will cause some length. You've got the Canadian producers that have come out of their maintenance season, and they are running well. And then you've got incremental Gulf of Mexico and Venezuela production from Chevron clearing to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So when we look at the markers and specifically, Sam on heavy Canadian, it hit its low in around June at about a $10 discount. The current trade cycles got it at about a $14 discount. So it's widened out even significantly here over the last 30 days. And we continue to see it widening out further when you look at the forward curve between now and the end of the year. You are welcome, Sam. Yes. And then I'll just tag on. In terms of global refining capacity, what we found, and it appears to continue to be true is over-promise and under-deliver. So generally speaking, I really don't think it's appropriate to give you specifics. But generally speaking, we're seeing delays versus others throughout the world, meeting their projections of when that \u2013 when their utilization is going to come online. So, more of a general comment. So there were six challenges to our land use permit. We prevailed on five of them. And the one is currently still being briefed with the court, and we anticipate a favorable outcome here in the upcoming months. So nothing projected to impact construction and/or operation. No. We can continue both on construction and with the operation."

            "name": "Maryann Mannen",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Moving to second quarter highlights, Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $5.32. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations excluding favorable working capital changes was over $3.1 billion. During the quarter, we returned $316 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $3.1 billion of our shares. Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the first quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $700 million as higher refining throughput was more than offset by lower market crack spreads. Corporate expenses were roughly in line with our guidance. And despite general inflationary pressures, we have maintained cost discipline since taking $100 million out of our corporate cost since 2020. The tax rate for the second quarter was 18.4%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $583 million. Our tax provision included a $53 million discrete benefit related to prior years. Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Refining utilization increased 4% to 93% despite significant turnaround activity as plan work had a lower impact on crude units in the second quarter. During the quarter at Galveston Bay, an incident occurred at one of the refineries catalytic reformers. This unit has been out of service since May 15. This resulted in approximately 2.5 million barrels of crude throughput reduction and an approximate 1% reduction to capture. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions driven by lower crack spreads and our sour crude differentials. Capture was 97%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team, particularly given the extensive turnaround activity early in the quarter. Refining operating costs were $5.15 per barrel in the second quarter, lower sequentially and due to higher throughput and lower energy costs. Slide 8 provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 97%. Our commercial team executed effectively and achieved a strong capture result, considering a significant amount of planned and unplanned refinery downtime. Gasoline and distillate margin tailwinds were balanced against weaker secondary product pricing. We are also seeing incremental product yield and crude mix benefits from recent major capital projects. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years will provide a sustainable advantage. This commitment to commercial performance has become foundational, and we expect to see the results of this emphasis. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2023. Our midstream segment delivered strong second quarter results. Segment adjusted EBITDA while flat sequentially was 5% higher year-over-year. Our midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. These disciplined capital investments, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization are expected to grow our cash flows. This will allow us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $3.1 billion in the quarter. Working capital was an $854 million tailwind for the quarter, driven primarily by changes in crude oil and refined product inventories. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $570 million this quarter, consistent with our 2023 outlook. MPC returned nearly $3.4 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents a 100% payout of the $3.1 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment superior shareholder returns. And as of today, we have approximately $6.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $11.5 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments. Turning to guidance, slide 11. We provide our third quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 94%. Utilization is forecasted to be higher sequentially due to lower planned turnaround activity in the third quarter, and enhance mid-cycle margins, continue to incentivize high refining utilization. While we have not confirmed a start-up date, our throughput guidance assumes the reformer at the Galveston Bay refinery will be down for the entire quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $120 million in the third quarter. Operating cost per barrel in the third quarter are expected to be $5.10, as we expect to see benefits from higher throughput and lower costs, given we have completed the significant portion of our turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion for the third quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. To recap, our second quarter results reflect our team's execution against our strategic pillars across the company. Our capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure competitive dividend with the potential for growth. We want to grow the company's earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline. Beyond these 3 priorities, we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases and to meaningfully lower our share count. With that, let me pass it back to Mike. Hey, Doug. Good morning. Maryann. Thanks for the question. From a capital allocation framework perspective and hopefully, even from the comments that Mike and I have both made here this morning, we remain committed to superior returns and remain committed to our capital allocation as we have defined it. As it relates to the back \u2013 as you know, each quarter now, we are trying to look as best as we can. We take a series of things into consideration. We look at market. We look at our cash flows and we try to do the best job we possibly can to maximize our ability to perform in a given quarter, as you have seen $3.1 billion in the quarter. When you look from month to month, you see that visibility as you get our quarterly documents, you see a bit of variability there. But again, we remain committed. We think share repurchase is a very efficient return of capital. As it relates to the dividend, again, an important part of our capital allocation framework, as we have shared in the past, we remain committed to that. We want it to be sustainable. We certainly want to be competitive and the opportunity to grow that as well. I hope that answers your question. Again, Doug, we try to be as opportunistic as possible as we can in the quarter. So we hope that that's the \u2013 what you are seeing from our approach to that. So yes, we continue to buyback stock as you have seen. Neil, thanks for the question. It's Maryann. So as I mentioned, hopefully, you see that we've got a couple of criteria for the dividend obviously, yield only being one of them, sustainability of that and obviously, the potential to grow. So as we've committed, we will be back next quarter with our intentions to share with you our plans for the dividend. So next quarter, consistent with our approach from last year as well. I hope that answers your question. It's Maryann and thanks for the question. I think you characterized it well. As we shared with you, STAR is largely behind us. And as you heard from our comments as well, Martinez on its way to be with this next phase up and running by the end of the quarter. As you know, we're a bit early to give 2024 guidance. We will get a little bit closer to that and give you some more color we intend to give you, as we have in prior quarters, to look at what we would be contemplating spending in refining as well as our low-carbon initiatives as well. But I think you stated it well. We haven't talked about any significant major projects here to for. Hope that helps. Hey, Paul, it's Maryann. Let me try to provide incremental color into all the commentary that Rick has given you. So you're right, in the second quarter, the reformer was down from May 15 to the end of the quarter. For purposes of guidance in this quarter, what we have assumed is we would not be operational at all. So it's about 75,000 a day, when we talk about the impact last quarter, it was about 1%. If you look at the impact, just strictly in the U.S. Gulf Coast from the absence of that particular unit not operating, it's about a 7% reduction quarter-over-quarter in U.S. Gulf Coast, and that's about a 3% overall to the whole system. So hopefully, that's helpful to you. Thanks for the question, Roger. As you said, as it relates to Dickinson first, we have been operating for about 2 years and consistent with the way we have expected profitability there. Although some of the moving parts are different, we continue to see the performance of that consistent with what we thought. Mike just shared with you when we should expect to see real contribution from Martinez. So, we will evaluate both Dickinson and Martinez in terms of their total contribution. As you know, we have said for 2023, we are not planning to break that out. But we will come back to you as we continue to move along our path of profitability for both Dickinson and Martinez. Thank you. Hey John, it's Maryann. Yes, thanks for that. So, as we stated, the $53 million that I called out for you is related to prior periods. It's a good news story. We were successful on a resolution of an item that has prior period benefit, and it will have some, but all bet smaller benefit going forward. And that's about $0.13 in the quarter. As you have stated, typically the biggest mover on our rate is the relationship between our midstream business and our refining business. But from time-to-time, we could also have discrete items. Those items could be positive or negative. And in some cases, they are positive. But as you stated, the typical driver there, when you look at our Federal rate and the State tax rate would be that relationship. One of the things that you have said when you look at that rate, it's a little bit lower than average. I think you are probably coming to around a 20% ZIP code in the quarter. As you have seen from last year, we have run about 22%. So, there is a range there, but certainly, 20% is at the lower end of that when you look at the relationships between refining and midstream today. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ryan. It's Maryann. Let me try to give you a little bit of color. When you look at Q1 to Q2 performance, keep in mind in the U.S. Gulf Coast, as you stated, we were under turnaround in the first quarter and obviously ramping up. So, you saw the benefits of that, obviously, in the second quarter despite the fact that we did have the reformer down for just a portion of the month. As I was commenting on, it's only about a 1% impact for the second quarter that will get a little bit larger, as I shared, given the fact that we are assuming it to be down. I think the other thing to keep in mind is typically when we look at cost in the quarter, when we are doing heavy turnarounds, as we did in the first quarter, we are typically doing other maintenance work and that was much lighter in the second quarter as well. As it relates to STAR, as you know, we were ramping up our comments as we have been sharing STAR was ramping up through the second quarter. So, minimal impact with respect to STAR, but you will begin to see that now as we have reached the completion of that project."

            "name": "Mike Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Beginning with our views on the macro environment, refining margins continued strong in the second quarter. Despite crack spreads incentivizing high refining utilization, product inventory levels remain low. Global capacity additions continue to progress slower than anticipated and we believe that global demand growth will remain strong. In the second half of the year, the refining outlook remains healthy. We expect year-over-year U.S. late product demand to grow consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year supported by lower energy prices and recovering air travel. This demand strength post tight inventories and receding economic headwinds are expected to continue to support elevated margins. And as we completed nearly four quarters of elevated turnaround activity early in the second quarter, we are expecting an increase in industry planned maintenance work by our peers in almost every region in which we operate. Overall, we believe an enhanced mid-cycle environment will continue in the U.S. due to relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Now turning to our results. In the second quarter, we delivered strong results across our business. In Refining & Marketing, strong margins, cost discipline and sound commercial performance led to segment adjusted EBITDA of nearly $3.2 billion. Our Midstream segment delivered durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated segment adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which is up 5% year-over-year. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC's portfolio as it anticipates growing its cash flows and increasing distributions to unitholders. MPLX's distribution MPC was $502 million this quarter, an annualized rate of over $2 billion, which fully covers MPC's current dividend and half of our planned 2023 capital program, not including MPLX. During the second quarter, we have progressed key projects such as completing the STAR project at the Galveston Bay refinery. The competitive position of our Galveston Bay refinery is enhanced by the increased residual fuel and heavy crude processing as well as distillate recovery. We are well positioned with two premier 600,000 barrel per day refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast with significant logistics and export capacity to support our global commercial strategy. At the Martinez Renewable Fuels facility, construction activities are progressing. Pre-treatment capabilities are starting to come online in the second half of 2023 and the facility is expected to be capable of producing its full capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. At that point, Martinez will be among the largest, most competitive renewable diesel facilities with a competitive operating profile, robust logistics flexibility and advantaged feedstock slate and a strategic relationship with Neste. On capital allocation, in the second quarter, we returned nearly $3.4 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. And from May 2021 through the end of July, we have repurchased 264 million shares or approximately 40% of the shares outstanding. Moving to our sustainability efforts. In July, we published our 12th annual sustainability report and our 7th annual perspectives on climate scenarios report. Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios which aligns with TCFD standards, provides insights into how we see the energy landscape, our thoughts on climate-related risks and opportunities the resources we put towards addressing them and the results that we have achieved. Our sustainability report shows continued progress on goals that we have set for ourselves, our efforts to strengthen the resiliency of our operations and to innovate for the future. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann. Thanks, Maryann. In summary, we will continue to invest capital to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets and where we believe there are attractive returns. Year-to-date, we've invested over $1.2 billion. Our focus on operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment. MPLX remains a source of growth in our portfolio, distributing over $2 billion to MPC annually. And as MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe we'll continue to have capacity to increase its cash contributions to MPC. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash flow generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Yes, good morning, Doug. Thanks for the question. I am going to let Rick give a little more detail, but I'll start off with a couple of comments. One, we have made structural changes and have changed our commercial process quite a bit. With that said, I know yourself and a lot of the analysts like to look at that capture metric. I just want to always caution people that the metrics that I care more about is cash flow generation and earnings profitability. So I look at that much more than that capture metric, because I think there is pros and cons to it. But to your point, obviously, it has trended up and driven by a lot of the things that we have changed over the last couple of years. So I'll let Rick give a little more detail. Let me just add a couple of comments to it. As I just said to your first question, the number one concentration is to generate cash. And then I am a believer that this business has both return on and return of capital as its requirements. So on the return on, we are investing capital to improve our earnings and grow our cash flows over time, but we are also committed to return of. So we used the word strict capital discipline. We set our programs such that we are going to be able to participate in both sides of that, because I am a big believer in both. We got to show the market that we can invest capital wisely to grow our earnings, and we also want to show the market that we're returning capital to the owners. So that's a program that we've been on for a while here a couple of years. We're going to continue in that mode. And I just want to give you a little bit more flavor as to how we look at it, but it all starts with generating cash and then optimizing return on and return of. You are welcome. Manav, this is Mike. I just want to add. It's just a little early in the year. We obviously have some insight as to what we're planning to do in \u201824, but we will talk about that in subsequent quarters as opposed to now. Manav, it's Mike. I just want to add that when we look at the project, we try and challenge ourselves as Brian said, without the advantaged feedstock to make sure we're comfortable that we have a good project even in that conservative nature. And then obviously, the commercial teams are going to work very hard to optimize the feedstocks whether it's to our other refineries or to the RD facilities. But we try and start out before we deploy that capital in such a way that we feel comfortable that we'll have upside as we do better commercially on the feedstock side. You are welcome. Paul, it's Mike. I'll start on the first one, I'll let Rick take the second one. Similar to Manuv's question is \u2013 we'll give a little more color on 2024 capital in the next couple of quarters. We do have some projects that we think will continue to optimize our portfolio and improve upon it. But like I said a few minutes ago, it's a little early to talk about that capital at this point. So if you can just hold your thought, we'll give a little bit more on the next quarter and start to give you a little bit more insight as to what we're thinking in \u201824. Yes, Jason, it's Mike. I'll start, and then I'll let Rick jump in. What I was saying in the prepared remarks is we as a company have gone through four quarters of pretty heavy turnaround. And so we're later into the rest of the year, compared to what we see as the industry, and we'll have to see how it plays out, but it looks like the industry has a lot more activity into the rest of the year. So that's what I was trying to say as far as the difference between where we are and where we think the rest of the industry is. And Roger, it's Mike. To your question, financially, you got to be thinking into \u201824. As Tim said, we are ramping, we are starting up. We are going to bring on the additional units and if all goes well, we will be on by the end of the year. So, you will start to see the financial performance more in \u201824 on a go-forward basis. And Roger, it's Mike. The other thing and I know you know this already, but obviously, the refining assets cash flows are significantly higher than what's happening in renewable diesel. I think the way you should think about that is, us looking at all our assets, and we talk about portfolio optimization to take two assets that we did not think would be competitive long-term and deserving of investing capital and it put them in a positive cash flow mode going forward, obviously, in a diesel mode as opposed to a crude mode. So, I think it's more of a portfolio optimization realization compared to where we are on refining cash flows. Okay. I appreciate that feedback. Thank you. Yes, Ryan, it's Mike. I like the word energy evolution more than energy transition. I know a lot of people use energy transition, but I think it's going to evolve over a longer period of time than most have written about. So we're trying to be very thoughtful. We will using the word evolve. We will evolve the company over time. As you pointed out, 2 of our facilities now are renewable diesel. We made a small investment in an RNG facility. So Dave and his team are looking at all those opportunities. We talked on the call today about we're active in some of the DOE hydrogen hubs, and we'll see how that plays out over time. So think of us as going to be very thoughtful. We try to use the word strict capital discipline. We do want to invest as opportunities present themselves, but we are committed to getting solid returns. So overall, I'd say you're just going to see us chip away at little activities over time and constantly evolve it to your point about, what are we going to look like in 10 years? And 10 years, 20 years or whatever Marathon has been around for 130 years. We plan to be around for 130 more. So we'll evolve the company as the market dictates. And obviously, consumer preferences, regulatory impacts, all those things are going to drive what happens and we'll be very attentive to it and we'll look to deploy capital as we see the opportunities."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. . We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan : Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Let me first share our view on the macro environment. In the first quarter, volatility in the global energy market remained high, driven by uncertainties around the potential for recession, the pace of China's economic recovery and the impact of sanctions on Russian products. At the same time, supply remains tight, supported by nearly 4 million barrels per day of global refining capacity that has come offline in the last couple of years. Global demand continues to grow as the need for affordable, reliable energy increases throughout the world. IEA is projecting 2 million barrels a day increase in 2023. Since last quarter, distillate cracks have come down, gasoline cracks have improved as expected given the onset of the summer driving season. So overall, we believe supply constraints and growing demand will support strong refining margins throughout 2023. Cracks have decreased from 2022 levels but still above historic mid-cycle levels. In alignment with what we said last quarter, we remain bullish into the driving season, and gasoline strength is expected to improve the diesel situation, while jet demand continues to improve. As we continue through the year, much will depend on the ongoing recovery in China and the extent, if any, of recessionary impacts. We continue building out our global presence, supported by our offices in Houston, London and Singapore as we invest in our global commercial strategy. And our cost advantaged refining system is well positioned to supply growing markets. This quarter, despite significant planned turnaround work at several key facilities, in particular, in our Gulf Coast region at Galveston Bay and Garyville, we delivered the strongest first quarter results in the company's history. Planned maintenance activities reduced refinery throughput by 11 million barrels compared with the fourth quarter. Our team's operational and commercial execution supported our ability to generate Refining & Marketing segment adjusted EBITDA of nearly $4 billion or $15.09 per barrel. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC's portfolio as it continues to grow its cash flows and capital returns. Our Midstream segment delivers durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which is up 9% year-over-year. MPLX distributions to MPC was roughly $500 million this quarter and an annualized rate of over $2 billion, which fully covers MPC's dividend as well as half of our planned 2023 capital program. During the first quarter, we advanced value-creating projects. At Galveston Bay, we completed the STAR project. Rather than expand the GBR cokers, we elected to upgrade the resid hydrocracker unit as it offers better conversion and increased liquid volume yield. Fractionation modifications offer increased diesel recovery and the refinery will be able to process significantly more discounted heavy crude. Overall, STAR is expected to add 40,000 barrels per day of incremental crude capacity and 17,000 barrels a day of resid processing capacity. Start-up activities are progressing and we expect STAR to ramp through the second quarter of 2023. The incremental profitability from this project will primarily be determined by the spread between heavy crude and untreated diesel over the incremental 40,000 barrels a day of crude capacity. At the Martinez renewable fuels facility, we reached full Phase I production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels, ramping to design rates and yields as planned. Phase II construction activities are on schedule. Pretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of 2023, which will enable the facility to ramp to its full expected capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. Martinez will be among the largest renewable diesel facilities in the world, underpinned by a competitive operating and capital cost profile, robust inbound and outbound logistics flexibility and advantaged feedstock slate and our strategic relationship with Neste. In the first quarter, we returned over $3.5 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. And today, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization reinforcing our commitment to strong capital returns. Let me share some of the progress on our low-carbon initiatives. The Martinez indicative facilities are competitively advantaged. They're supported by upstream value-creation integration with our Beatrice and Cincinnati pretreatment plants and downstream integration with our vast marketing footprint. The strategic partnerships we're cultivating with Neste, ADM and the Andersons creates platforms for additional collaboration within renewables. This quarter, we had an investment in an emerging producer of dairy farm-based renewable natural gas, providing the ability to participate in early-stage development at an attractive entry point. Our Virent subsidiary is progressing a commercially feasible assessment for converting bio-based feedstocks in the gasoline and sustainable aviation fuel. We believe for these projects and opportunities we are taking steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture and supply to a growing market. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen : Thanks, Mike. Moving to first quarter results. Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $6.09. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.2 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was nearly $4.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $337 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased nearly $3.2 billion of our shares.  Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2022 to first quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $600 million. This decrease was driven by Refining & Marketing as refining margins per barrel were down quarter-over-quarter. As we indicated last quarter, throughputs were lower primarily due to the significant planned turnaround activity. Corporate expenses were roughly in line with our guidance. And despite general inflationary pressures, we have maintained cost discipline since taking $100 million out of corporate costs since 2020. The tax rate for the first quarter was 21%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $800 million. Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Like many in the industry, several of our refineries were impacted by winter storm Elliot at the end of December. These impacts carried into the first quarter, reducing our crude throughput by 3 million barrels. Winter Storm Elliott and higher planned maintenance in the Gulf Coast region reduced overall refining utilization, which was down 5% to 89%. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower in all regions compared with the fourth quarter. Capture was 98%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team, particularly given the extensive turnaround activity this quarter. Refining operating costs per barrel were roughly flat sequentially in the first quarter at $5.68. Lower throughput compared to the fourth quarter impacted operating cost per barrel. This was partially offset by lower energy costs, primarily in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions, although we experienced higher natural gas prices in the West Coast. We expect operating cost per barrel to be lower in the second quarter as reflected in our guidance. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 98%. Our commercial teams executed effectively in a volatile market environment. Light product margin tailwinds were balanced against impacts associated with inventory builds and planned maintenance activity. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. Still, we believe through our commercial efforts, our capture baseline has moved closer to 100%. As our strategic pillar indicates, we have been committed to improving our commercial performance and believe that the capabilities we have built over the last 18 months will provide a sustainable advantage, we have meaningfully changed the way we go to market from a commercial perspective throughout our entire company. We believe these capabilities will provide incremental value beyond what we have realized to date. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream adjusted EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment delivered resilient first quarter results. Adjusted EBITDA was 9% higher year-over-year, reflecting business growth. Our Midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing our capital plan with projects anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins. These disciplined investments in high-return projects, along with our focus on cost flow optimization, are expected to grow our cash flows. This will allow us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders. This quarter, MPLX distributions contributed $502 million in cash flow to MPC. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and is a differentiator for us compared to peers without Midstream businesses. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $4.2 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $98 million headwind for the quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude and product inventory, offsetting benefits from a decrease in refined product receivables related to lower product sales. Capital expenditures and investments totaling $664 million this quarter. We saw consistent spending in refining in the first quarter as were progressed on the Martinez renewable fuel facility conversion and the completion of the Galveston Bay STAR project. MPC returned over $3.5 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an 85% payout of the nearly $4.2 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. We now have $9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization which includes the additional $5 billion approval announced today. At the end of the first quarter, NPC had approximately $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Turning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our second quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 91%. Utilization is forecast to be higher than the first quarter levels due to planned turnaround activity having a lower impact on crude units in the second quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $400 million in the quarter, with activity primarily in the Mid-Con and West Coast regions. We expect turnaround activity to be front-half weighted in 2023. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to spend roughly $760 million on turnaround in 2023 and anticipate the full year turnaround spend to be comparable to the level of spend in 2022. Operating cost per barrel in the second quarter are expected to be lower at $5.20 as we expect to see benefits from higher throughput and lower energy costs. As we look further into 2023, we anticipate our operating cost per barrel would decline and trend towards a more normalized level of $5 per barrel as we complete turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.35 billion for the second quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. To recap, our first quarter results reflect our team's strong operational and commercial execution across the company. Our capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure competitive dividend with the potential for growth. We want to grow the company's earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline beyond these three priorities we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.\nMichael Hennigan : Thanks, Maryann. In summary, our results reflect the strongest first quarter in the company's history, generating $5.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio, distributing just over $500 million to MPC this quarter. And as MPLX grows its free cash flow, we believe we'll have capacity to increase capital returns to MPC. This quarter, we invested $664 million. We will invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. We remain focused on ensuring the competitiveness of our assets as we progress through the energy evolution. Solid execution of our three strategic pillars is foundational. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. We believe the improvements we've made to our cost structure, portfolio and commercial and operational execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, which will enable us to capture opportunities irrespective of the market environment. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice with the ability to generate the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian : Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your question, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. Sheila, we are ready for them.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta : Congrats on a great first quarter. I had a couple of questions here. The first is around the West Coast. We're all watching Singapore margins right now and they continue to trade very weak. And just your perspective of, do you think the weakness in Asia is a reflection of demand? And do you see risk that, that product comes to the West Coast at which point there could be some downward pressure on PADD 5 margins?\nRick Hessling : Neil, it's Rick. Really, I think the way we look at it is -- we're looking at it from a global perspective. So we'll touch on the West Coast here in a moment. But when you think globally, it's a great call out to put Asia and Singapore in a bucket, but I'd also throw Europe into that bucket as well. And if we've learned anything over the last couple of years as trade flows and cracks or the world is more connected than it's ever been. So it's a really good call out in drawing if there is a truly impact to the U.S. refiners. One thing I'd say is as we look at Asia and Europe specifically, we actually see that as support for U.S. cracks. We see it as bullish for MPC. I mean we're hearing rumors of both regions you mentioned, Singapore and Asia and Europe, we're hearing rumors of run cuts there, which we see as bullish for us, especially on the West Coast, as you know, the incremental barrel at times comes from Asia. And if it doesn't come to the West Coast, we see that as positive for margins and cracks. And then lastly, I'd say our breakeven is structurally lower than it's been in the past. And as we view Europe as the marginal player in the world, we have a competitive advantage, as you know, on energy costs, feedstock acquisition, complexity of our refineries, our workforce, our reliability. And then last, but certainly not least, we have an incredible export -- global export program on products. So we're able to clear our markets quite well. So we believe if you -- when you add all of those up, Neil, it really gives us quite the competitive advantage, specifically in the West Coast, but I would say in PADDS 2, 3 and 5 where we operate. And with that, I'll ask Brian if he has any specific comments on products in the West Coast to add.\nBrian Partee : Yes. Thanks, Rick, and Neil. Just a quick data point. Very good question. We are seeing some fundamental shifts in global trade flows as a result of economic activities and product sanctions, et cetera. Rick did mention the marginal barrel coming into the West Coast has traditionally been for many years, an import coming from the Far East. So just on order of magnitude, we're looking at 250,000 barrels a day to balance the system, primarily gas and jet fuel, and we expect that balance to continue to trend in terms of favoring more imports as we go forward as more facilities are converted to RD on the West Coast. Other data point, I think that's relevant in terms of penetrating the West Coast market and from the Far East, is also the tanker rates and availability of the foreign fleet. Current rates out of South Korea into the West Coast are about $8 a barrel. That's about 2x of what historically we've seen in the market. And the other two components that make it a little bit tricky to push incremental barrels into the West Coast or, of course, in California, you meet the spec. And then just logistics constraints in terms of docs and tankage, which are also being further constrained by some of the RD penetration that we're seeing in the West Coast market.\nNeil Mehta : That's great perspective, guys. And then a follow-up for me is just around return of capital. And you guys have done a super job getting the share count down. Is there a consideration here though, given the degree of economic uncertainty that might be out there about downside resilience through strengthening the balance sheet as we've seen in the past, companies have gotten themselves in trouble by buying back stock towards the top of the cycle, and you guys have generally been countercyclical in your buyback approach.\nMaryann Mannen : Neil, thanks for the question. It's Maryann. So look, first of all, as you know, we've got a little over $11.5 billion of cash sitting on the MPC balance sheet. And you've heard from the team, and Mike this morning, our views on the balance of the year. We do take into consideration each time we make our decisions what the share repurchase will look like, and we do that quarterly. We look at the macro conditions. We look at our cash positions. Obviously, having a strong balance sheet is foundational for us to be able to execute our capital allocation program as we just shared with you. But we do take a look at it quarterly. It is not something that we set for a long period of time. We have the ability to evaluate all of those things, as you just outlined for us.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nKalei Akamine: This is actually Kalei on for Doug. My first question is just on the macro and how you're positioned here for the second quarter. So your peers are seeing really solid demand numbers and your opening commentary was quite constructive. Yes, the throughput guidance put out for the second quarter looks a bit conservative. So at a high level, can you share any insights on demand from your own system and maybe elaborate a bit more on your outlook near term?\nBrian Partee : This is Brian. Yes, let me weigh in on that. So first and foremost, as we look across an outlook for demand, we really look comprehensively at our entire book of business from a marketing standpoint. So it's including our wholesale class of trade, our direct dealer our branded jobber, our national accounts. So we really think that, that's more reflective of the market as a whole. And let me give you some color on the quarter. So I'll give you some numbers in terms of what Q1 look like relative to Q1 of 2022. So on the gasoline front, our book of business is just described was up 4.7%. The EIA call on demand on Q1 was about 1.7%. On the West Coast, despite some historically heavy rainfall and flood events, we're actually flat year-on-year, which bodes for some optimism as we trend into the summer in the West Coast. On the distillate side, we are off about 1.2% in the first quarter. EIA call on demand was down about 7%, but we believe that's heavily weighted with some sluggish home heat demand due to the warmer weather temperatures this past winter in the Northeast. On the West Coast, often asked in terms of distillate, we were actually up 1.4% year-on-year again despite those weather events. And on the jet fuel side of the business, we saw a 6% rise in demand in the quarter, which comps to about 5% from the EIA perspective. And we expect to see jet to continue to grow on the trend that it's been on really over the last two years to reach pre-pandemic levels late this year into early 2024. A couple of other really important data points as we look forward on demand, I think it's important to mention that -- if we look at gasoline, last year around this time of the year, we were about $4.20 per gallon at retail. We're currently around $3.61. So about 15% below prior year. We believe that bodes favorably. We're seeing that. As we look at our April sales, as we trend into Q2, we've seen week-on-week growth. So we're seeing that optimism built into the summer driving season. And similarly, on the distillate side, retail is off almost 22% year-on-year. Now as it relates to some of the sluggishness in demand in the first quarter on the distillate side of the book, as we look domestically, certainly, inflation is creating some degree of drag on demand. We're seeing that really pretty consistently across the U.S. on a nominal basis coming off a pretty high clip over the last year or so. But it goes without saying, with the inflationary pressures, you do expect to see some demand curtailments, and we do see that manifesting. But it's not something that is a bright red light for us right now. It's something that we're watching closely. As we trend into the ag season here in the Mid-Con, we're seeing early signs of recovery of demand as we go into the second quarter and have optimism as we roll through the balance of the year. The last thing I would say is as we look forward, and we've seen a shift away from a demand perspective, favoring diesel to gasoline. We do think that, that sets up well for our commercial capabilities as we look to do more inter and intra-regional optimization as we come away from a strong, strong distillate lead over the last 1.5 years or so, to more of a balance between gas and diesel in terms of which one leads the crack.\nKalei Akamine: So I guess, on balance, it sounds quite positive. My second question is for Maryann. The buyback is obviously something that separates you from your peers, and we appreciate the visibility provided by the $5 billion expansion today. But I want to ask about the ordinary dividend. In our view, refining is not contributing to that dividend today as it's more than covered by the distributions from MPLX. So as you close out spending on the STAR project and consider what we think is a reset in the mid-cycle, it looks like the dividend has a lot of capacity to increase here. So how are you thinking about that piece of your value proposition?\nMaryann Mannen : Thanks for the question. So as it relates to the dividend, we continue to be committed to the secure competitive and as we've said, potentially growing dividend. We've committed to evaluate that dividend at least annually, and we intend to do so in a very similar schedule as we did in 2022. It is part of the capital allocation framework, as we've shared, and we will evaluate that in a similar time frame as we did in 2022. \nMichael Hennigan : I just want to add to that. Thanks for noticing that. One of the things that we think is unique in our value proposition is the $2 billion-plus that we're getting from MPLX. And if you listen to the call earlier, MPLX had a very strong quarter. We continue to grow the cash flows at MPLX. We'll have a similar distribution increased discussion later in the year. But I think it's pretty important to understand that $2 billion-plus coming in, as you mentioned and I mentioned in prepared remarks, covers the dividend and a good portion of the capital. So I think it's a pretty important point as to the way we think about all the cash flows within the portfolio. So thanks for pointing that out, and it does come into our thinking as we advance both dividend and repurchase activity.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.\nManav Gupta : See, I quickly just wanted to focus a little bit on Galveston-based STAR project. I think it's not as well understood. And if you could help us understand how to model it little more accurately? I mean, 40,000 barrel day increase we can model more accurately. But how does the 17,000-barrel resid processing capacity, what are the spreads we should watch for that so we can give you full credit for this project because I honestly don't think you're getting too much credit for this project in your numbers?\nMichael Hennigan : Manav, it's Mike. I'll start, and then I'll let Tim add some color. As far as modeling, the way to think about the incremental change at the plant now is we'll be able to run 40,000 barrels a day of more heavy crude with the additional resid processing capability. So the way to model it is 40,000 times the delta between heavy crude and untreated or unfinished distillate that's exactly what STAR is doing, and then we can add in commercial changes to that, et cetera, et cetera. But as far as the modeling, it's that delta for whatever margin you think. And today, I will say, right today, that's running about $15 to give you a point in time, multiply it by the 40,000 and wherever you project margins into the future. Tim, can give a little bit more color on where we stand on the project itself.\nTim Aydt: Yes, Manav, this is Tim. Thanks for the question. I would say that you have to keep in mind is, first off, I think, that we completed this project in phases. So really a good amount of the STAR scope has already been completed and has been put in service previously. So it's already earning a return. I think the remaining STAR project is really around this resid portion of the room. So that is indeed finished up during the mechanical completion during the first quarter turnaround and then we've been in start-up during April. So that's all looking good from that standpoint. I think the other thing that I would say is that we ended up expanding the -- hydrocracker instead of the GBR cokers -- and that's really because of the better conversion and the liquid volume expansion that you get with the addition of the hydrogen. So that can maybe be explained a little bit if you -- if you look at a comparison between a coker and the RHU unit, if you put 100 barrels of liquid into the coker, you get about 80 barrels of liquid out and the rest is coke. That's lower value. If you put that same 100 in the RHU unit, you get 107 barrels of liquids out. So obviously, that 27 barrels is about 34% increase in liquids, which are higher valued. So that's why we made that decision. I would also point out that GBR is unique and this got the only operating resid hydrocracker unit in the U.S. So that's what made that beneficial. And we had a pretty capital-efficient project there to make the modifications to the RHU as opposed to starting with another greenfield coker. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nManav Gupta : That's very helpful. My follow-up quickly here is your first phase of Martinez is already on, looks like a very smooth start compared to some of the other projects which are facing problems. Now obviously, at some point, pretreat comes on and then the second phase. So if you could just walk us through when everything starts up. And then there is one small request is that once everything starts up, you probably are one of the bigger producers of renewable diesel. So at some point, if you could break those earnings out for us, then we can give you more credit for it.\nTim Aydt: Okay. Manav, I'll start with maybe just giving an update on the schedule. So you are correct. The Martinez has reached the full Phase I production of 260 million gallons per year back in -- earlier in the first quarter. Facility did ramp up to the design rates as planned and as scheduled. We're happy to report that the remaining construction activities at Martinez are on schedule. Regarding the pretreatment unit, that's scheduled to come online in the second half of 2023. And then by the end of the year, we're looking to have the full rate of production of renewable diesel at 730 million gallons per year by the end of December. And now I'll turn it to Maryann relative to the second part of your question.\nMaryann Mannen : Thanks for the question, Manav. Yes. We'll continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for a renewable segment. As we've shared before, for 2023, we won't have a renewable segment, but we recognize the question. We recognize the importance of our renewables and commitment to low-carbon strategies, and we'll continue to evaluate that and make a proper determination as these projects come full online as to when we'll do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng : Can I just go back into the Galveston Bay? Can you -- I mean, you talked about wanting more oil. Does it in any shape or form that change your product slate and also that what is the OpEx associated with wondering that additional assets or that expanded asset?\nMichael Hennigan : Yes, Paul, I think you hit it on the head. It just gives us more ability to run heavy crudes. So that's at the front end and the incremental coming out the back end is distillate. The project itself coming out of the resid hydrotreater, it's unfinished distillate, but that's why I was trying to answer Manav's question on how to model it. The easiest way to think about it is heavy crude to unfinished distillate. That's the crack spread of the incremental change.\nPaul Cheng : So we should assume that the entire 40,000 -- because then you have a monometric expansion, so that your throughput is up, say, 43,000 barrels per day. Is it all of them that will be distillate or 70%?\nMichael Hennigan : No, no, it's the 40,000 Manav -- I'm sorry, Paul. I'm saying just like I answered to Manav is, it's 40,000 barrels a day of crude that comes into the plant, heavy crude, what comes out of the plant is untreated distillate.\nPaul Cheng : I see. Okay. So at the end of time, will be untreated distillate. And how about the OpEx associated with that unit? Is that...\nMichael Hennigan : We haven't given that specific -- that particular unit itself specifics.\nPaul Cheng : Okay. The second question is quite simple. Maryann in your presentation, you indicated that first quarter result was being hurt by unfavorable inventories impact. Can you quantify and that -- also that -- say where's that unfavorable inventory impact that you\u2019re showing up? I suppose that you're showing up in the plant but not solution? And also that -- whether those will get reversed in the second quarter?\nMaryann Mannen : Sure, Paul. So in the quarter, as I was trying to share capture in the quarter was 98%. There were a couple of key factors that actually impacted our performance. One of those, as I mentioned, was planned turnarounds. Obviously, that impacted throughput, Galveston Bay. And as you know, we took Galveston Bay -- we took that opportunity to complete STAR as well. And there was also turnaround in the Mid-Con as well. The second driver was inventory impacts. And you may remember from the fourth quarter, we actually had a tailwind. We built some inventory in the quarter. We wouldn't expect necessarily that inventory to impact the second quarter as well, but those things are volatile. And then one of the key benefits in the quarter was actually light product margins. In the second quarter, we gave guidance. But remember, we are very much front-half-weighted from a turnaround perspective. Actually, our guidance for Q2, roughly $400 million is above the first quarter actual turnaround expense. This will be for us four quarters of heavy turnaround somewhat unprecedented. We made what we think were some good decisions in early 2022 to delay turnaround to be sure that we did not have lost opportunity with respect to the heavy driving season and the increased demand. And similarly, when we think about the second quarter, we would expect that the months of May and June would see benefit as we look at the turnaround expense there. So I will pause there and see if maybe Rick and/or Brian want to add any incremental color with respect to the performance in the quarter.\nPaul Cheng : And Maryann, I just want to clarify that. So the first quarter, the statement saying that is a negative inventory -- unfavorable inventory impact, that is the absence of the fourth quarter benefit or that it actually is a negative inventory impact in the first quarter?\nMaryann Mannen : No, Paul, sorry about that. It is actually a negative impact in the first quarter. We actually built inventory in the quarter.\nPaul Cheng : And would you quantify how big is that?\nMaryann Mannen : Paul, we normally don't give that level of detail. It was not, however, the -- of those three elements, it was not the single largest driver.\nPaul Cheng : Okay. And can you tell us which region that majority of the inventory build happened? Or is it just across all regions?\nMaryann Mannen : Yes. We had inventory builds across all regions, Paul. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin : This one is on diesel. It connects to some of your comments earlier about the heating impact and maybe some timing-related factors in the market. But there was an expectation that as jet fuel recovered that it would benefit the diesel market because there was some overblending of jet components into diesel and we ran into sort of tough demand comps around both price and weather. And so maybe that benefit didn't necessarily filter through, but I was wondering, since you're so you guys are pretty indexed heavily to the jet market probably see things that other operators don't. If you think that, that benefit is maybe coming just a little bit on a lag, particularly given some of your comments around demand on the jet side, which seems to be performing as expected\nBrian Partee : Yes, Sam, this is Brian. Yes, very good question, very on point. I think the question here in the paradox is demand looks fairly decent as you look across the distillate barrel, but we've seen this sell off here over the last several weeks. So there lies the question. And our view is it's a little bit overdone. But I think the read-through is not on the macro fundamentals of supply and demand. But the one element that we think overreached into the distillate market and the outlook was the Russian sanctions. So we've all been anticipating the sanctions that went into place earlier this year and the associated impacts were uncertain. And as you know, the market doesn't process uncertainty very well. And I think the market had to be more bearish view, if you will, of those sanctions and the implications in terms of slowing flows into the global market. And what we've seen is those flows have continued, albeit at a pretty significant discount, they have continued. So I think the overreach or the overarching sentiment around distillate and valuation is not on supply and demand, but with a little bit more clarity around the impact or lack of impact, if you will, on the Russian sanctions on the global distillate flows.\nSam Margolin : Okay. Yes, that makes sense. We saw the same thing in crude, I guess. Sorry, go ahead.\nMichael Hennigan : No, I was just going to add, Sam, we still are constructive on jet recovery as well, to your point. It's been slowly moving in the right direction. We think that's going to continue to advance throughout. And if gasoline is as strong as we think it's going to be, I mean, inventories are still pretty low gasoline compared to last year compared to the 5-year average, however, you want to look at it. It's a constructive gasoline market, it's a recovering jet market. And in our view, that bode well for distillate.\nSam Margolin : Okay. And as a follow-up, this is sort of a redo on Neil's question about the balance sheet structure and capital allocation, but I'll put it in a different way. I think a lot of people are aware now that the MPLX distribution more than covers the MPC dividend, but what's interesting now is that your interest income on your cash balance covers like half of the MPC dividend or almost. And it's -- there's a matter of uncertainty in the economic environment, but then there's also sort of what's going on with rates and the optimal capital structure around that. So I'm just wondering if -- maybe there's a change to kind of the mid-cycle cash balance that I think was $1.5 billion that you were targeting?\nMichael Hennigan : Yes. I'm going to start and turn it over to Maryann. Thanks for pointing that out as well, Sam. One of the things, I know all the analysts want to hear, what are we going to do over the next 12 months or so? And what we've been trying to say is it's much more of a dynamic discussion. Obviously, having north of $11 billion on the balance sheet is an important part of what we're doing. And at the end of the day, you said it very well. We're generating a decent amount of earnings off of that compared to where we were just a time ago.  So overall, I think the message that everybody should take away is we're not projecting out 12 months as to what we're going to do there because we think it's a real-time discussion. We are committed. As everybody has seen our DNA, we're committed to returning capital. At the same time, we look at all the parameters that come into play there. The MPLX distribution, the interest that we're getting on that, et cetera, et cetera. So I think you pointed out a couple of things that are important in our discussion and I know it frustrates people that we won't say what we're going to do for the next 12 or 18 months. But I think you've seen us get additional authorization from the Board. So we're committed to returning capital. I think you've seen us be very strict in our discipline on investing capital. We'll continue to do that. And our thought is, over the long term, that gives us the ability to increase value for shareholders.\nMaryann Mannen : I think Mike has covered it well. We talked about ultimately carrying $1 billion. We've had some real life during COVID stress testing of that. We remain committed to our $1 billion. Your comment around interest, I think, is a real fair one. When you look at the -- our total interest and other financial costs. You can see over the last several quarters, the impact of the benefit of interest income on those cash balances as well, Sam. So I hope we've covered your question well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman : I wanted to first ask -- I want to first ask on the light heavy spreads. They've come in quite a bit. It looks like Brent is now below $12. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in the market? Why that tightening is occurring? And if we were setting back to maybe something that's a more typical light-heavy spread versus where we've been the past 6 months or so?\nRick Hessling : Jason, it's Rick. So actually, we believe the market's been overdone, which is often the case in markets. When you look at Q4, one could say it was overdone to the positive for us. Right now, we're looking and saying it's overdone to the negative. And a lot of things are yet to play out. And what I mean by that is when you look at the OPEC+ announced cuts, what will they really cut? History says they announced something and then often do less. So we'll watch that play out throughout the global flows. But in addition to that, I think a dynamic that we've seen change, and we actually view as a positive for us in some instances as barrels are staying closer to home. So what do I mean by that? When you look at Gulf of Mexico production, you look at BP's Mad Dog 2, look at Shell's Vitol platforms that just came online, that's incremental production right in our backyard in the Gulf Coast. We have a really close pulse on Canadian production, and we're seeing upticks in Canadian production. And that's positive for us throughout our entire system. Then you have the Venezuelan barrels that have been in the news lately, the Chevron [Venz] barrels that we and others have taken advantage of. So I think this is yet to fully play out, Jason. I don't think it's as bad as it is today. Where it will go? That's a tough call. We just don't feel it is as depressed of an environment from a sweet-sour spread is what you're seeing today. And then lastly, I'll state, we were a big buyer of SPR barrels. Those barrels will just be coming into our system. That data is public. So when you add up all of the pluses and minuses, we actually feel a little more optimistic today going forward than pessimistic.\nJason Gabelman : Great. I appreciate that outlook. My second question, I wanted to follow up on prepared -- on the prepared remarks you made around the low carbon business. And it seems like you may have aspirations to grow this business well beyond the Martinez renewable diesel plant. You talked about partnerships with a few counterparties, you purchase -- or you bought into the small RNG business. Can you just -- and then I guess the other thing is you have exposure to natural gas sourcing via MPLX. So I was just hoping if you could discuss maybe broadly, how you see this business evolving over the next few years? How big it could get? What the areas of growth you're focused on, particularly in light of the Inflation Reduction Act?\nMichael Hennigan : Yes. So I'll start. We're very enthusiastic that there could be some opportunities, albeit we think it's going to take a considerable amount of time for those to develop. We guided at the last quarter that we would spend about $350 million roughly in our low carbon portfolio. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we have some things going on in a couple of different areas. . I think at the end of the day, that's why I keep using the word evolution rather than transition. It's going to evolve over a long period of time. It's going to be something that we think will be additive to our base business, but it will take a while for it to be meaningfully different than the strong refining and natural gas footprint that we have. But we're trying to be attentive to it. I mean we understand how the pendulum is going to move in that direction. We think the pace will be slower than other people think in general. But at the same time, we do think there's some opportunities for us. As we mentioned, we've made a small investment in renewable natural gas, which -- if that continues to be what we think it could be, we'll continue to put capital to work there. We went in at an early entry point. We thought that was important for us, and then we'll see if we can grow out that business as -- that's just one example. So we're attentive to it. Dave's team has a lot of resource looking for opportunities for us. And as we see them, we'll continue to update you.\nKristina Kazarian: Sheila, I think we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read : Coming back to commentary on the gasoline markets. Just kind of maybe dig in a little deeper where you see the bigger issues, be it gasoline supply itself, whether it's components and then as we think across the 5 PADDs, the stress is not evenly distributed, right? I mean PADD 3 doesn't look all that bad on its own, the PADDS 1, 2 and 5 also kind of different issues. So between the regional things you're looking at, the underlying demand trends and then anywhere else, there's octane components or something else? Can you walk us through where you think the biggest challenges will be for supply?\nBrian Partee : Yes, Roger, this is Brian. So I'll give you a little bit more color on kind of our views. And I think you're fairly rooted in it based on your questions. The way I look at the markets, they're fairly well balanced and in check. So if you look at the -- the only really interesting now is is the New York Harbor market, as you indicated, on gasoline, both whether it's in the West or out of the Gulf Coast. And the New York Harbor has seen quite a bit of strength in the quarter, primarily attributed to really low inventory levels. As mentioned earlier on the distillate side of the book that was more of a drag, it was more of a net positive on the gasoline side of the business in the New York Harbor Northeast markets. There was some turnaround work as well in the pad. The drug things down a little bit in the first quarter. And of course, some of the labor strikes over in Europe caused a little bit of havoc in New York Harbor in the markets and the balance is a bit. One of the kind of related read-throughs, if you will, on the interplay between Europe and the New York Harbor, I think, is relevant. As we've looked through the transition over the last couple of years, the New York Harbor has been long-time position as really the recipient of the push barrels, gasoline barrels coming out of Europe. And as refining balances have changed, a little bit more of a change in terms of consumer preference in Europe towards gasoline and away from distillate on the back end of diesel gate and some of the outflow of that several years ago in Europe have now created more of a pull environment into the New York Harbor. So that dynamic has changed and progressive over the last year. And yes, you're right to say that it's one of the more interesting markets in the U.S. And I'm confident that the market will work to close that gap. We're active in that market. We continue to see opportunity to push further into that market. Beyond that, octane, just for a moment, we had a huge pullout last summer in octane as $5 a barrel. We had a really strong start in the first quarter on octane values, but we do see that plateauing. More naphtha coming into the stream for blending in gasoline. And actually, as we switch from a diesel optimization throughout the system, it's more of a gasoline focus that will help the balances. And even some of the favorability of the light crudes in the Gulf Coast have a better yield on the gasoline/octane side of the book. So the forward view on octane is still favorable, but not -- we don't see quite the environment that we enjoyed last year as we progressed through the summer months.\nMichael Hennigan : And Roger, it's Mike. Brian gave a lot of specifics. I'll just give you my simplistic view is gasoline inventories, like you said, are spread around in the different regions, but there's still 10 million barrels below last year, 17 million barrels below the 5-year average. The demand numbers are strong relative to last year, if you look over a longer period of time. So at least in our view, we think it's a very constructive time for gasoline at this time of the year as we're heading into which is more of the higher demand time as we head into the summer. So we're more constructive, I'll say, than maybe some people out there. And as I mentioned earlier, I know there's some concern around distillate, but we think Jet is going to continue to recover as well. And for the first time in whatever it is, 18 months, gasoline is now over distillate. That's a change in the environment going into this summer that wasn't there last summer. So we still think it's a very constructive environment for us, and we'll see how it plays out.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall : So I just had a follow-up on capture rates. Just any thoughts on the moving pieces directionally in 2Q from the 98% in 1Q? It's another heavy maintenance quarter, but you have the non-recurrence presumably of inventory impact. So should we center around maybe the 100% level as a starting point, maybe a little lower due to maintenance or any other moving pieces we should think about?\nMaryann Mannen : John, thanks for the question. It's Maryann. I'll give you a few high-level comments, and then I'm going to pass to Brian and Rick to give you a little more detail on the quarter. You're right, actually, as we talked about turnaround is slightly higher in the second quarter, but we will be touching less of the crude units just as an example. . And so while there is some planned maintenance, the impact of that should be less in the second quarter. Commercial performance, as you know, has been something that we have targeted for the last 18 months. We believe a lot of the work that we have done is sustainable and it certainly is a continued focus of the team as we head into the balance of the year. I'm going to pass it to Rick and Brian and let them give you a little more color on their expectations for Q2.\nRick Hessling : John, it's Rick. So I'll just double-click on really the last item Maryann touched on. I can't emphasize enough under Mike's leadership, we've unpacked and changed everything we do commercially from A to Z, from feedstocks through finished products, there isn't anything that hasn't been looked at under the covers and redesigned where it needs to be redesigned. So as we look forward, a lot of people say, are you done? And Brian and I will say, will never be done. And Mike would tell us that on a daily basis rightfully. So with that being said, we do expect to continue to get incremental value by region going forward in every region we operate in. We're continuing on this journey and it's a journey that won't end. And it's quite the change for us corporately as we improve collaboratively from refining all the way through commercial. So if you can't tell, we're quite excited about it. And without giving too much detail, we would encourage you to stay tuned and continue to look at our results. Our boss tells us our results speak for themselves, and that's the mantra we live by and feel good about in this metric as you've seen over the last year or so.\nBrian Partee : Yes, John, this is Brian. Just to maybe wrap it up, I think Maryann and Rick covered it quite well. But I see it very simply on the journey that we've been on and where we're at, really working hard to leverage our scale, our unrivaled business insights in the industry. Moving further down the value chain for enhanced margin capture is also another important attribute that we have momentum behind whether it's our export program and delivered cargoes or a branded business, all the things that we're doing -- or we've done historically, we're just doing better today and with more focus and rigor down the value chain. The last thing I would say is really mindset, and Rick hit on this is really two things: continuous improvement, we are never done, and relentless innovation, always trying to reimagine how to run the business, how to do things differently. And I'll put it in the exclamation point, we've been pretty opaque around specifics, but keep watching the results. Rick is proud of the work that the team has done, and we've got more to get.\nOperator: And we do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen : Just really quickly, Brian, on your demand commentary. Clearly, you categorically beaten all the industry data in the first quarter. And as we are a month and change into the second quarter, I am curious to hear a little bit more on the diesel side. So you're seeing some early indications of incremental demand from an ag perspective, what about trucking just because we've seen some of the easing in the tonnage data?\nBrian Partee : Yes, Theresa, sure. So on the distillate side, yes, we do see ag picking up. Of course, that's a year-on-year comp. So it's hard to get a complete read, but we expect it to be a strong season. We do see, again, as I mentioned earlier, some softness on the transportation side of the business, largely driven through consumption and the curtailment of consumption. So whether it be activity at the ports over the road, fairly consistently with our big customers, we've heard that theme. The positive standout though, I would mention is in the mining business, and we do have a pretty big exposure on the mining side of the industry. And we do see robust activity on the mining side of our business throughout really all regions. But it's really that consumer consumption component that we're watching very closely. As we transition here seasonally, I think it's early. As I stated earlier, to call favorably or unfavorably, which direction things are going to break, but it is something that we're keeping a close eye on.\nKristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you so much, everyone, for joining our call today. If you have additional questions or like clarifications on topics discussed this morning, please feel free to reach out to any members of the Investor Relations team, and we're here to help today. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tim Aydt",
            "content": "Yes, Manav, this is Tim. Thanks for the question. I would say that you have to keep in mind is, first off, I think, that we completed this project in phases. So really a good amount of the STAR scope has already been completed and has been put in service previously. So it's already earning a return. I think the remaining STAR project is really around this resid portion of the room. So that is indeed finished up during the mechanical completion during the first quarter turnaround and then we've been in start-up during April. So that's all looking good from that standpoint. I think the other thing that I would say is that we ended up expanding the -- hydrocracker instead of the GBR cokers -- and that's really because of the better conversion and the liquid volume expansion that you get with the addition of the hydrogen. So that can maybe be explained a little bit if you -- if you look at a comparison between a coker and the RHU unit, if you put 100 barrels of liquid into the coker, you get about 80 barrels of liquid out and the rest is coke. That's lower value. If you put that same 100 in the RHU unit, you get 107 barrels of liquids out. So obviously, that 27 barrels is about 34% increase in liquids, which are higher valued. So that's why we made that decision. I would also point out that GBR is unique and this got the only operating resid hydrocracker unit in the U.S. So that's what made that beneficial. And we had a pretty capital-efficient project there to make the modifications to the RHU as opposed to starting with another greenfield coker. So hopefully, that's helpful. Okay. Manav, I'll start with maybe just giving an update on the schedule. So you are correct. The Martinez has reached the full Phase I production of 260 million gallons per year back in -- earlier in the first quarter. Facility did ramp up to the design rates as planned and as scheduled. We're happy to report that the remaining construction activities at Martinez are on schedule. Regarding the pretreatment unit, that's scheduled to come online in the second half of 2023. And then by the end of the year, we're looking to have the full rate of production of renewable diesel at 730 million gallons per year by the end of December. And now I'll turn it to Maryann relative to the second part of your question."

            "name": "Brian Partee",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Rick, and Neil. Just a quick data point. Very good question. We are seeing some fundamental shifts in global trade flows as a result of economic activities and product sanctions, et cetera. Rick did mention the marginal barrel coming into the West Coast has traditionally been for many years, an import coming from the Far East. So just on order of magnitude, we're looking at 250,000 barrels a day to balance the system, primarily gas and jet fuel, and we expect that balance to continue to trend in terms of favoring more imports as we go forward as more facilities are converted to RD on the West Coast. Other data point, I think that's relevant in terms of penetrating the West Coast market and from the Far East, is also the tanker rates and availability of the foreign fleet. Current rates out of South Korea into the West Coast are about $8 a barrel. That's about 2x of what historically we've seen in the market. And the other two components that make it a little bit tricky to push incremental barrels into the West Coast or, of course, in California, you meet the spec. And then just logistics constraints in terms of docs and tankage, which are also being further constrained by some of the RD penetration that we're seeing in the West Coast market. This is Brian. Yes, let me weigh in on that. So first and foremost, as we look across an outlook for demand, we really look comprehensively at our entire book of business from a marketing standpoint. So it's including our wholesale class of trade, our direct dealer our branded jobber, our national accounts. So we really think that, that's more reflective of the market as a whole. And let me give you some color on the quarter. So I'll give you some numbers in terms of what Q1 look like relative to Q1 of 2022. So on the gasoline front, our book of business is just described was up 4.7%. The EIA call on demand on Q1 was about 1.7%. On the West Coast, despite some historically heavy rainfall and flood events, we're actually flat year-on-year, which bodes for some optimism as we trend into the summer in the West Coast. On the distillate side, we are off about 1.2% in the first quarter. EIA call on demand was down about 7%, but we believe that's heavily weighted with some sluggish home heat demand due to the warmer weather temperatures this past winter in the Northeast. On the West Coast, often asked in terms of distillate, we were actually up 1.4% year-on-year again despite those weather events. And on the jet fuel side of the business, we saw a 6% rise in demand in the quarter, which comps to about 5% from the EIA perspective. And we expect to see jet to continue to grow on the trend that it's been on really over the last two years to reach pre-pandemic levels late this year into early 2024. A couple of other really important data points as we look forward on demand, I think it's important to mention that -- if we look at gasoline, last year around this time of the year, we were about $4.20 per gallon at retail. We're currently around $3.61. So about 15% below prior year. We believe that bodes favorably. We're seeing that. As we look at our April sales, as we trend into Q2, we've seen week-on-week growth. So we're seeing that optimism built into the summer driving season. And similarly, on the distillate side, retail is off almost 22% year-on-year. Now as it relates to some of the sluggishness in demand in the first quarter on the distillate side of the book, as we look domestically, certainly, inflation is creating some degree of drag on demand. We're seeing that really pretty consistently across the U.S. on a nominal basis coming off a pretty high clip over the last year or so. But it goes without saying, with the inflationary pressures, you do expect to see some demand curtailments, and we do see that manifesting. But it's not something that is a bright red light for us right now. It's something that we're watching closely. As we trend into the ag season here in the Mid-Con, we're seeing early signs of recovery of demand as we go into the second quarter and have optimism as we roll through the balance of the year. The last thing I would say is as we look forward, and we've seen a shift away from a demand perspective, favoring diesel to gasoline. We do think that, that sets up well for our commercial capabilities as we look to do more inter and intra-regional optimization as we come away from a strong, strong distillate lead over the last 1.5 years or so, to more of a balance between gas and diesel in terms of which one leads the crack. Yes, Sam, this is Brian. Yes, very good question, very on point. I think the question here in the paradox is demand looks fairly decent as you look across the distillate barrel, but we've seen this sell off here over the last several weeks. So there lies the question. And our view is it's a little bit overdone. But I think the read-through is not on the macro fundamentals of supply and demand. But the one element that we think overreached into the distillate market and the outlook was the Russian sanctions. So we've all been anticipating the sanctions that went into place earlier this year and the associated impacts were uncertain. And as you know, the market doesn't process uncertainty very well. And I think the market had to be more bearish view, if you will, of those sanctions and the implications in terms of slowing flows into the global market. And what we've seen is those flows have continued, albeit at a pretty significant discount, they have continued. So I think the overreach or the overarching sentiment around distillate and valuation is not on supply and demand, but with a little bit more clarity around the impact or lack of impact, if you will, on the Russian sanctions on the global distillate flows. Yes, Roger, this is Brian. So I'll give you a little bit more color on kind of our views. And I think you're fairly rooted in it based on your questions. The way I look at the markets, they're fairly well balanced and in check. So if you look at the -- the only really interesting now is is the New York Harbor market, as you indicated, on gasoline, both whether it's in the West or out of the Gulf Coast. And the New York Harbor has seen quite a bit of strength in the quarter, primarily attributed to really low inventory levels. As mentioned earlier on the distillate side of the book that was more of a drag, it was more of a net positive on the gasoline side of the business in the New York Harbor Northeast markets. There was some turnaround work as well in the pad. The drug things down a little bit in the first quarter. And of course, some of the labor strikes over in Europe caused a little bit of havoc in New York Harbor in the markets and the balance is a bit. One of the kind of related read-throughs, if you will, on the interplay between Europe and the New York Harbor, I think, is relevant. As we've looked through the transition over the last couple of years, the New York Harbor has been long-time position as really the recipient of the push barrels, gasoline barrels coming out of Europe. And as refining balances have changed, a little bit more of a change in terms of consumer preference in Europe towards gasoline and away from distillate on the back end of diesel gate and some of the outflow of that several years ago in Europe have now created more of a pull environment into the New York Harbor. So that dynamic has changed and progressive over the last year. And yes, you're right to say that it's one of the more interesting markets in the U.S. And I'm confident that the market will work to close that gap. We're active in that market. We continue to see opportunity to push further into that market. Beyond that, octane, just for a moment, we had a huge pullout last summer in octane as $5 a barrel. We had a really strong start in the first quarter on octane values, but we do see that plateauing. More naphtha coming into the stream for blending in gasoline. And actually, as we switch from a diesel optimization throughout the system, it's more of a gasoline focus that will help the balances. And even some of the favorability of the light crudes in the Gulf Coast have a better yield on the gasoline/octane side of the book. So the forward view on octane is still favorable, but not -- we don't see quite the environment that we enjoyed last year as we progressed through the summer months. Yes, John, this is Brian. Just to maybe wrap it up, I think Maryann and Rick covered it quite well. But I see it very simply on the journey that we've been on and where we're at, really working hard to leverage our scale, our unrivaled business insights in the industry. Moving further down the value chain for enhanced margin capture is also another important attribute that we have momentum behind whether it's our export program and delivered cargoes or a branded business, all the things that we're doing -- or we've done historically, we're just doing better today and with more focus and rigor down the value chain. The last thing I would say is really mindset, and Rick hit on this is really two things: continuous improvement, we are never done, and relentless innovation, always trying to reimagine how to run the business, how to do things differently. And I'll put it in the exclamation point, we've been pretty opaque around specifics, but keep watching the results. Rick is proud of the work that the team has done, and we've got more to get. Yes, Theresa, sure. So on the distillate side, yes, we do see ag picking up. Of course, that's a year-on-year comp. So it's hard to get a complete read, but we expect it to be a strong season. We do see, again, as I mentioned earlier, some softness on the transportation side of the business, largely driven through consumption and the curtailment of consumption. So whether it be activity at the ports over the road, fairly consistently with our big customers, we've heard that theme. The positive standout though, I would mention is in the mining business, and we do have a pretty big exposure on the mining side of the industry. And we do see robust activity on the mining side of our business throughout really all regions. But it's really that consumer consumption component that we're watching very closely. As we transition here seasonally, I think it's early. As I stated earlier, to call favorably or unfavorably, which direction things are going to break, but it is something that we're keeping a close eye on."

            "name": "Michael Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Let me first share our view on the macro environment. In the first quarter, volatility in the global energy market remained high, driven by uncertainties around the potential for recession, the pace of China's economic recovery and the impact of sanctions on Russian products. At the same time, supply remains tight, supported by nearly 4 million barrels per day of global refining capacity that has come offline in the last couple of years. Global demand continues to grow as the need for affordable, reliable energy increases throughout the world. IEA is projecting 2 million barrels a day increase in 2023. Since last quarter, distillate cracks have come down, gasoline cracks have improved as expected given the onset of the summer driving season. So overall, we believe supply constraints and growing demand will support strong refining margins throughout 2023. Cracks have decreased from 2022 levels but still above historic mid-cycle levels. In alignment with what we said last quarter, we remain bullish into the driving season, and gasoline strength is expected to improve the diesel situation, while jet demand continues to improve. As we continue through the year, much will depend on the ongoing recovery in China and the extent, if any, of recessionary impacts. We continue building out our global presence, supported by our offices in Houston, London and Singapore as we invest in our global commercial strategy. And our cost advantaged refining system is well positioned to supply growing markets. This quarter, despite significant planned turnaround work at several key facilities, in particular, in our Gulf Coast region at Galveston Bay and Garyville, we delivered the strongest first quarter results in the company's history. Planned maintenance activities reduced refinery throughput by 11 million barrels compared with the fourth quarter. Our team's operational and commercial execution supported our ability to generate Refining & Marketing segment adjusted EBITDA of nearly $4 billion or $15.09 per barrel. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC's portfolio as it continues to grow its cash flows and capital returns. Our Midstream segment delivers durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which is up 9% year-over-year. MPLX distributions to MPC was roughly $500 million this quarter and an annualized rate of over $2 billion, which fully covers MPC's dividend as well as half of our planned 2023 capital program. During the first quarter, we advanced value-creating projects. At Galveston Bay, we completed the STAR project. Rather than expand the GBR cokers, we elected to upgrade the resid hydrocracker unit as it offers better conversion and increased liquid volume yield. Fractionation modifications offer increased diesel recovery and the refinery will be able to process significantly more discounted heavy crude. Overall, STAR is expected to add 40,000 barrels per day of incremental crude capacity and 17,000 barrels a day of resid processing capacity. Start-up activities are progressing and we expect STAR to ramp through the second quarter of 2023. The incremental profitability from this project will primarily be determined by the spread between heavy crude and untreated diesel over the incremental 40,000 barrels a day of crude capacity. At the Martinez renewable fuels facility, we reached full Phase I production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels, ramping to design rates and yields as planned. Phase II construction activities are on schedule. Pretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of 2023, which will enable the facility to ramp to its full expected capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. Martinez will be among the largest renewable diesel facilities in the world, underpinned by a competitive operating and capital cost profile, robust inbound and outbound logistics flexibility and advantaged feedstock slate and our strategic relationship with Neste. In the first quarter, we returned over $3.5 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. And today, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization reinforcing our commitment to strong capital returns. Let me share some of the progress on our low-carbon initiatives. The Martinez indicative facilities are competitively advantaged. They're supported by upstream value-creation integration with our Beatrice and Cincinnati pretreatment plants and downstream integration with our vast marketing footprint. The strategic partnerships we're cultivating with Neste, ADM and the Andersons creates platforms for additional collaboration within renewables. This quarter, we had an investment in an emerging producer of dairy farm-based renewable natural gas, providing the ability to participate in early-stage development at an attractive entry point. Our Virent subsidiary is progressing a commercially feasible assessment for converting bio-based feedstocks in the gasoline and sustainable aviation fuel. We believe for these projects and opportunities we are taking steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture and supply to a growing market. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann. Thanks, Maryann. In summary, our results reflect the strongest first quarter in the company's history, generating $5.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio, distributing just over $500 million to MPC this quarter. And as MPLX grows its free cash flow, we believe we'll have capacity to increase capital returns to MPC. This quarter, we invested $664 million. We will invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. We remain focused on ensuring the competitiveness of our assets as we progress through the energy evolution. Solid execution of our three strategic pillars is foundational. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. We believe the improvements we've made to our cost structure, portfolio and commercial and operational execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, which will enable us to capture opportunities irrespective of the market environment. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice with the ability to generate the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital. Let me turn the call back to Kristina. I just want to add to that. Thanks for noticing that. One of the things that we think is unique in our value proposition is the $2 billion-plus that we're getting from MPLX. And if you listen to the call earlier, MPLX had a very strong quarter. We continue to grow the cash flows at MPLX. We'll have a similar distribution increased discussion later in the year. But I think it's pretty important to understand that $2 billion-plus coming in, as you mentioned and I mentioned in prepared remarks, covers the dividend and a good portion of the capital. So I think it's a pretty important point as to the way we think about all the cash flows within the portfolio. So thanks for pointing that out, and it does come into our thinking as we advance both dividend and repurchase activity. Manav, it's Mike. I'll start, and then I'll let Tim add some color. As far as modeling, the way to think about the incremental change at the plant now is we'll be able to run 40,000 barrels a day of more heavy crude with the additional resid processing capability. So the way to model it is 40,000 times the delta between heavy crude and untreated or unfinished distillate that's exactly what STAR is doing, and then we can add in commercial changes to that, et cetera, et cetera. But as far as the modeling, it's that delta for whatever margin you think. And today, I will say, right today, that's running about $15 to give you a point in time, multiply it by the 40,000 and wherever you project margins into the future. Tim, can give a little bit more color on where we stand on the project itself. Yes, Paul, I think you hit it on the head. It just gives us more ability to run heavy crudes. So that's at the front end and the incremental coming out the back end is distillate. The project itself coming out of the resid hydrotreater, it's unfinished distillate, but that's why I was trying to answer Manav's question on how to model it. The easiest way to think about it is heavy crude to unfinished distillate. That's the crack spread of the incremental change. No, no, it's the 40,000 Manav -- I'm sorry, Paul. I'm saying just like I answered to Manav is, it's 40,000 barrels a day of crude that comes into the plant, heavy crude, what comes out of the plant is untreated distillate. We haven't given that specific -- that particular unit itself specifics. No, I was just going to add, Sam, we still are constructive on jet recovery as well, to your point. It's been slowly moving in the right direction. We think that's going to continue to advance throughout. And if gasoline is as strong as we think it's going to be, I mean, inventories are still pretty low gasoline compared to last year compared to the 5-year average, however, you want to look at it. It's a constructive gasoline market, it's a recovering jet market. And in our view, that bode well for distillate. Yes. I'm going to start and turn it over to Maryann. Thanks for pointing that out as well, Sam. One of the things, I know all the analysts want to hear, what are we going to do over the next 12 months or so? And what we've been trying to say is it's much more of a dynamic discussion. Obviously, having north of $11 billion on the balance sheet is an important part of what we're doing. And at the end of the day, you said it very well. We're generating a decent amount of earnings off of that compared to where we were just a time ago.  So overall, I think the message that everybody should take away is we're not projecting out 12 months as to what we're going to do there because we think it's a real-time discussion. We are committed. As everybody has seen our DNA, we're committed to returning capital. At the same time, we look at all the parameters that come into play there. The MPLX distribution, the interest that we're getting on that, et cetera, et cetera. So I think you pointed out a couple of things that are important in our discussion and I know it frustrates people that we won't say what we're going to do for the next 12 or 18 months. But I think you've seen us get additional authorization from the Board. So we're committed to returning capital. I think you've seen us be very strict in our discipline on investing capital. We'll continue to do that. And our thought is, over the long term, that gives us the ability to increase value for shareholders. Yes. So I'll start. We're very enthusiastic that there could be some opportunities, albeit we think it's going to take a considerable amount of time for those to develop. We guided at the last quarter that we would spend about $350 million roughly in our low carbon portfolio. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we have some things going on in a couple of different areas. . I think at the end of the day, that's why I keep using the word evolution rather than transition. It's going to evolve over a long period of time. It's going to be something that we think will be additive to our base business, but it will take a while for it to be meaningfully different than the strong refining and natural gas footprint that we have. But we're trying to be attentive to it. I mean we understand how the pendulum is going to move in that direction. We think the pace will be slower than other people think in general. But at the same time, we do think there's some opportunities for us. As we mentioned, we've made a small investment in renewable natural gas, which -- if that continues to be what we think it could be, we'll continue to put capital to work there. We went in at an early entry point. We thought that was important for us, and then we'll see if we can grow out that business as -- that's just one example. So we're attentive to it. Dave's team has a lot of resource looking for opportunities for us. And as we see them, we'll continue to update you. And Roger, it's Mike. Brian gave a lot of specifics. I'll just give you my simplistic view is gasoline inventories, like you said, are spread around in the different regions, but there's still 10 million barrels below last year, 17 million barrels below the 5-year average. The demand numbers are strong relative to last year, if you look over a longer period of time. So at least in our view, we think it's a very constructive time for gasoline at this time of the year as we're heading into which is more of the higher demand time as we head into the summer. So we're more constructive, I'll say, than maybe some people out there. And as I mentioned earlier, I know there's some concern around distillate, but we think Jet is going to continue to recover as well. And for the first time in whatever it is, 18 months, gasoline is now over distillate. That's a change in the environment going into this summer that wasn't there last summer. So we still think it's a very constructive environment for us, and we'll see how it plays out."

            "name": "Maryann Mannen",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Moving to first quarter results. Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $6.09. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.2 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was nearly $4.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $337 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased nearly $3.2 billion of our shares.  Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2022 to first quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $600 million. This decrease was driven by Refining & Marketing as refining margins per barrel were down quarter-over-quarter. As we indicated last quarter, throughputs were lower primarily due to the significant planned turnaround activity. Corporate expenses were roughly in line with our guidance. And despite general inflationary pressures, we have maintained cost discipline since taking $100 million out of corporate costs since 2020. The tax rate for the first quarter was 21%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $800 million. Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Like many in the industry, several of our refineries were impacted by winter storm Elliot at the end of December. These impacts carried into the first quarter, reducing our crude throughput by 3 million barrels. Winter Storm Elliott and higher planned maintenance in the Gulf Coast region reduced overall refining utilization, which was down 5% to 89%. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower in all regions compared with the fourth quarter. Capture was 98%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team, particularly given the extensive turnaround activity this quarter. Refining operating costs per barrel were roughly flat sequentially in the first quarter at $5.68. Lower throughput compared to the fourth quarter impacted operating cost per barrel. This was partially offset by lower energy costs, primarily in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions, although we experienced higher natural gas prices in the West Coast. We expect operating cost per barrel to be lower in the second quarter as reflected in our guidance. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 98%. Our commercial teams executed effectively in a volatile market environment. Light product margin tailwinds were balanced against impacts associated with inventory builds and planned maintenance activity. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. Still, we believe through our commercial efforts, our capture baseline has moved closer to 100%. As our strategic pillar indicates, we have been committed to improving our commercial performance and believe that the capabilities we have built over the last 18 months will provide a sustainable advantage, we have meaningfully changed the way we go to market from a commercial perspective throughout our entire company. We believe these capabilities will provide incremental value beyond what we have realized to date. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream adjusted EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment delivered resilient first quarter results. Adjusted EBITDA was 9% higher year-over-year, reflecting business growth. Our Midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing our capital plan with projects anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins. These disciplined investments in high-return projects, along with our focus on cost flow optimization, are expected to grow our cash flows. This will allow us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders. This quarter, MPLX distributions contributed $502 million in cash flow to MPC. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and is a differentiator for us compared to peers without Midstream businesses. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $4.2 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $98 million headwind for the quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude and product inventory, offsetting benefits from a decrease in refined product receivables related to lower product sales. Capital expenditures and investments totaling $664 million this quarter. We saw consistent spending in refining in the first quarter as were progressed on the Martinez renewable fuel facility conversion and the completion of the Galveston Bay STAR project. MPC returned over $3.5 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an 85% payout of the nearly $4.2 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. We now have $9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization which includes the additional $5 billion approval announced today. At the end of the first quarter, NPC had approximately $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Turning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our second quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 91%. Utilization is forecast to be higher than the first quarter levels due to planned turnaround activity having a lower impact on crude units in the second quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $400 million in the quarter, with activity primarily in the Mid-Con and West Coast regions. We expect turnaround activity to be front-half weighted in 2023. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to spend roughly $760 million on turnaround in 2023 and anticipate the full year turnaround spend to be comparable to the level of spend in 2022. Operating cost per barrel in the second quarter are expected to be lower at $5.20 as we expect to see benefits from higher throughput and lower energy costs. As we look further into 2023, we anticipate our operating cost per barrel would decline and trend towards a more normalized level of $5 per barrel as we complete turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.35 billion for the second quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. To recap, our first quarter results reflect our team's strong operational and commercial execution across the company. Our capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure competitive dividend with the potential for growth. We want to grow the company's earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline beyond these three priorities we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. With that, let me pass it back to Mike. Neil, thanks for the question. It's Maryann. So look, first of all, as you know, we've got a little over $11.5 billion of cash sitting on the MPC balance sheet. And you've heard from the team, and Mike this morning, our views on the balance of the year. We do take into consideration each time we make our decisions what the share repurchase will look like, and we do that quarterly. We look at the macro conditions. We look at our cash positions. Obviously, having a strong balance sheet is foundational for us to be able to execute our capital allocation program as we just shared with you. But we do take a look at it quarterly. It is not something that we set for a long period of time. We have the ability to evaluate all of those things, as you just outlined for us. Thanks for the question. So as it relates to the dividend, we continue to be committed to the secure competitive and as we've said, potentially growing dividend. We've committed to evaluate that dividend at least annually, and we intend to do so in a very similar schedule as we did in 2022. It is part of the capital allocation framework, as we've shared, and we will evaluate that in a similar time frame as we did in 2022. Thanks for the question, Manav. Yes. We'll continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for a renewable segment. As we've shared before, for 2023, we won't have a renewable segment, but we recognize the question. We recognize the importance of our renewables and commitment to low-carbon strategies, and we'll continue to evaluate that and make a proper determination as these projects come full online as to when we'll do that. Sure, Paul. So in the quarter, as I was trying to share capture in the quarter was 98%. There were a couple of key factors that actually impacted our performance. One of those, as I mentioned, was planned turnarounds. Obviously, that impacted throughput, Galveston Bay. And as you know, we took Galveston Bay -- we took that opportunity to complete STAR as well. And there was also turnaround in the Mid-Con as well. The second driver was inventory impacts. And you may remember from the fourth quarter, we actually had a tailwind. We built some inventory in the quarter. We wouldn't expect necessarily that inventory to impact the second quarter as well, but those things are volatile. And then one of the key benefits in the quarter was actually light product margins. In the second quarter, we gave guidance. But remember, we are very much front-half-weighted from a turnaround perspective. Actually, our guidance for Q2, roughly $400 million is above the first quarter actual turnaround expense. This will be for us four quarters of heavy turnaround somewhat unprecedented. We made what we think were some good decisions in early 2022 to delay turnaround to be sure that we did not have lost opportunity with respect to the heavy driving season and the increased demand. And similarly, when we think about the second quarter, we would expect that the months of May and June would see benefit as we look at the turnaround expense there. So I will pause there and see if maybe Rick and/or Brian want to add any incremental color with respect to the performance in the quarter. No, Paul, sorry about that. It is actually a negative impact in the first quarter. We actually built inventory in the quarter. Paul, we normally don't give that level of detail. It was not, however, the -- of those three elements, it was not the single largest driver. Yes. We had inventory builds across all regions, Paul. I think Mike has covered it well. We talked about ultimately carrying $1 billion. We've had some real life during COVID stress testing of that. We remain committed to our $1 billion. Your comment around interest, I think, is a real fair one. When you look at the -- our total interest and other financial costs. You can see over the last several quarters, the impact of the benefit of interest income on those cash balances as well, Sam. So I hope we've covered your question well. John, thanks for the question. It's Maryann. I'll give you a few high-level comments, and then I'm going to pass to Brian and Rick to give you a little more detail on the quarter. You're right, actually, as we talked about turnaround is slightly higher in the second quarter, but we will be touching less of the crude units just as an example. . And so while there is some planned maintenance, the impact of that should be less in the second quarter. Commercial performance, as you know, has been something that we have targeted for the last 18 months. We believe a lot of the work that we have done is sustainable and it certainly is a continued focus of the team as we head into the balance of the year. I'm going to pass it to Rick and Brian and let them give you a little more color on their expectations for Q2."

            "name": "Rick Hessling",
            "content": "Neil, it's Rick. Really, I think the way we look at it is -- we're looking at it from a global perspective. So we'll touch on the West Coast here in a moment. But when you think globally, it's a great call out to put Asia and Singapore in a bucket, but I'd also throw Europe into that bucket as well. And if we've learned anything over the last couple of years as trade flows and cracks or the world is more connected than it's ever been. So it's a really good call out in drawing if there is a truly impact to the U.S. refiners. One thing I'd say is as we look at Asia and Europe specifically, we actually see that as support for U.S. cracks. We see it as bullish for MPC. I mean we're hearing rumors of both regions you mentioned, Singapore and Asia and Europe, we're hearing rumors of run cuts there, which we see as bullish for us, especially on the West Coast, as you know, the incremental barrel at times comes from Asia. And if it doesn't come to the West Coast, we see that as positive for margins and cracks. And then lastly, I'd say our breakeven is structurally lower than it's been in the past. And as we view Europe as the marginal player in the world, we have a competitive advantage, as you know, on energy costs, feedstock acquisition, complexity of our refineries, our workforce, our reliability. And then last, but certainly not least, we have an incredible export -- global export program on products. So we're able to clear our markets quite well. So we believe if you -- when you add all of those up, Neil, it really gives us quite the competitive advantage, specifically in the West Coast, but I would say in PADDS 2, 3 and 5 where we operate. And with that, I'll ask Brian if he has any specific comments on products in the West Coast to add. Jason, it's Rick. So actually, we believe the market's been overdone, which is often the case in markets. When you look at Q4, one could say it was overdone to the positive for us. Right now, we're looking and saying it's overdone to the negative. And a lot of things are yet to play out. And what I mean by that is when you look at the OPEC+ announced cuts, what will they really cut? History says they announced something and then often do less. So we'll watch that play out throughout the global flows. But in addition to that, I think a dynamic that we've seen change, and we actually view as a positive for us in some instances as barrels are staying closer to home. So what do I mean by that? When you look at Gulf of Mexico production, you look at BP's Mad Dog 2, look at Shell's Vitol platforms that just came online, that's incremental production right in our backyard in the Gulf Coast. We have a really close pulse on Canadian production, and we're seeing upticks in Canadian production. And that's positive for us throughout our entire system. Then you have the Venezuelan barrels that have been in the news lately, the Chevron [Venz] barrels that we and others have taken advantage of. So I think this is yet to fully play out, Jason. I don't think it's as bad as it is today. Where it will go? That's a tough call. We just don't feel it is as depressed of an environment from a sweet-sour spread is what you're seeing today. And then lastly, I'll state, we were a big buyer of SPR barrels. Those barrels will just be coming into our system. That data is public. So when you add up all of the pluses and minuses, we actually feel a little more optimistic today going forward than pessimistic. John, it's Rick. So I'll just double-click on really the last item Maryann touched on. I can't emphasize enough under Mike's leadership, we've unpacked and changed everything we do commercially from A to Z, from feedstocks through finished products, there isn't anything that hasn't been looked at under the covers and redesigned where it needs to be redesigned. So as we look forward, a lot of people say, are you done? And Brian and I will say, will never be done. And Mike would tell us that on a daily basis rightfully. So with that being said, we do expect to continue to get incremental value by region going forward in every region we operate in. We're continuing on this journey and it's a journey that won't end. And it's quite the change for us corporately as we improve collaboratively from refining all the way through commercial. So if you can't tell, we're quite excited about it. And without giving too much detail, we would encourage you to stay tuned and continue to look at our results. Our boss tells us our results speak for themselves, and that's the mantra we live by and feel good about in this metric as you've seen over the last year or so."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me today on the call; Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. We remain committed to peer-leading operational excellence, commercial performance and profitability per barrel in each of the regions in which we operate, while being steadfast in our commitments to safely, reliably operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees. The global macro environment continues to exhibit refined product demand growth, and we expect 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption. Within our domestic and export businesses, we have seen steady year-over-year demand for gasoline and diesel and growth in demand for jet fuels. Refining margins were volatile in the third quarter as the market digested the implications of a light turnaround season, less seasonal supply interruptions than anticipated and the uncertainties around global economic growth, particularly the pace within China. By leveraging our fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast regions our portfolio of assets is well positioned to perform in this dynamic market environment. Beyond 2024, we expect demand growth to exceed the net impact of capacity additions and rationalizations through the end of the decade. These fundamentals support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining. The availability of low-cost energy, the complexity of our facilities and our domestic and international logistical capabilities are further increase our global competitive advantage. The U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. Operational excellence and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefit. Our disciplined long-term strategic and quick hit investments are allocated to projects that we believe will achieve attractive returns. These projects are expected to strengthen our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. We believe prioritization of these capabilities will ensure that our assets will remain the most competitive in each region in which we operate. Positioning us to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash generation and lead in capital allocation. In Midstream, MPLX continues to execute attractive growth opportunities anchored in the Permian and Marcellus basins. In the third quarter, MPLX began operations at Preakness II, a gas processing plant located in the Permian Basin and today announced an additional processing plant in the Northeast. The Harmon Creek III project will bring Northeast gas processing capacity to 8.1 billion cubic feet per day and fractionation capacity to 800,000 barrels per day once completed in the second half of 2026. Executing its wellhead-to-water strategy, MPLX progressed its natural gas and NGL pipeline projects including the capacity expansion of the BANGL natural gas liquids pipeline and Blackcomb natural gas pipeline in collaboration with its partners. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio, and therefore, its value proposition. Our Midstream segment, which is primarily comprised of MPLX has grown its adjusted EBITDA by over 6% and on a 3-year annual compound basis through 2023. This growth and the durability of its cash flow profile supported a 12.5% increase to its quarterly distribution increasing the expected annual cash distribution to MPC to $2.5 billion. As MPLX is able to grow its distribution, the cash flow MPC receives is expected to fully cover MPC's dividend and all of our capital programs in 2025. MPLX's growing portfolio and financial flexibility is expected to support this level of annual distribution increases in the future, strengthening the value proposition to MPC. MPC's total capital return since May 2021 has reduced MPC's share count by over 50% and following last week's announced 10% increase to MPC's dividends. Over the past 3 years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6%. We announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization. This will provide us flexibility to execute our peer-leading capital return commitment. Given our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we are positioned to lead peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle. MPC generated third quarter earnings per share of $1.87. This quarter, we delivered refining utilization at 94%, reflecting our operational excellence and value chain optimization. Utilization in the West Coast and Mid-Con regions was in the upper 90s, demonstrating strong reliability. Utilization in the U.S. Gulf Coast region reflected execution of turnaround activity. The team executed to deliver capture of 96%, reflecting strong commercial performance in a volatile market. Our capture improved by 2%, exceeding the rate of improvement achieved by our closest peers. This performance drove R&M segment adjusted EBITDA of $3.82 per barrel and cash from operations, excluding the impacts of working capital of $1.9 billion. And in the third quarter, we continue to lead our peers in capital return. The capabilities we have built provide a sustainable advantage, and we expect to continue to see the impact on our quarterly results. Let me turn the call over to John.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Slide 5 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second to third quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $900 million, driven by decreased results in our Refining and Marketing segment. The tax rate for the quarter was 10% reflecting the earnings mix between our R&M and Midstream businesses. Moving to our segment results. Slide 6 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the third quarter. Lower crack spreads reduced per barrel margin sequentially, our refineries ran at 94% utilization, processing nearly 2.8 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs for $5.30 per barrel in the third quarter, higher sequentially primarily due to lower throughputs and higher project-related expenses associated with increased turnaround activity. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing margin capture of 96% for the quarter, an improvement of 2% from the second quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by our operational and commercial team's execution of value-driven secondary product strategies as prices strengthened relative to gasoline quarter-over-quarter. This was partially offset by clean product margins declining sequentially, and we also continued to see headwinds from our renewals business during the quarter. Slide 8 shows our Midstream segment performance for the quarter. Our Midstream segment continues to deliver cash flow growth. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat sequentially but increased approximately 6% year-over-year, primarily due to higher throughputs and rates. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings growth as it advances projects targeted to enhance our natural gas and NGL value chains. Slide 9 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $1.9 billion in the quarter, driven by both our refining and midstream businesses. Working capital was a $179 million use of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by decreases in crude prices. This quarter, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions were $922 million, including $210 million for MPLX's acquisition of an additional 20% interest in the BANGL pipeline. MPC utilized cash to repay $750 million of debt due in the quarter, which we plan to refinance. MPC returned $2.7 billion through share repurchases and $273 million in dividends during the quarter and in October, we repurchased $500 million of MPC shares. At the end of the third quarter, MPC had approximately $5.1 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including MPLX cash of $2.4 billion. Turning to Slide 10. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. Our number one priority is sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We will invest where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. After meeting those requirements, we will return all excess capital through share repurchases even as we approach a more normalized balance sheet. And including the additional $5 billion announced this morning, we currently have $8.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorizations, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. As Maryann highlighted earlier, with our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX we are positioned to lead peers and capital returns through all market cycles. Turning to guidance on Slide 11. We provide our fourth quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of just over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 90%. Turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $285 million in the fourth quarter with activity focused in the Mid-Con region. Operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion and corporate costs are expected to be $200 million in the quarter. In summary, on Slide 13, this quarter, our R&M segment generated $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, and our Midstream segment delivered $1.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA. We invested $922 million in the business and returned $3 billion of capital. With that, let me pass it back to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, John. We are unwavering in our commitment to safe and reliable operations, operational excellence commercial execution and cost competitiveness yields sustainable structural benefits and position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance in each of the regions in which we operate. To deliver this, we will optimize our portfolio to deliver outperformance now and in the future. We'll leverage our value chain advantages and ensure the competitiveness of our assets while continuing to invest in our people. Our execution of these commitments position us to deliver the strongest through cycle cash generation. Durable midstream growth is expected to deliver cash flow uplift. Investing capital where we believe there are attractive returns will enhance our competitiveness now and for the future. We are committed to leading capital allocation and will return excess capital through share repurchases. MPC is positioned to create exceptional value through peer-leading performance, execution of our strategic commitments and its compelling value proposition. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. [Operator Instructions] Sheila, we are ready.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning Maryann and team, thanks for the rundown and good quarter here. I thought on the first topic, it would be good to get your perspective on was capital returns as you -- as we thought about 2024, you've been kind of run rating to $0.5 billion of buybacks a quarter. And as we -- as you think about 2025, the forward curve and your view of enhancement cycle relative to your cash balances. Just curious on your perspective on the level for 2025 it seems like $1.5 billion is what most investors are calibrating to and that ties into the $500 million you did in October, but just your perspective on the quarterly run rate of buybacks would be helpful.\nMaryann Mannen: First and foremost, we are committed to leading our peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle and that means returning all cash after our requirements to shareholders. When we think about mid-cycle, there's no doubt we see volatility. We've seen it in the last quarter and that volatility could continue. But we remain constructive on the long term when we look at the demand profile over the next decade. We look at the net if you will, between capacity additions that are coming online, we don't see anything beyond 2026 and you look at sort of the capacity that is actually coming offline as well we think over the long term, that remains an extremely constructive environment for us to operate. You mentioned a comment about sort of how we think about share repurchase beyond that period. Look, one of the things that we are trying to achieve is our peer-leading performance in all of the regions we operate. We're going to do that through commercial performance, we're going to do that through our operational excellence Therefore, we should have the strongest cash flow through cycle. And when we do that, we should then have the ability to lead our peers in capital allocation. Contributing to that, as I was mentioning in my comments is the durability of that midstream business. We saw the 12.5% increase in the distribution that we announced a few days ago and that brings about $2.5 billion to MPC on an annual basis, covers the MPC dividend, which, as you know, we just increased. And the capital, although we haven't given our capital guidance for 2025, highly likely it's going to cover our capital for 2025 as well. So again, just summarizing here, we expect that when we perform in this manner, we will have the strongest through-cycle cash flow and we'll be able to lead our peers in our capital allocation through share repurchase.\nNeil Mehta: Okay, Maryann. And then the follow-up is just on the West Coast, very volatile tough environment in Q3. Things seem to be getting better in Q4 and then you had the big announcement in L.A. -- in L.A. around retirement. So how do you think about the West Coast setup and some of the moving pieces as we go into the next year?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks, Neil. First, I think as we've been sharing over the last several quarters, we believe in our West Coast, we have one of the most competitive assets in the region. If you take a look at our performance in this quarter, we think the results on the West Coast demonstrate that. We've got a fairly sophisticated set of assets in that region it's a region where we have been monitoring for a long period of time. Frankly, if you go back to as early as 2020, we have been assessing the performance in that region and our ability to be profitable. We made a decision at that point in time to shutter the Martinez asset as a traditional fossil fuel refinery. So again, when we look at the capability of that asset, we look at the access waterborne, we look at our crude sourcing. We look at the capability for Canadian coming out of TMX. We think over the long term, those decisions that others are making as well bode well for us, and we remain committed to that West Coast region.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research.\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate: Maryann, I apologize for following up on the cash return question. But post-2026 is 2 years away for a rebalancing of global capacity, let's assume things remain soft on a margin outlook for a period of time, how much tolerance are you prepared to have on your balance sheet at the MPC level to fund your cash returns? I wonder if you could put a limit on where you would allow your balance sheet to get to?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes, one of the things we've shared for a period of time is the comfort that we have with our cash balance. And we remain comfortable, as we've shared in the past that about $1 billion is where we think our cash balances need to be on the MPC side. And again, part of that comfort comes from historically as we weathered other things like COVID, et cetera, and liquidity evaluations. Second, as I mentioned, we do have the benefit of our midstream cash flow, that durability of that stream, $2.5 billion coming to MPC. When we think about cash allocation, therefore, capital allocation, again, we intend to lead in capital allocation as we execute on the things that I mentioned, we should be able to have the strongest performance peer leading in each of the regions we operate, generating strongest cash flow and then we'll return that cash not necessary for other requirements via share buyback. So again, while the total may look different the commitment and the framework that we have been implementing doesn't change as we watch that mid-cycle return.\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate: So just to be clear, where would you like to see your net debt? Is there a limit?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. On the MPC side, we've always talked about being in a range of 25% to 30% debt to capital, and that's a gross number and we remain comfortable in that position. Today, we're sitting on under $6.5 billion of debt. That's simply because we've got about a $750 million refinance, and we intend to refinance that. We felt like when we looked at market environment and other volatility happening, it was beneficial for us to evaluate that. So that $750 million is intended to be refinanced it was a shorter-term decision as we look for opportunities to put that debt back on the balance sheet at their rates.\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate: Thanks for the clarification, Maryann. I guess my follow-up is related to your prepared remarks. I don't think I've heard you say this before, so I wonder if I could ask you to elaborate. We will optimize our portfolio to obviously maximize returns. It sounds like under your leadership, there's -- there's a portfolio review underway? Is there something that you're not happy with in the asset base? And I guess specifically, you still have additional amount of equity interest in multiple pipelines, I guess, could potentially be monetized. So I wonder if you could just elaborate on what you meant by optimize our portfolio.\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. Certainly, Doug. No, nothing different. One of our strategic pillars for a long time is ensuring the competitive nature of all of the assets in our portfolio. And so my comment there is our commitment that we are going to continue to evaluate those assets in the portfolio. Today, all of those assets are cash flow positive. But we'll ensure that, that competitive nature of those assets continues both today and in the future. So it is merely our commitment to ensure the competitive nature of our assets not anything different intended by that comment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.\nManav Gupta: My question is around the capital investment you're making. You've highlighted high return investments in Los Angeles and Galveston Bay refineries. Can you help us remind exactly what kind of projects you're doing over there? And obviously, to follow up a little bit on Neil's question. Your competitors are looking to shut refineries on the West Coast, and you're actually making an investment in Los Angeles. So help us understand that.\nMaryann Mannen: Certainly. So let me start with the West Coast. We talked earlier this year about an investment that we are making in our L.A. assets. We think that investment with roughly a 20% return. One helps us reduce Scope 1, Scope 2 emissions, gives us operational efficiency, reduces cost and ultimately will improve our competitiveness in that region in addition to giving us compliance for NOx emissions. But a 20% return, given the strength of that asset in the West Coast and what we believe to be certainly a competitive asset, we think, is an appropriate commitment to capital in that region. The other question that you were referencing our project -- excuse me, monopolize the project, the DHT in Galveston Bay. And again, another one that we talked about this year follow-on to our STAR project. This allows us with a similar return in that 20% range allows us to convert high sulfur diesel to ultra-low sulfur diesel. And particularly when you look at the curves going forward, again, we think will give us further competitive advantage on the U.S. Gulf Coast, given the strength of our asset there in that region. Let me pause and see if that answers your question.\nManav Gupta: No, that's perfect, Maryann. And my follow up a little bit on the midstream side, 12% -- 12.5% distribution growth. It kind of is getting to a point where you can grow MPC distribution as well as cover the CapEx. Just I'm trying to understand, are the opportunities you're looking in exclusively organic. Your press release is saying you can grow at 5% EBITDA organically, but are you also open to small bolt-on deals or JVs, minority interest in projects to grow your midstream business?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. Thank you for the question. So you're correct. We increased that MPLX distribution, as you say, 12.5% just a few days ago, really on the strength, the durability of our cash flows based on -- over the last 3 years, we've seen EBITDA grow at just under 7%. We've seen our distributable cash flow just under 8%. We believe there are a series of organic projects that can help us fuel that mid-single-digit growth. One of the things that we -- you don't see necessarily when you look at the amount of capital that we're putting to work in MPLX is the strength of our JVs. And as we grow those JVs that allocation is not included in the capital. So that's another source of continued growth for us. The other comment that you made also was really around our growth strategy that what we call our wellhead-to-water strategy and we think we've provided examples here, the increase in the BANGL ownership as we're looking at our NGL and nat gas and frankly, crude value chains as well. That wellhead water strategy is anchored in the Permian, we think those opportunities there to continue to capture the full value chain are extremely supportive of our ability to continue to support mid-single-digit growth in MPLX. And then the comment about whether or not we would look at other bolt-ons. If you look at the decision we made in the Utica, we think the opportunity for the Utica to increased utilization we made -- we did a transaction to buy out the rest of our JV partner there in the first quarter Summit. So we think we've got good examples of where we can continue to grow in mid-single-digit growth.\nOperator: Next, you will hear from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Maryann look like in the third quarter, your full [indiscernible] is really good, much better than your previous guide and then your turnaround expenses. Just curious that do you have a breakdown? How much of the better than expected throughput is due to better execute the turnaround? And how much is just the base operation or lesser unpinned downtime than you expected? And also from that standpoint, is the turnaround have you changed the process, how you're doing? In other words, that the improvement we see in the third quarter, is that repeatable?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. One of the things that I wanted to be sure that we talk about is our commitment to our operational performance. And you can see, as we've shared our commitment to peer-leading operational performance as well. We talk about commercial performance, giving us sustainable benefits, clearly, our operational performance, including our safe and reliable operations has given us sustainable benefits as well. I'm going to ask Tim to talk a little bit about the strengths of those capabilities and what it's done, frankly, with respect to our turnaround capabilities.\nTimothy Aydt: Hello Paul. We're routinely in the first quartile of Solomon on the turnaround performance. I think you probably recognized that in the past. And that's really based on our best-in-class procedures and processes that we have. But we're not standing still at all. we're continuing to improve and tweak these processes over time. And what we found really is that our -- when we execute our turnaround outages using this consistent approach, we do so across all of the facilities, and that leads to good results. I'd also point out that our large scale really allows us to assist the smaller plants, which then enables us the consistent performance regardless of the location. So I think that's another key benefit that you're seeing come through. And I'd also like to maybe take the opportunity to give a shout out to our teams as we had outstanding safety and environmental performance during our 4 fall turnarounds. So we had like zero OSHA recordables, zero lost time injuries, no significant environmental events all during these turnarounds this fall. So I think this is just yet another example of our safe and reliable focus and our operational excellence mindset. So hopefully, that helps.\nPaul Cheng: That's great. Maryann, can I ask the renewable diesel business. I think you are probably not making money in Martinez at least. And if we assume the margin environment remains flat at this level, what's the -- and after we take into consideration of the margin loss due to some BTC transition to PTC, what's the path to profitability? I mean what in term of you are doing that will be able to allow you to actually bridge the gap and be able to push it back up to making money?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. So on Martinez, first of all, as we have shared, we expect that by the end of the fourth quarter, we will have Martinez returning to full nameplate capacity on plan, right, and that's in the range of about 48,000 barrels a day. When you talk about profitability, actually make a comment here on the West Coast, as we are ramping up the challenges of profitability are there. If you exclude the impact of Martinez in our West Coast performance, our West Coast performance is actually positive in the quarter. As we go forward, we certainly believe that at full nameplate, we will be profitable, frankly, one of the more profitable renewable diesel facilities I'm going to pass to John because I think you had some questions also around BTC, and John is going to take you through that.\nJohn Quaid: Yes. Thanks, Maryann. Maryann really hit on it. The main factor for our Martinez facility and we're on track to do this is to get it back up to full capacity, again, running the advantaged feedstocks we can run there. So -- and Paul, as we look at that transition rate as BTC right now is set to expire here comes PTC. We're still waiting on regulations, et cetera. We'll prepare for all scenarios. But we would see longer term, the market will balance that out. But the key for us to be profitable on the West Coast is where we are now and being on track to getting back up to full capacity.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes, thanks. Maybe a couple of operational questions with some of the changes here. As we look at the West Coast and the changes coming here in, I guess, early '26 but maybe even a little sooner with some sort of unplanned downtime type items. How do you think about the incremental barrels coming to California. We've heard talk about it would be an Asian barrel. Historically, I would have said maybe Gulf Coast or even parts of Europe can bring California spec in but we've got closures coming in both of those locations. California, though, relative to the rest of your fleet and really the U.S. in general is pretty expensive place to operate. So what do you think about in terms of an incremental margin as California becomes more dependable or more dependent, excuse me, on an imported barrel?\nRick Hessling: Roger, it's Rick. So if you -- I won't speak for our competitors, but when you look at what has happened in the past, we believe it will most likely be an Asian barrel. South Korea is a logical choice. And I will tell you, Roger, that, that will introduce some new nuances to the state of California. We believe that could cause more volatility. You have increased transit time and you have market disruptors in terms of additional transportation costs to bring a barrel in. But specifically, I would tell you, South Korea/Asia will be the primary market where we believe imports would come from.\nRoger Read: Okay. And then on the Gulf Coast, we do have a company that's going to be closed in one of their units in January. They've pretty much confirmed that here in the last few days. Any thoughts on what that means for crude availability on the Gulf Coast? I mean, generally, a heavy crude unit, you've got heavy crude units on the Gulf Coast. Does it matter? Does the crude just go elsewhere and it doesn't really affect differentials? Just any thoughts along those lines?\nRick Hessling: Yes. Great question, Roger. So they are a big buyer of Canadian crudes. And as you know, the Gulf Coast market has a large appetite for it. When you rebalance the market, there will be winners and losers, and I will say that more incremental capacity into the Gulf Coast is a very good thing for the spread, we believe, and we should reap the benefits of that, especially at our Galveston Bay refinery.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: So my first question is just on seasonality within capture rates. You're tracking somewhere in the mid-90s on capture year-to-date. And when I look at the past couple of years, there's obviously always some quarter-to-quarter volatility, but that's not out of the ordinary for 1Q through 3Q. But 4Q has historically tended to be a big quarter from a capture perspective. So my question is, do you consider the year-to-date capture to be generally in line with what you would typically expect. And recognizing that there are a lot of moving pieces, but if you have a more kind of seasonally normal 4Q, could we expect the full year to average somewhere around that 100% range, so?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. John, thanks for your question. I think you know when we talk about capture, we think our commercial performance is a key deliverable particularly as we try to execute to be the most competitive in each region where we operate. To your point, if you look at the last several fourth quarters of our performance, our capture in the fourth quarter has been greater than the capture in the prior 3 quarters. There is nothing in the fourth quarter of 2024 that would tell us that, that behavior should be anything different at this point in time.\nJohn Royall: Great. That's exactly what I was looking for. And next one is maybe for John. If you could maybe talk a little bit about the potential timing for refinancing of the debt that you took out at the MPC level and what the use of proceeds could be there. Should we think about the 3Q buyback as maybe being held back a bit by that cash outflow and therefore, by the same token, maybe we could expect the proceeds to go back to buyback?\nJohn Quaid: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. I mean, as we discussed before, that was a maturity. We took the advantage of the flexibility of our balance sheet to opportunistically look to refinance that at the right time. We want to get maybe past an election and some other things before we -- we look to do that, but we'll do that at the right time. Again, to the earlier comments, we'll be comfortable with that level of debt as we look out longer term. So again, just trying to leverage some of the flexibility of the balance sheet to get the most optimal cost of that debt and we look to refinance it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: I want to go back -- I wanted to go back to the shareholder returns and focus on this minimum $1 billion of cash balance. And I guess the question is more about timing of getting to that $1 billion and as we think about heading into a weaker environment next year, are you looking to maybe retain a bit more cash above that cash balance so that you can deploy the excess cash on the balance sheet towards the buyback in a weaker environment? Or how do you exactly think about the timing of drawing that down?\nJohn Quaid: Jason, it's John. I'll take that. Look, when we look at that $1 billion target, that's -- that's what we look at minimum cash through a down cycle, right? That's what we're analyzing. So we remain very comfortable with that amount. And there's a couple of reasons why. You've heard a lot on the call today how we're confident in the competitiveness of our operations in each of the regions we operate and the things we're working on to drive positive cash flow. And then we've got this fantastic midstream investment in MPLX that continues to grow -- grow its distribution and drive $2.5 billion right now of annualized distributions back to MPC. So all of those factors are why we're very comfortable with that $1 billion, and it might differentiate us from maybe some of our peers that don't have that same business set. Hopefully, that helps.\nJason Gabelman: Yes, it does. The other question just on the quarterly results, you had mentioned that your capture trended better than peers. Just wondering if there's anything specific that drove that, that you could call out in the quarter or if it's something more structural?\nRick Hessling: This is Rick. I really would have to give a huge shout out to our Specialty Products teams. So oftentimes, Specialty Products is a headwind but when a market turns it's only as good as your team executing on the market turning. And when I think of some specific commodities that we don't often talk about, when I think of asphalt, pet chems, butane, and propane, we really did a great job. The team was phenomenal at capturing that market when it was there within the quarter. And I really am proud of them, and I truly believe they outperformed our competition. That, I would say, is the largest single call out.\nOperator: And that is all the time that we have for questions today.\nKristina Kazarian: Great. Thank you so much for joining us on our call today. If you should have follow-up questions, please reach out. The IR team is available all day to help you with your questions. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Maryann Mannen",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. We remain committed to peer-leading operational excellence, commercial performance and profitability per barrel in each of the regions in which we operate, while being steadfast in our commitments to safely, reliably operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees. The global macro environment continues to exhibit refined product demand growth, and we expect 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption. Within our domestic and export businesses, we have seen steady year-over-year demand for gasoline and diesel and growth in demand for jet fuels. Refining margins were volatile in the third quarter as the market digested the implications of a light turnaround season, less seasonal supply interruptions than anticipated and the uncertainties around global economic growth, particularly the pace within China. By leveraging our fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast regions our portfolio of assets is well positioned to perform in this dynamic market environment. Beyond 2024, we expect demand growth to exceed the net impact of capacity additions and rationalizations through the end of the decade. These fundamentals support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining. The availability of low-cost energy, the complexity of our facilities and our domestic and international logistical capabilities are further increase our global competitive advantage. The U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. Operational excellence and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefit. Our disciplined long-term strategic and quick hit investments are allocated to projects that we believe will achieve attractive returns. These projects are expected to strengthen our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. We believe prioritization of these capabilities will ensure that our assets will remain the most competitive in each region in which we operate. Positioning us to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash generation and lead in capital allocation. In Midstream, MPLX continues to execute attractive growth opportunities anchored in the Permian and Marcellus basins. In the third quarter, MPLX began operations at Preakness II, a gas processing plant located in the Permian Basin and today announced an additional processing plant in the Northeast. The Harmon Creek III project will bring Northeast gas processing capacity to 8.1 billion cubic feet per day and fractionation capacity to 800,000 barrels per day once completed in the second half of 2026. Executing its wellhead-to-water strategy, MPLX progressed its natural gas and NGL pipeline projects including the capacity expansion of the BANGL natural gas liquids pipeline and Blackcomb natural gas pipeline in collaboration with its partners. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio, and therefore, its value proposition. Our Midstream segment, which is primarily comprised of MPLX has grown its adjusted EBITDA by over 6% and on a 3-year annual compound basis through 2023. This growth and the durability of its cash flow profile supported a 12.5% increase to its quarterly distribution increasing the expected annual cash distribution to MPC to $2.5 billion. As MPLX is able to grow its distribution, the cash flow MPC receives is expected to fully cover MPC's dividend and all of our capital programs in 2025. MPLX's growing portfolio and financial flexibility is expected to support this level of annual distribution increases in the future, strengthening the value proposition to MPC. MPC's total capital return since May 2021 has reduced MPC's share count by over 50% and following last week's announced 10% increase to MPC's dividends. Over the past 3 years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6%. We announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization. This will provide us flexibility to execute our peer-leading capital return commitment. Given our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we are positioned to lead peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle. MPC generated third quarter earnings per share of $1.87. This quarter, we delivered refining utilization at 94%, reflecting our operational excellence and value chain optimization. Utilization in the West Coast and Mid-Con regions was in the upper 90s, demonstrating strong reliability. Utilization in the U.S. Gulf Coast region reflected execution of turnaround activity. The team executed to deliver capture of 96%, reflecting strong commercial performance in a volatile market. Our capture improved by 2%, exceeding the rate of improvement achieved by our closest peers. This performance drove R&M segment adjusted EBITDA of $3.82 per barrel and cash from operations, excluding the impacts of working capital of $1.9 billion. And in the third quarter, we continue to lead our peers in capital return. The capabilities we have built provide a sustainable advantage, and we expect to continue to see the impact on our quarterly results. Let me turn the call over to John. Thanks, John. We are unwavering in our commitment to safe and reliable operations, operational excellence commercial execution and cost competitiveness yields sustainable structural benefits and position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance in each of the regions in which we operate. To deliver this, we will optimize our portfolio to deliver outperformance now and in the future. We'll leverage our value chain advantages and ensure the competitiveness of our assets while continuing to invest in our people. Our execution of these commitments position us to deliver the strongest through cycle cash generation. Durable midstream growth is expected to deliver cash flow uplift. Investing capital where we believe there are attractive returns will enhance our competitiveness now and for the future. We are committed to leading capital allocation and will return excess capital through share repurchases. MPC is positioned to create exceptional value through peer-leading performance, execution of our strategic commitments and its compelling value proposition. Let me turn the call back to Kristina. First and foremost, we are committed to leading our peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle and that means returning all cash after our requirements to shareholders. When we think about mid-cycle, there's no doubt we see volatility. We've seen it in the last quarter and that volatility could continue. But we remain constructive on the long term when we look at the demand profile over the next decade. We look at the net if you will, between capacity additions that are coming online, we don't see anything beyond 2026 and you look at sort of the capacity that is actually coming offline as well we think over the long term, that remains an extremely constructive environment for us to operate. You mentioned a comment about sort of how we think about share repurchase beyond that period. Look, one of the things that we are trying to achieve is our peer-leading performance in all of the regions we operate. We're going to do that through commercial performance, we're going to do that through our operational excellence Therefore, we should have the strongest cash flow through cycle. And when we do that, we should then have the ability to lead our peers in capital allocation. Contributing to that, as I was mentioning in my comments is the durability of that midstream business. We saw the 12.5% increase in the distribution that we announced a few days ago and that brings about $2.5 billion to MPC on an annual basis, covers the MPC dividend, which, as you know, we just increased. And the capital, although we haven't given our capital guidance for 2025, highly likely it's going to cover our capital for 2025 as well. So again, just summarizing here, we expect that when we perform in this manner, we will have the strongest through-cycle cash flow and we'll be able to lead our peers in our capital allocation through share repurchase. Yes. Thanks, Neil. First, I think as we've been sharing over the last several quarters, we believe in our West Coast, we have one of the most competitive assets in the region. If you take a look at our performance in this quarter, we think the results on the West Coast demonstrate that. We've got a fairly sophisticated set of assets in that region it's a region where we have been monitoring for a long period of time. Frankly, if you go back to as early as 2020, we have been assessing the performance in that region and our ability to be profitable. We made a decision at that point in time to shutter the Martinez asset as a traditional fossil fuel refinery. So again, when we look at the capability of that asset, we look at the access waterborne, we look at our crude sourcing. We look at the capability for Canadian coming out of TMX. We think over the long term, those decisions that others are making as well bode well for us, and we remain committed to that West Coast region. Yes, one of the things we've shared for a period of time is the comfort that we have with our cash balance. And we remain comfortable, as we've shared in the past that about $1 billion is where we think our cash balances need to be on the MPC side. And again, part of that comfort comes from historically as we weathered other things like COVID, et cetera, and liquidity evaluations. Second, as I mentioned, we do have the benefit of our midstream cash flow, that durability of that stream, $2.5 billion coming to MPC. When we think about cash allocation, therefore, capital allocation, again, we intend to lead in capital allocation as we execute on the things that I mentioned, we should be able to have the strongest performance peer leading in each of the regions we operate, generating strongest cash flow and then we'll return that cash not necessary for other requirements via share buyback. So again, while the total may look different the commitment and the framework that we have been implementing doesn't change as we watch that mid-cycle return. Yes. On the MPC side, we've always talked about being in a range of 25% to 30% debt to capital, and that's a gross number and we remain comfortable in that position. Today, we're sitting on under $6.5 billion of debt. That's simply because we've got about a $750 million refinance, and we intend to refinance that. We felt like when we looked at market environment and other volatility happening, it was beneficial for us to evaluate that. So that $750 million is intended to be refinanced it was a shorter-term decision as we look for opportunities to put that debt back on the balance sheet at their rates. Yes. Certainly, Doug. No, nothing different. One of our strategic pillars for a long time is ensuring the competitive nature of all of the assets in our portfolio. And so my comment there is our commitment that we are going to continue to evaluate those assets in the portfolio. Today, all of those assets are cash flow positive. But we'll ensure that, that competitive nature of those assets continues both today and in the future. So it is merely our commitment to ensure the competitive nature of our assets not anything different intended by that comment. Certainly. So let me start with the West Coast. We talked earlier this year about an investment that we are making in our L.A. assets. We think that investment with roughly a 20% return. One helps us reduce Scope 1, Scope 2 emissions, gives us operational efficiency, reduces cost and ultimately will improve our competitiveness in that region in addition to giving us compliance for NOx emissions. But a 20% return, given the strength of that asset in the West Coast and what we believe to be certainly a competitive asset, we think, is an appropriate commitment to capital in that region. The other question that you were referencing our project -- excuse me, monopolize the project, the DHT in Galveston Bay. And again, another one that we talked about this year follow-on to our STAR project. This allows us with a similar return in that 20% range allows us to convert high sulfur diesel to ultra-low sulfur diesel. And particularly when you look at the curves going forward, again, we think will give us further competitive advantage on the U.S. Gulf Coast, given the strength of our asset there in that region. Let me pause and see if that answers your question. Yes. Thank you for the question. So you're correct. We increased that MPLX distribution, as you say, 12.5% just a few days ago, really on the strength, the durability of our cash flows based on -- over the last 3 years, we've seen EBITDA grow at just under 7%. We've seen our distributable cash flow just under 8%. We believe there are a series of organic projects that can help us fuel that mid-single-digit growth. One of the things that we -- you don't see necessarily when you look at the amount of capital that we're putting to work in MPLX is the strength of our JVs. And as we grow those JVs that allocation is not included in the capital. So that's another source of continued growth for us. The other comment that you made also was really around our growth strategy that what we call our wellhead-to-water strategy and we think we've provided examples here, the increase in the BANGL ownership as we're looking at our NGL and nat gas and frankly, crude value chains as well. That wellhead water strategy is anchored in the Permian, we think those opportunities there to continue to capture the full value chain are extremely supportive of our ability to continue to support mid-single-digit growth in MPLX. And then the comment about whether or not we would look at other bolt-ons. If you look at the decision we made in the Utica, we think the opportunity for the Utica to increased utilization we made -- we did a transaction to buy out the rest of our JV partner there in the first quarter Summit. So we think we've got good examples of where we can continue to grow in mid-single-digit growth. Yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. One of the things that I wanted to be sure that we talk about is our commitment to our operational performance. And you can see, as we've shared our commitment to peer-leading operational performance as well. We talk about commercial performance, giving us sustainable benefits, clearly, our operational performance, including our safe and reliable operations has given us sustainable benefits as well. I'm going to ask Tim to talk a little bit about the strengths of those capabilities and what it's done, frankly, with respect to our turnaround capabilities. Yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. So on Martinez, first of all, as we have shared, we expect that by the end of the fourth quarter, we will have Martinez returning to full nameplate capacity on plan, right, and that's in the range of about 48,000 barrels a day. When you talk about profitability, actually make a comment here on the West Coast, as we are ramping up the challenges of profitability are there. If you exclude the impact of Martinez in our West Coast performance, our West Coast performance is actually positive in the quarter. As we go forward, we certainly believe that at full nameplate, we will be profitable, frankly, one of the more profitable renewable diesel facilities I'm going to pass to John because I think you had some questions also around BTC, and John is going to take you through that. Yes. John, thanks for your question. I think you know when we talk about capture, we think our commercial performance is a key deliverable particularly as we try to execute to be the most competitive in each region where we operate. To your point, if you look at the last several fourth quarters of our performance, our capture in the fourth quarter has been greater than the capture in the prior 3 quarters. There is nothing in the fourth quarter of 2024 that would tell us that, that behavior should be anything different at this point in time."

            "content": "Thanks, Maryann. Slide 5 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second to third quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $900 million, driven by decreased results in our Refining and Marketing segment. The tax rate for the quarter was 10% reflecting the earnings mix between our R&M and Midstream businesses. Moving to our segment results. Slide 6 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the third quarter. Lower crack spreads reduced per barrel margin sequentially, our refineries ran at 94% utilization, processing nearly 2.8 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs for $5.30 per barrel in the third quarter, higher sequentially primarily due to lower throughputs and higher project-related expenses associated with increased turnaround activity. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing margin capture of 96% for the quarter, an improvement of 2% from the second quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by our operational and commercial team's execution of value-driven secondary product strategies as prices strengthened relative to gasoline quarter-over-quarter. This was partially offset by clean product margins declining sequentially, and we also continued to see headwinds from our renewals business during the quarter. Slide 8 shows our Midstream segment performance for the quarter. Our Midstream segment continues to deliver cash flow growth. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat sequentially but increased approximately 6% year-over-year, primarily due to higher throughputs and rates. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings growth as it advances projects targeted to enhance our natural gas and NGL value chains. Slide 9 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $1.9 billion in the quarter, driven by both our refining and midstream businesses. Working capital was a $179 million use of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by decreases in crude prices. This quarter, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions were $922 million, including $210 million for MPLX's acquisition of an additional 20% interest in the BANGL pipeline. MPC utilized cash to repay $750 million of debt due in the quarter, which we plan to refinance. MPC returned $2.7 billion through share repurchases and $273 million in dividends during the quarter and in October, we repurchased $500 million of MPC shares. At the end of the third quarter, MPC had approximately $5.1 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including MPLX cash of $2.4 billion. Turning to Slide 10. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. Our number one priority is sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We will invest where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. After meeting those requirements, we will return all excess capital through share repurchases even as we approach a more normalized balance sheet. And including the additional $5 billion announced this morning, we currently have $8.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorizations, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. As Maryann highlighted earlier, with our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX we are positioned to lead peers and capital returns through all market cycles. Turning to guidance on Slide 11. We provide our fourth quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of just over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 90%. Turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $285 million in the fourth quarter with activity focused in the Mid-Con region. Operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion and corporate costs are expected to be $200 million in the quarter. In summary, on Slide 13, this quarter, our R&M segment generated $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, and our Midstream segment delivered $1.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA. We invested $922 million in the business and returned $3 billion of capital. With that, let me pass it back to Maryann. Yes. Thanks, Maryann. Maryann really hit on it. The main factor for our Martinez facility and we're on track to do this is to get it back up to full capacity, again, running the advantaged feedstocks we can run there. So -- and Paul, as we look at that transition rate as BTC right now is set to expire here comes PTC. We're still waiting on regulations, et cetera. We'll prepare for all scenarios. But we would see longer term, the market will balance that out. But the key for us to be profitable on the West Coast is where we are now and being on track to getting back up to full capacity. Yes. Thanks for the question, John. I mean, as we discussed before, that was a maturity. We took the advantage of the flexibility of our balance sheet to opportunistically look to refinance that at the right time. We want to get maybe past an election and some other things before we -- we look to do that, but we'll do that at the right time. Again, to the earlier comments, we'll be comfortable with that level of debt as we look out longer term. So again, just trying to leverage some of the flexibility of the balance sheet to get the most optimal cost of that debt and we look to refinance it. Jason, it's John. I'll take that. Look, when we look at that $1 billion target, that's -- that's what we look at minimum cash through a down cycle, right? That's what we're analyzing. So we remain very comfortable with that amount. And there's a couple of reasons why. You've heard a lot on the call today how we're confident in the competitiveness of our operations in each of the regions we operate and the things we're working on to drive positive cash flow. And then we've got this fantastic midstream investment in MPLX that continues to grow -- grow its distribution and drive $2.5 billion right now of annualized distributions back to MPC. So all of those factors are why we're very comfortable with that $1 billion, and it might differentiate us from maybe some of our peers that don't have that same business set. Hopefully, that helps."

            "content": "Hello Paul. We're routinely in the first quartile of Solomon on the turnaround performance. I think you probably recognized that in the past. And that's really based on our best-in-class procedures and processes that we have. But we're not standing still at all. we're continuing to improve and tweak these processes over time. And what we found really is that our -- when we execute our turnaround outages using this consistent approach, we do so across all of the facilities, and that leads to good results. I'd also point out that our large scale really allows us to assist the smaller plants, which then enables us the consistent performance regardless of the location. So I think that's another key benefit that you're seeing come through. And I'd also like to maybe take the opportunity to give a shout out to our teams as we had outstanding safety and environmental performance during our 4 fall turnarounds. So we had like zero OSHA recordables, zero lost time injuries, no significant environmental events all during these turnarounds this fall. So I think this is just yet another example of our safe and reliable focus and our operational excellence mindset. So hopefully, that helps."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. I want to take a moment to recognize Mike Hennigan's leadership as CEO of MPC over the last 4 years. Mike's record of accomplishment has been tremendously valuable. During his tenure, Mike delivered its transformative strategic priorities and returned a peer-leading $40 billion to shareholders. We're fortunate to have Mike as Executive Chairman of MPC's Board going forward. Moving to the global macro environment. In the second quarter, supply of refined products reached all-time seasonal highs. The margin environment supported assets running at high utilization and new capacity additions continue to ramp. At the same time, demand for refined products set new records globally. We expect 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption. Within MPC's domestic and export businesses, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline and diesel and growing demand for jet fuel. As we look forward, demand growth is expected to outpace near-term capacity additions over time with limited global refining capacity additions expected through the end of the decade. These fundamentals still support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining. The U.S. refining industry is expected to remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. We believe our assets will remain the most competitive in each region in which we operate. Our fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast regions provide us with a competitive advantage. We are steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees. Operational excellence and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, uniquely positioning us to capture market opportunities. Our execution remains core to our value delivery. Our disciplined capital investments are focused on high-return projects. In refining, we are making investments predominantly in our large competitively advantaged facilities to optimize our assets and position MPC well into the future. In midstream, MPLX continues to execute attractive growth opportunities focused on bringing in incremental third-party cash flows. We continue to grow our natural gas and NGL value chains. In the second quarter, MPLX closed the Whistler transaction. Last week, MPLX and its partners reached FID on the Blackcomb natural gas pipeline. It will be a 2.5 Bcf pipeline connecting supply in the Permian to domestic and export markets along the Gulf Coast. This project offers a compelling value proposition while providing shippers with flexible market access. Blackcomb is expected to be in service in the second half of 2026. Additionally, MPLX recently increased its ownership in BANGL. This pipeline transports NGLs from the Permian to Sweeny, Texas, and it is currently expanding its capacity to 250,000 barrels a day. This transaction is immediately accretive and enhances MPLX's Permian NGL value chain as part of its developing wellhead-to-water strategy. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio, providing a $2.2 billion annualized cash distribution to MPC. This fully covers MPC's dividend and nearly all of our 2024 capital program. And our Midstream segment, which is primarily comprised of MPLX, has grown its adjusted EBITDA at nearly 7% compound annual growth rate over the last 3 years. Strong coverage, low leverage and growing cash flows provide MPLX financial flexibility, placing it in an excellent position to continue to significantly grow its distributions, further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. MPLX -- sorry, MPC's total capital return since May 2021 has reduced MPC share count by nearly 50%. Cash generation will continue to influence buyback capacity as we return to a normalized balance sheet. Given our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.2 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we believe we can lead peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle. MPC generated second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $4.12. Our operational excellence and commercial performance support our quarterly results. This quarter, we delivered refining utilization at 97%, capture of 94%, up 2%, while other refining peers reported sequential declines. Adjusted R&M EBITDA per barrel of $7.07 and cash from operations, excluding the impacts of working capital of $2.7 billion, both of which led refining peers, and we returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders. The capabilities we have built provide a sustainable advantage, and we expect to continue to see the impact on our quarterly results. Let me turn the call over to John.\nJohn Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Slide 5 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2024 to second quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially by $133 million, driven by increased results in both our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segments. The tax rate for the quarter was 16%, resulting in a tax provision of $373 million. The second quarter tax rate largely reflects the earnings mix between our R&M and midstream businesses. Moving to our segment results. Slide 6 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the second quarter. Following significant turnaround activity in the first quarter, our refineries ran at 97% utilization, processing nearly 2.9 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs were $4.97 per barrel in the second quarter, lower, sequentially, primarily due to higher throughputs, lower project-related expenses associated with reduced turnaround activity and lower energy costs. In our largest region, the U.S. Gulf Coast, our operating costs were $3.73 per barrel, demonstrating our cost competitiveness. Sequentially, per barrel margins were down primarily due to lower crack spreads. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture of 94% for the quarter. Capture in the quarter reflected tailwinds from gasoline margins, offset by increased headwinds from secondary product pricing, which was driven by high refining industry utilization. Gasoline margins were supported by a falling price environment during the quarter and, in addition, our integrated system and realized demand across our multiple sales channels was a competitive differentiator to our capture performance. Slide 8 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2024. Our Midstream segment is generating strong cash flows. This quarter, MPLX distributions contributed $550 million in cash flow to MPC. The 2 midstream transactions Maryann discussed earlier further enhance our Permian value chains for both natural gas and NGLs. Through organic growth and disciplined investments, MPLX continues to provide growing cash flows to MPC. MPLX is a differentiator in the MPC portfolio and remains a source of durable earnings growth. Slide 9 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $2.7 billion in the quarter, driven by both our refining and midstream businesses. Working capital was a $541 million source of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by the decrease in refined product prices. This quarter, capital expenditures and investments were $541 million. And during the second quarter, MPLX issued $1.65 billion in tenured senior notes, the proceeds of which MPLX expects to use to retire senior notes maturing in December of this year and February of next year. MPC returned $2.9 billion through share repurchases and $290 million in dividends during the quarter. And in July, we repurchased just over $900 million of MPC shares, leaving $5.8 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations and highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $6 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, excluding cash at MPLX. Turning to guidance. On Slide 10, we provide our third quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of just over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing a utilization of 90%. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $330 million in the third quarter, with activity focused in the Mid-Con and Gulf Coast regions. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be approximately $1.4 billion. Operating costs are projected to be $5.35 per barrel in the third quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.55 billion and corporate costs are expected to be $200 million. In summary, our second quarter results reflect strong cash generation and disciplined capital allocation. The R&M segment generated $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA and MPLX distributed $550 million to MPC. This supported investments of over $500 million and capital return of approximately $3.2 billion. With that, let me pass it back to Maryann.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, John. My priorities are consistent with those that made MPC a peer-leading energy investment. We are unwavering in our commitment to safe and reliable operations. Operational excellence, commercial execution and our cost competitiveness yield sustainable structural benefits and position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance irrespective of the market environment. To do this, we will optimize our portfolio to deliver outperformance now and in the future. We'll leverage our value chain advantages, ensure the competitiveness of our assets and continue to invest in our people. Our execution of these commitments position us to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash generation. Durable midstream growth should deliver cash flow uplift. We will invest capital but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness. We are committed to leading in capital allocation. We will return excess capital through share repurchases. MPC is positioned to create exceptional value through peer-leading performance, execution of our strategic commitments and a compelling value proposition. Let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. We will now open the call. Sheila?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.\nManav Gupta: Congratulations on a very strong start. And looking at all these very attractive projects that you're doing in midstream, Maryann, like BANGL and Whistler and now Blackcomb. And looking at the way the distribution is growing at MPLX, like is the thought process somewhere here to try and grow the distribution at MPLX for 10%. And even if you can do it for 2 more years, that distribution to MPC jumps to like 2.7-plus, at that point, is covering your full CapEx and full dividend. So technically, you are a recession-proof refiner.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Manav. I think you said it well. The strategy that we are trying to execute in MPLX, we've talked about targeting mid-single-digit growth. As you've seen over the last 3 years, we've achieved that almost 8% in distributable cash flows as well. And to your point, we have increased the dividend over the last 3 years and more so in the last 2 years, 10% per year. We believe that our strategies, wellhead-to-water, as we explained, and the key initiatives that you just articulated for me, our investment in BANGL, our JV in the Utica, Whistler. And then also just recently, the FID of Blackcomb, we think, continue to support our ability to deliver in growing mid-single-digit growth. Therefore, our goal of increasing that distribution and bringing it back to MPC creates, we believe, incremental strategic value between MPC and MPLX. And as you stated well, that will fully cover the MPC dividend and largely the capital that heretofore MPC has been putting to work. So again, we think that strategic relationship becomes incredibly more important as we are able to increase MPLX's distribution going forward.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. And a very quick follow-up is, looking at the Gulf Coast OpEx, I think, $3.72 is the lowest in the business. It's like probably the lowest. Help us understand what's been the drivers of this because probably 3 or 4 years ago, you were not the lowest cost Gulf Coast operator. Looks like you've now gotten there. So help us understand some of the initiatives? And can this be sustained here?\nMaryann Mannen: Manav, thanks. So as you know, one of our key initiatives, one of our priorities with respect to our peer-leading initiatives has been profitability per barrel. And we see that as a cost competitive commitment, if you will, in each of the regions where we operate. As we've been talking about for the last few years, the work that we have been doing, we believe, is sustainable. Ultimately, again, what we're trying to do is to deliver the best EBITDA per barrel in each of those regions. We appreciate your recognition of the Gulf Coast. I'll pass it to Rick to see if he wants to add any comments on the Gulf Coast.\nRick Hessling: Yes. So on the Gulf Coast, I will share that with utilization where it's at. We believe it to be a highly constructive market going forward and continue to rebound, Manav.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Maryann, I wanted to kick off with you. As you take on the reins of the business in the CEO role. Can you talk about the first 6 months on the job. What are your key objectives? And what are you focused on here?\nMaryann Mannen: Neil, thank you. I'll say, first and foremost, continuing to create exceptional value. As we've shared here and tried to articulate here this morning, we believe we can deliver the strongest EBITDA per barrel and cash flow per share. And we're going to continue to focus on notwithstanding our safe and reliable operations every day, all day, delivering outstanding operational excellence, commercial performance. We talked a little bit about that here that will be a focus as we go forward to ensure that our profitability per barrel is the strongest. Ultimately, at the end of the day, we want to have our peer-leading capital allocation, and we'll continue to drive all that we do to ensure that those allocation principles return on and return of are peer-leading. I shared a little bit. We're going to continue to do that, leveraging our value chain. We also want to ensure as we always have the competitive nature of those assets, it's something that we will continually evaluate. And then last, as we talk about one of the things that I just shared here is the durable midstream growth in our -- with the cash flows, we think that is another compelling value proposition for MPC. And with all that, we should be able to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash flow. I think those are the things that you will see me continue to focus on not only in the next 6 months, but continuously as we drive value for our shareholders.\nNeil Mehta: And if I can drill down on one specific item. Over the last couple of years, the business and the value has really been created largely organically. There are some questions about whether you pursue M&A in the renewable diesel space. There was some trade articles around Neste in particular. So just love your comments on how do you create value in that business and any thoughts around that specifically?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes. Sure, Neil. Let me address the Neste one, first. I heard you mention that. That rumor is not factual, and we are not having any conversations about a buyout with Neste. So just want to be sure that I address that. As we continue to look at the opportunities, we do see value within our portfolio. I mentioned the competitive nature of each of our regions. We continue to see opportunities there to drive performance. We are focused on our commercial performance and continuing to deliver the strongest EBIT per barrel, as I mentioned. So right now we see the opportunities within our own portfolio, and we'll continue to evaluate as we go forward over the long term how to deliver that value proposition. But we see our ability to grow organically.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Two questions, please. I think the first one is probably for Rick. Rick for TMX, it has been -- I've been wondering for a number of months. Do you think that all the impact has already been felt in the marketplace? Or you believe there's more to come. We are surprised that 2/3 of the incremental barrel seems like being exported to Asia. And how that additional barrel in the West Coast may or may not have changed your operation in the West Coast, in terms of your crude slate and product yield? That's the first question. And second question, maybe for John. On your Page 18, there's an Other margin, say, $108 million. Can you maybe share a little bit more detail? What's inside there?\nMaryann Mannen: Paul, thank you. So on TMX, first and foremost, I think we've been talking about this for the last several quarters. And what I would share with you is the start-up of TMX has largely happened as we anticipated and the results of that very similar to the way that we believe that would play out in the marketplace. So pretty consistent as we've shared. I'm going to pass it to Rick and allow him to give you some incremental color in particular on what's happening in the West Coast.\nRick Hessling: Yes. Paul, it's Rick. Just a few comments here. Really, no surprises. I would tell you from a yield perspective, the changes are insignificant from our perspective. What has changed, though, that is significant and quite helpful to us, actually, is as these incremental Canadian barrels have come into the market, it has put pressure on the ANS barrel. And as you're well aware, we're a big buyer and runner of ANS barrels on the West Coast. So we're a recipient of that. So that's been very positive for us. And then obviously, with our commitment on TMX, we have the ability to run these advantaged barrels not only at Anacortes, but at LA. So it's been very positive for us, see it being that way going forward, Paul. And then in terms of the export comment to Asia, not surprising at all. In fact, we expect that plus or minus will continue. And Paul, that will largely be dependent on differentials and your quality differentials and your transportation, shipping transportation to the West Coast. So when you factor in those 2 variables, you'll be able to back into what will happen here going forward.\nJohn Quaid: Paul, it's John. On the other margin change you see for R&M, not all of it, but it primarily relates to us finalizing our insurance claim for the Galveston Bay reformer. So we would have finalized that, recognize that income in the first quarter and then receive the cash proceeds in Q2. So you have that recognition in Q1, but again, it's the final one. So there's really nothing to offset it in Q2. That's what's driving the change you're seeing there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Congrats, Maryann on everything. I'd just like to maybe take a couple of shots at some of the macro stuff here. As we think about the let's -- what we call better than mid-cycle, but whatever new mid-cycle, how you're looking at the structure of the market? And then how that fits in with what's generally been higher utilization throughout the industry, putting a little pressure on cracks here at least for a few months this summer. How maybe you think that works out as we look out over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months?\nMaryann Mannen: Sure, Roger, thanks. A couple of things I'd say. First and foremost, over the long haul, we continue to believe in an enhanced mid-cycle, it will continue in the U.S. Clearly, in the short term, we talked a little bit about what we saw happen in Q1, Q2. Q2 coming off of pretty high turnaround across the space on -- in Q1. And then you see, obviously, continued volatility here, supply demand. But over the long haul, as I mentioned, we do not see really any challenge there. There could be supply that comes online. But when you look at demand that we are expecting over the long term, we think that will be absorbed, clearly some short term. China, obviously, that in just recent reports there in terms of where their demands flow is decisions by OPEC, all of which we think could have some short-term volatility. But over the long term, enhanced mid-cycle, we believe, depending on how you think about that mid-cycle, one of the ways that we like to articulate, we're running 1 billion barrels. If you think it's a $1, it's an incremental $1 billion to the MPC portfolio, just a way for you to maybe frame that. I'll pass it to Rick and let him give you a little more color there.\nRick Hessling: Yes. Roger, just a few more comments. So when you look, S&D is really in line with our expectations. It's really what we -- what and where we thought it would be. But when you drill down even further and look at utilization closer to home domestically over the last couple of weeks, even domestic utilization is off some 4%, ironically, bringing us to this 90% utilization level, which is where our guidance is going forward. So we see that as continuing to be very constructive. And then I'll just spend a moment talking about our demand. Our demand within MPC, both domestically and from an export perspective is very steady on the gas and diesel side, and we're seeing really strong signals on the jet side. So we believe those tailwinds, combined with the supply and demand picture, that's truly in balance further backs up our mid-cycle plus thoughts going forward.\nRoger Read: I appreciate that. You kind of clip me on my follow-up on the demand side, so I'll leave it there and turn it back to you all.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: So my first question is just looking at your 90% utilization guide for 3Q. It's pretty low for MPC for 3Q. There is a fair amount of turnaround activity it appears just from the total turnaround dollars. But my question is, is there any economic downtime or pulling forward a turnaround activity or any -- in any way, any kind of response to the weaker crack environment buried in that 90%?\nJohn Quaid: John, it's John. I'll take that to start. You're spot on with the turnaround comment really largely what you're seeing, right, we've got activity, as I mentioned, in the Mid-Con and the Gulf Coast, that's going to affect what we're going to be able to run. And then I'll make an initial comment, turn it over to Rick if he has any further. But really, we're going to continue to run our assets optimally to meet the demand in the market.\nRick Hessling: Yes, John nailed it. We will run economically and 90% is the guidance that we think is a fair number going forward as we're 1/3 of the way through the quarter.\nJohn Royall: Great. And then I was just hoping for a little color operationally on how Martinez is running and ramping towards the target of getting to full by year-end. And relatedly, do you have any concerns about the price of feedstocks getting driven up by a combination of Martinez ramping back to full and Rodeo coming on and ramping its runs of lower feedstocks.\nTimothy Aydt: Yes, John, this is Tim. I'll take that one. We continue to believe Martinez is a highly competitive facility. And in the second quarter, we did bring a second unit back online, which did provide us with the ability to run at 75% of the nameplate capacity. And as we have noted in the past, we expect to bring the last production unit online by the end of this year, which would allow the plant to run at 100% of its nameplate capacity. So we're on track for that.\nOperator: Next, you will hear from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: I wanted to ask, firstly, on shareholder returns and the pace of buybacks moving forward. 2Q was a very strong buyback quarter. If I look adjusting for working capital the past couple of quarters, net debt has increased about $1.5 billion at the parent. I'm just wondering if that's indicative on how you're managing the balance sheet, moving forward as you continue to deploy that excess capacity towards buybacks? Or conversely, do you become a bit more cautious here in the near term with potential for some dislocations perhaps in the stock price moving forward, should things continue to weaken, that maybe presents a more advantageous price to buy at.\nMaryann Mannen: Jason, thanks. With respect to buyback, I appreciate the comment on the second quarter, you could see $2.9 billion in the quarter. We continue to see share buyback as an appropriate return of capital, particularly when you look at the current equity price of MPC and what we believe to be over the long term, the growth and opportunity in this equity. So you'll continue to see us use cash to buy back stock. Again, no change to that view as we look at that. Part of the reason you saw that change in net debt, obviously, is quarter-over-quarter. You saw the drawdown in cash. We've talked about what looks like a reasonable place for us to be in terms of the cash position. I can have John share a little bit more about that with you. But we're not near there. So we continue to believe in buybacks, and we'll go forward with that.\nJason Gabelman: Great. And my follow-up is just specifically on results in the Mid-Con. Gross margin came in very strong. I was wondering what drove that? If there was any onetime items or items you would call out for the quarter?\nRick Hessling: Jason, it's Rick Hessling, so no onetime items. What I would tell you is we believe a competitive advantage of our assets in the Mid-Con is our fully integrated system. We've been working for many years to create optionality from what we call cradle to grave when you think refining all the way through our end consumer. And we believe this is and will continue to pull through on our results.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Carlos Escalante with Wolfe Research.\nCarlos Escalante: This is Carlos. Doug sends his apologies. First of all, congrats on the quarter end. I suppose we would like to know what the appropriate dividend growth policy would be a resumable buyback slowdown, especially considering how strong your MPLX distribution is insofar as providing coverage for you guys in that end.\nMaryann Mannen: Thanks for the question, Carlos. With respect to our dividend policy, no change in how we think about that. Some criteria. One, we want that dividend to have the ability to grow. And over the last few years, we look at that in the third quarter, and we'll do so again. But over the last few years, we've grown that dividend over a period of time, about 12.5% compound annual growth in the change of that dividend. We want that dividend to be sustainable and we want that dividend obviously to be competitive. So we'll take another look at that and share with you as we head into the third quarter as we have in prior years. We continue to believe that when we talk about return on capital, we're looking at both dividend and share repurchase, but that our share repurchase is the primary vehicle for us in the return of capital strategy.\nCarlos Escalante: And you actually -- that's a good segue for my follow-up question, which is, in the software market, where would your priority be on that same balance of buybacks over balance sheet? And would you consider relevering the balance sheet and to what extent if that's what you choose to do?\nMaryann Mannen: No, I don't think we would relever the balance sheet. We've talked about our strategy and structure as it relates to debt to cap. We'll continue to look at that, but don't see a reason at this point that we would relever the MPC balance sheet.\nOperator: Next question will come from Matthew Blair with TPH.\nMatthew Blair: Congrats on the remarkable quarter. On the refining side, the slides mentioned tailwinds on capture in Q2 from a rise in gasoline margins. But we noticed that you're gasoline yields was actually a little lower than normal at 49%. So could you talk about what kept it low? And do you think that will rebound as we move into the third quarter?\nRick Hessling: Matt, it's Rick. So the yields were really an impact of the feedstock input. And I would tell you that the ultimate capture though was enabled by our ability to capture higher margin with our specific commodities. So it's again an a testament to the team working from cradle to grave to maximize the margin irrespective of the yield percentage.\nMatthew Blair: Sounds good. And then sticking with refining. When we look at octane spreads by region, the Midwest really stands out. We're seeing about $40 premiums versus regular gasoline compared to, say, the Gulf Coast around $9. Do you have a sense of what's driving those wide Midwest octane spreads? And is that something that you should be able to capture in your system?\nRick Hessling: Well, it's a great call out. This is Rick again. Yes, so the market is tight right now. There have been some notable disruptions in the Midwest that are straining supply and demand, Matt. And that's definitely been a benefit to us. While it has widen significantly as you've outlined. I would say we do expect a slight pullback to stay where it's at, probably is overly optimistic. But with that being said, constructively right now, the Midwest is tight.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: Just a quick follow-up on your midstream strategy as it complements R&M. So as you grow that wellhead-to-water footprint in Permian to the Texas Gulf Coast. Is your preference still to keep the commodity exposure at MPC such that if you get that final piece in market LPGs across the water, as your Midstream competitors do and R&M keeps that piece of the earnings. Could that structurally augment R&M capture?\nMaryann Mannen: Yes, Theresa, you're correct. We would keep that commodity risk as you well stated, at MPC. No desire to move that commodity risk. I'll pass it to Dave and allow him to give you a little more color there.\nDavid Heppner: Yes, Theresa, I think as we look at building out our wellhead-to-water strategies, one thought through it is from an MPLX lens and building that industry solution, both for MPC and other shippers on the system. And the second piece of the equation as we look at it from an enterprise perspective, where can we complement the MPC, MPLX relationship to create that incremental value. But also, as Maryann touched on, maintaining the commodity risk of that marketing and trading activity more on the MPC books. I hope that helps.\nMaryann Mannen: I think it's also the benefit of our integrated asset portfolio, I think you really see that come through.\nKristina Kazarian: All right, Sheila, if there are no other questions. Thank you for your interest in MPC. If you guys have additional questions or would like a clarification on the topics discussed this morning, please reach out and the Investor Relations team will be available to take your calls. Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Maryann. Slide 5 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2024 to second quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially by $133 million, driven by increased results in both our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segments. The tax rate for the quarter was 16%, resulting in a tax provision of $373 million. The second quarter tax rate largely reflects the earnings mix between our R&M and midstream businesses. Moving to our segment results. Slide 6 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the second quarter. Following significant turnaround activity in the first quarter, our refineries ran at 97% utilization, processing nearly 2.9 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs were $4.97 per barrel in the second quarter, lower, sequentially, primarily due to higher throughputs, lower project-related expenses associated with reduced turnaround activity and lower energy costs. In our largest region, the U.S. Gulf Coast, our operating costs were $3.73 per barrel, demonstrating our cost competitiveness. Sequentially, per barrel margins were down primarily due to lower crack spreads. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture of 94% for the quarter. Capture in the quarter reflected tailwinds from gasoline margins, offset by increased headwinds from secondary product pricing, which was driven by high refining industry utilization. Gasoline margins were supported by a falling price environment during the quarter and, in addition, our integrated system and realized demand across our multiple sales channels was a competitive differentiator to our capture performance. Slide 8 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2024. Our Midstream segment is generating strong cash flows. This quarter, MPLX distributions contributed $550 million in cash flow to MPC. The 2 midstream transactions Maryann discussed earlier further enhance our Permian value chains for both natural gas and NGLs. Through organic growth and disciplined investments, MPLX continues to provide growing cash flows to MPC. MPLX is a differentiator in the MPC portfolio and remains a source of durable earnings growth. Slide 9 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $2.7 billion in the quarter, driven by both our refining and midstream businesses. Working capital was a $541 million source of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by the decrease in refined product prices. This quarter, capital expenditures and investments were $541 million. And during the second quarter, MPLX issued $1.65 billion in tenured senior notes, the proceeds of which MPLX expects to use to retire senior notes maturing in December of this year and February of next year. MPC returned $2.9 billion through share repurchases and $290 million in dividends during the quarter. And in July, we repurchased just over $900 million of MPC shares, leaving $5.8 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations and highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $6 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, excluding cash at MPLX. Turning to guidance. On Slide 10, we provide our third quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of just over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing a utilization of 90%. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $330 million in the third quarter, with activity focused in the Mid-Con and Gulf Coast regions. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be approximately $1.4 billion. Operating costs are projected to be $5.35 per barrel in the third quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.55 billion and corporate costs are expected to be $200 million. In summary, our second quarter results reflect strong cash generation and disciplined capital allocation. The R&M segment generated $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA and MPLX distributed $550 million to MPC. This supported investments of over $500 million and capital return of approximately $3.2 billion. With that, let me pass it back to Maryann. Paul, it's John. On the other margin change you see for R&M, not all of it, but it primarily relates to us finalizing our insurance claim for the Galveston Bay reformer. So we would have finalized that, recognize that income in the first quarter and then receive the cash proceeds in Q2. So you have that recognition in Q1, but again, it's the final one. So there's really nothing to offset it in Q2. That's what's driving the change you're seeing there. John, it's John. I'll take that to start. You're spot on with the turnaround comment really largely what you're seeing, right, we've got activity, as I mentioned, in the Mid-Con and the Gulf Coast, that's going to affect what we're going to be able to run. And then I'll make an initial comment, turn it over to Rick if he has any further. But really, we're going to continue to run our assets optimally to meet the demand in the market."

            "content": "Yes, John, this is Tim. I'll take that one. We continue to believe Martinez is a highly competitive facility. And in the second quarter, we did bring a second unit back online, which did provide us with the ability to run at 75% of the nameplate capacity. And as we have noted in the past, we expect to bring the last production unit online by the end of this year, which would allow the plant to run at 100% of its nameplate capacity. So we're on track for that."

            "name": "Maryann Mannen",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. I want to take a moment to recognize Mike Hennigan's leadership as CEO of MPC over the last 4 years. Mike's record of accomplishment has been tremendously valuable. During his tenure, Mike delivered its transformative strategic priorities and returned a peer-leading $40 billion to shareholders. We're fortunate to have Mike as Executive Chairman of MPC's Board going forward. Moving to the global macro environment. In the second quarter, supply of refined products reached all-time seasonal highs. The margin environment supported assets running at high utilization and new capacity additions continue to ramp. At the same time, demand for refined products set new records globally. We expect 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption. Within MPC's domestic and export businesses, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline and diesel and growing demand for jet fuel. As we look forward, demand growth is expected to outpace near-term capacity additions over time with limited global refining capacity additions expected through the end of the decade. These fundamentals still support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining. The U.S. refining industry is expected to remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. We believe our assets will remain the most competitive in each region in which we operate. Our fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast regions provide us with a competitive advantage. We are steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees. Operational excellence and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, uniquely positioning us to capture market opportunities. Our execution remains core to our value delivery. Our disciplined capital investments are focused on high-return projects. In refining, we are making investments predominantly in our large competitively advantaged facilities to optimize our assets and position MPC well into the future. In midstream, MPLX continues to execute attractive growth opportunities focused on bringing in incremental third-party cash flows. We continue to grow our natural gas and NGL value chains. In the second quarter, MPLX closed the Whistler transaction. Last week, MPLX and its partners reached FID on the Blackcomb natural gas pipeline. It will be a 2.5 Bcf pipeline connecting supply in the Permian to domestic and export markets along the Gulf Coast. This project offers a compelling value proposition while providing shippers with flexible market access. Blackcomb is expected to be in service in the second half of 2026. Additionally, MPLX recently increased its ownership in BANGL. This pipeline transports NGLs from the Permian to Sweeny, Texas, and it is currently expanding its capacity to 250,000 barrels a day. This transaction is immediately accretive and enhances MPLX's Permian NGL value chain as part of its developing wellhead-to-water strategy. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio, providing a $2.2 billion annualized cash distribution to MPC. This fully covers MPC's dividend and nearly all of our 2024 capital program. And our Midstream segment, which is primarily comprised of MPLX, has grown its adjusted EBITDA at nearly 7% compound annual growth rate over the last 3 years. Strong coverage, low leverage and growing cash flows provide MPLX financial flexibility, placing it in an excellent position to continue to significantly grow its distributions, further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. MPLX -- sorry, MPC's total capital return since May 2021 has reduced MPC share count by nearly 50%. Cash generation will continue to influence buyback capacity as we return to a normalized balance sheet. Given our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.2 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we believe we can lead peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle. MPC generated second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $4.12. Our operational excellence and commercial performance support our quarterly results. This quarter, we delivered refining utilization at 97%, capture of 94%, up 2%, while other refining peers reported sequential declines. Adjusted R&M EBITDA per barrel of $7.07 and cash from operations, excluding the impacts of working capital of $2.7 billion, both of which led refining peers, and we returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders. The capabilities we have built provide a sustainable advantage, and we expect to continue to see the impact on our quarterly results. Let me turn the call over to John. Thanks, John. My priorities are consistent with those that made MPC a peer-leading energy investment. We are unwavering in our commitment to safe and reliable operations. Operational excellence, commercial execution and our cost competitiveness yield sustainable structural benefits and position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance irrespective of the market environment. To do this, we will optimize our portfolio to deliver outperformance now and in the future. We'll leverage our value chain advantages, ensure the competitiveness of our assets and continue to invest in our people. Our execution of these commitments position us to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash generation. Durable midstream growth should deliver cash flow uplift. We will invest capital but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness. We are committed to leading in capital allocation. We will return excess capital through share repurchases. MPC is positioned to create exceptional value through peer-leading performance, execution of our strategic commitments and a compelling value proposition. Let me turn the call back over to Kristina. Thanks, Manav. I think you said it well. The strategy that we are trying to execute in MPLX, we've talked about targeting mid-single-digit growth. As you've seen over the last 3 years, we've achieved that almost 8% in distributable cash flows as well. And to your point, we have increased the dividend over the last 3 years and more so in the last 2 years, 10% per year. We believe that our strategies, wellhead-to-water, as we explained, and the key initiatives that you just articulated for me, our investment in BANGL, our JV in the Utica, Whistler. And then also just recently, the FID of Blackcomb, we think, continue to support our ability to deliver in growing mid-single-digit growth. Therefore, our goal of increasing that distribution and bringing it back to MPC creates, we believe, incremental strategic value between MPC and MPLX. And as you stated well, that will fully cover the MPC dividend and largely the capital that heretofore MPC has been putting to work. So again, we think that strategic relationship becomes incredibly more important as we are able to increase MPLX's distribution going forward. Manav, thanks. So as you know, one of our key initiatives, one of our priorities with respect to our peer-leading initiatives has been profitability per barrel. And we see that as a cost competitive commitment, if you will, in each of the regions where we operate. As we've been talking about for the last few years, the work that we have been doing, we believe, is sustainable. Ultimately, again, what we're trying to do is to deliver the best EBITDA per barrel in each of those regions. We appreciate your recognition of the Gulf Coast. I'll pass it to Rick to see if he wants to add any comments on the Gulf Coast. Neil, thank you. I'll say, first and foremost, continuing to create exceptional value. As we've shared here and tried to articulate here this morning, we believe we can deliver the strongest EBITDA per barrel and cash flow per share. And we're going to continue to focus on notwithstanding our safe and reliable operations every day, all day, delivering outstanding operational excellence, commercial performance. We talked a little bit about that here that will be a focus as we go forward to ensure that our profitability per barrel is the strongest. Ultimately, at the end of the day, we want to have our peer-leading capital allocation, and we'll continue to drive all that we do to ensure that those allocation principles return on and return of are peer-leading. I shared a little bit. We're going to continue to do that, leveraging our value chain. We also want to ensure as we always have the competitive nature of those assets, it's something that we will continually evaluate. And then last, as we talk about one of the things that I just shared here is the durable midstream growth in our -- with the cash flows, we think that is another compelling value proposition for MPC. And with all that, we should be able to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash flow. I think those are the things that you will see me continue to focus on not only in the next 6 months, but continuously as we drive value for our shareholders. Yes. Sure, Neil. Let me address the Neste one, first. I heard you mention that. That rumor is not factual, and we are not having any conversations about a buyout with Neste. So just want to be sure that I address that. As we continue to look at the opportunities, we do see value within our portfolio. I mentioned the competitive nature of each of our regions. We continue to see opportunities there to drive performance. We are focused on our commercial performance and continuing to deliver the strongest EBIT per barrel, as I mentioned. So right now we see the opportunities within our own portfolio, and we'll continue to evaluate as we go forward over the long term how to deliver that value proposition. But we see our ability to grow organically. Paul, thank you. So on TMX, first and foremost, I think we've been talking about this for the last several quarters. And what I would share with you is the start-up of TMX has largely happened as we anticipated and the results of that very similar to the way that we believe that would play out in the marketplace. So pretty consistent as we've shared. I'm going to pass it to Rick and allow him to give you some incremental color in particular on what's happening in the West Coast. Sure, Roger, thanks. A couple of things I'd say. First and foremost, over the long haul, we continue to believe in an enhanced mid-cycle, it will continue in the U.S. Clearly, in the short term, we talked a little bit about what we saw happen in Q1, Q2. Q2 coming off of pretty high turnaround across the space on -- in Q1. And then you see, obviously, continued volatility here, supply demand. But over the long haul, as I mentioned, we do not see really any challenge there. There could be supply that comes online. But when you look at demand that we are expecting over the long term, we think that will be absorbed, clearly some short term. China, obviously, that in just recent reports there in terms of where their demands flow is decisions by OPEC, all of which we think could have some short-term volatility. But over the long term, enhanced mid-cycle, we believe, depending on how you think about that mid-cycle, one of the ways that we like to articulate, we're running 1 billion barrels. If you think it's a $1, it's an incremental $1 billion to the MPC portfolio, just a way for you to maybe frame that. I'll pass it to Rick and let him give you a little more color there. Jason, thanks. With respect to buyback, I appreciate the comment on the second quarter, you could see $2.9 billion in the quarter. We continue to see share buyback as an appropriate return of capital, particularly when you look at the current equity price of MPC and what we believe to be over the long term, the growth and opportunity in this equity. So you'll continue to see us use cash to buy back stock. Again, no change to that view as we look at that. Part of the reason you saw that change in net debt, obviously, is quarter-over-quarter. You saw the drawdown in cash. We've talked about what looks like a reasonable place for us to be in terms of the cash position. I can have John share a little bit more about that with you. But we're not near there. So we continue to believe in buybacks, and we'll go forward with that. Thanks for the question, Carlos. With respect to our dividend policy, no change in how we think about that. Some criteria. One, we want that dividend to have the ability to grow. And over the last few years, we look at that in the third quarter, and we'll do so again. But over the last few years, we've grown that dividend over a period of time, about 12.5% compound annual growth in the change of that dividend. We want that dividend to be sustainable and we want that dividend obviously to be competitive. So we'll take another look at that and share with you as we head into the third quarter as we have in prior years. We continue to believe that when we talk about return on capital, we're looking at both dividend and share repurchase, but that our share repurchase is the primary vehicle for us in the return of capital strategy. No, I don't think we would relever the balance sheet. We've talked about our strategy and structure as it relates to debt to cap. We'll continue to look at that, but don't see a reason at this point that we would relever the MPC balance sheet. Yes, Theresa, you're correct. We would keep that commodity risk as you well stated, at MPC. No desire to move that commodity risk. I'll pass it to Dave and allow him to give you a little more color there. I think it's also the benefit of our integrated asset portfolio, I think you really see that come through."

            "content": "Yes. So on the Gulf Coast, I will share that with utilization where it's at. We believe it to be a highly constructive market going forward and continue to rebound, Manav. Yes. Paul, it's Rick. Just a few comments here. Really, no surprises. I would tell you from a yield perspective, the changes are insignificant from our perspective. What has changed, though, that is significant and quite helpful to us, actually, is as these incremental Canadian barrels have come into the market, it has put pressure on the ANS barrel. And as you're well aware, we're a big buyer and runner of ANS barrels on the West Coast. So we're a recipient of that. So that's been very positive for us. And then obviously, with our commitment on TMX, we have the ability to run these advantaged barrels not only at Anacortes, but at LA. So it's been very positive for us, see it being that way going forward, Paul. And then in terms of the export comment to Asia, not surprising at all. In fact, we expect that plus or minus will continue. And Paul, that will largely be dependent on differentials and your quality differentials and your transportation, shipping transportation to the West Coast. So when you factor in those 2 variables, you'll be able to back into what will happen here going forward. Yes. Roger, just a few more comments. So when you look, S&D is really in line with our expectations. It's really what we -- what and where we thought it would be. But when you drill down even further and look at utilization closer to home domestically over the last couple of weeks, even domestic utilization is off some 4%, ironically, bringing us to this 90% utilization level, which is where our guidance is going forward. So we see that as continuing to be very constructive. And then I'll just spend a moment talking about our demand. Our demand within MPC, both domestically and from an export perspective is very steady on the gas and diesel side, and we're seeing really strong signals on the jet side. So we believe those tailwinds, combined with the supply and demand picture, that's truly in balance further backs up our mid-cycle plus thoughts going forward. Yes, John nailed it. We will run economically and 90% is the guidance that we think is a fair number going forward as we're 1/3 of the way through the quarter. Jason, it's Rick Hessling, so no onetime items. What I would tell you is we believe a competitive advantage of our assets in the Mid-Con is our fully integrated system. We've been working for many years to create optionality from what we call cradle to grave when you think refining all the way through our end consumer. And we believe this is and will continue to pull through on our results. Matt, it's Rick. So the yields were really an impact of the feedstock input. And I would tell you that the ultimate capture though was enabled by our ability to capture higher margin with our specific commodities. So it's again an a testament to the team working from cradle to grave to maximize the margin irrespective of the yield percentage. Well, it's a great call out. This is Rick again. Yes, so the market is tight right now. There have been some notable disruptions in the Midwest that are straining supply and demand, Matt. And that's definitely been a benefit to us. While it has widen significantly as you've outlined. I would say we do expect a slight pullback to stay where it's at, probably is overly optimistic. But with that being said, constructively right now, the Midwest is tight."

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin. \nKristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the investor tab. \n Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, President; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. \n We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. \n We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. \nMichael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Effective March 1, two new Independent Directors join the MPC Board. Eileen Drake and Kimberly Ellison-Taylor have strong records of accomplishment in complex industries making them outstanding additions, and we're happy to have them join our Board. \n As for the macro refining environment, we remain constructive in our view. Oil demand is at a record high globally, and we expect oil demand to continue to set records into the foreseeable future. Forecasted outlook for this year estimate 1.2 million to 2 million barrels per day of incremental demand over 2023, primarily driven by the growing need for transportation fuels. Within our own domestic and export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline and growth for diesel and jet fuel. And we continue to believe that 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption. \n Global supply remains constrained. Anticipated capacity additions have progressed more slowly than expected. And longer term, the level of announced capacity additions remains limited for the rest of the decade. In the first quarter, high global turnaround activity, the transition to summer gasoline blends, and light product inventories supported refining fundamentals, especially towards the end of the quarter. As we look forward, we believe these fundamentals will support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for the refining industry. \n We believe the U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. Our system has a locational advantage given the accessibility of nearby crude which we believe will grow as cost of transportation increases. The availability of low-cost natural gas, low-cost butane and our refining systems complexity all increase our competitive advantage over the international sources of supply. \n Even with this outlook, we remain focused on capital discipline while investing to grow earnings at strong returns. In the first quarter, we invested over $1.3 billion in capital expenditures. Investments and acquisitions comprised of attractive refining projects and Midstream investments, including MPLX's $625 million strategic acquisition in the Utica Basin. \n In Refining, we are investing predominantly at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. With a focus on safety and asset reliability, we successfully completed the largest amount of planned maintenance work in MPC's history. Four of our largest and most profitable refineries were in turnaround during the quarter, limiting our financial performance. These assets were in turnaround during a period of lower demand and now we're ready to meet the increased consumption that comes with the summer driving season. \n In Midstream, MPLX continues to execute on attractive growth opportunities. The Harmon Creek II gas processing plant was placed into service in late February, bringing MPLX's Marcellus processing capacity to 6.5 billion cubic feet per day. And in the Permian Basin, Preakness II is approaching startup and expected to be online by the end of May. We're also building our seventh gas processing plant in the basin, Secretariat, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, our total processing capacity in the Delaware Basin will be approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day, which would average to a pace of roughly one new plant per year since 2018. \n Additionally, MPLX announced two strategic transactions. First, in the Utica, MPLX enhanced its footprint through the acquisition of additional ownership interest in an existing joint venture and a dry gas gathering system. We've already seen growth in the rich gas window of the Utica and we see new producers moving into the region. \n Second, MPLX entered into a definitive agreement to combine the Whistler pipeline and Rio Bravo pipeline projects into a newly formed joint venture. The platform expands MPLX's natural gas value chain and positions MPLX for future growth opportunities. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio. Its current $2.2 billion annualized cash distribution MPC fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to continue to increase its cash distributions as it pursues growth opportunities, further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. \n Our overall capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend, and we intend to grow the company's earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. \n Beyond these three priorities, we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. Demonstrating this commitment, today, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization. Our total capital return through share repurchases and dividends since May of 2021 now totals $35 billion with MPC share count reduced by nearly 50%. \n Let me take a second to share our view on value. We continue to believe share repurchases make sense at the current share price level. When we purchased MPC stock, we are buying into a premier, highly advantaged refining system. We're also buying into a growing Midstream business via our ownership at MPLX. \n And finally, we are buying strong business execution, disciplined investment and a commitment to capital returns, which will continue to position MPC as an excellent investment. \n At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann. \nMaryann Mannen: Thank you, Mike. Our team's operational and commercial execution supported our ability to generate earnings per share of $2.58 for the quarter and $3.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, while having four of our largest refineries in turnaround. This quarter, in conjunction with the planned turnaround activity, we took the opportunity to execute incremental, smaller, high-return, quick-hit projects focused on optimization and reliability initiatives. This planned maintenance activity contributed to a reduction in refinery throughput of nearly 270,000 barrels per day or 9% compared with the fourth quarter. We plan this turnaround activity to occur in the first quarter with a focus on safety and asset integrity and in a period of seasonally weaker demand. \n Now with a large portion of our 2024 activity complete, we are well positioned to run our refining system near full utilization through the summer driving season. \n Capture in the quarter was 92% and reflects the seasonal market backdrop. Light product margins were weaker and product inventory builds were both headwinds to quarterly results. Our commitment to commercial excellence remains foundational. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years provide a sustainable advantage versus our peers, and we expect to continue to see the impact in our quarterly results. \n We are successfully progressing our 2024 capital investment plan. This includes executing on a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery and construction of a distillate hydrotreater at our Galveston Bay refinery, both expected to yield returns of approximately 20% or more. \n In addition to these large projects, we continue to execute on smaller, high-return, quick-hit projects targeted at enhancing refinery yields, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost. \n Let me turn the call over to John. \nJohn Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2023 to first quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $300 million, driven primarily by heavy planned turnaround activity, resulting in lower R&M throughputs. \n To assist with your analysis, we thought it helpful to note the company recorded an $89 million or $0.20 per share charge resulting from the quarterly fair value remeasurement of certain long-term incentive compensation. Aligned with shareholder value creation, the charge was driven by the $53 or 36% increase in our share price as well as our total shareholder return performance versus our peers during the quarter. Again, this charge, which we did not adjust for, reduced earnings by $0.20 per share. \n The tax rate for the quarter was 18%, resulting in a tax provision of $293 million. While this rate is lower than what we'd expect to receive for the year, it reflects the permanent tax benefits of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in MPLX as well as a discrete benefit related to equity compensation realized in the quarter. \n Moving to our segment results, Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the first quarter. Our Refining & Marketing results reflect lower throughputs associated with planned turnaround activity as our refineries ran at 82% utilization processing over 2.4 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs were $6.14 per barrel in the first quarter. Higher sequentially, primarily due to the lower throughputs. Sequentially, per barrel margins were up slightly as higher crack spreads were offset by lower margin capture. \n Slide 9 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment is growing and generating strong cash flows. In this quarter, MPLX's distribution contributed $550 million in cash flow to MPC. As Mike said, MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and is a differentiator for us. \n Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was over $1.9 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining & Midstream businesses. Working capital was a $389 million use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by minor builds in crude and refined product inventories mainly related to the turnaround activity. This quarter, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions were $1.3 billion, including $710 million of growth and maintenance capital and $622 million for MPLX acquisitions net of cash received. Highlighting our steadfast commitment to superior shareholder returns, MPC returned $2.5 billion via repurchases and dividends during the quarter. \n As Mike commented, earlier today, we announced the approval of an additional $5 billion for share repurchases and as of April 26, we have $8.8 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations. And from May of 2021 through April 26 of this year, we have repurchased 312 million shares or 48% of the shares that were outstanding in May of 2021. At the end of the first quarter, MPC had approximately $7.6 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, which includes $385 million of MPLX cash. \n Turning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our second quarter outlook. With our significant first quarter turnaround activity behind us, we are projecting higher throughput volumes of nearly 2.8 million barrels per day representing utilization of 94%. Planned turnaround expense is expected to be approximately $200 million in the second quarter, with activity primarily in the Mid-Con region. \n Operating costs are projected to be $4.95 per barrel in the second quarter, much lower than the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of running our system near full utilization and lower expected operating costs. For the full year, we expect operating cost per barrel to trend towards a more normalized level of $5 per barrel subject to energy cost volatility. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion for the second quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $200 million. \n With that, let me pass it back to Mike. \nMichael Hennigan: In summary, our unwavering commitment to safety, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement positions us well. We will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets. We will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. The enhanced mid-cycle environment should continue longer term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. \n MPLX remains a source of growth and a unique competitive advantage in our portfolio. We believe it will continue to grow its cash distributions to cover both MPC's dividend and capital requirements and still generate excess cash before the first dollar of refining EBITDA is earned. \n Another way to frame it, MPC has reduced its share count from approximately 650 million in May of 2021, down to approximately 355 million at the end of the first quarter. Over this same time frame, the MPLX units owned by MPC has held roughly flat at approximately 650 million units. So the ratio of MPLX units held by MPC to our outstanding shares or the potential value to MPC on a per share basis from MPLX has nearly doubled. \n The Midstream business, which continues to grow, provides a unique value proposition for MPC shareholders. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice, with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior returns supported by our steadfast commitment to return capital. \n Consistent with our goal to have the strongest through-cycle cash generation, even with four of our most profitable refineries in turnaround adjusted on a comparable basis, we still generated more cash from operations than our refining peers. Very proud of the team's accomplishments. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Kristina. \nKristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call up for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we'll reprompt for additional questions. \n With that, operator, we're ready. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. \nNeil Mehta: I had two questions. The first one, more of an industry one, which is your perspective on the West Coast, we've seen as [ Rodeo ] has shut down in Martinez, West Coast margins have really strengthened here, particularly for gasoline. So what's your outlook as we go into the summer and your thoughts on doing business in California, broadly? \nMichael Hennigan: Neil, I'll let Rick start off with that one. \nRick Hessling: The market really in California is fundamentally short and it's long diesel. That's kind of the thesis as we look out there. And an example of that is if you look at gasoline inventories, especially right now, they're tight. \n In fact, they're below the 5-year average and we're seeing solid demand across the integrated system. So I generally would say that's the reasoning for the scenario right now, and I just want to reiterate the market is short gasoline. And so this is an environment that we expect may persist through summer, and we'll see where it goes from there. \nNeil Mehta: And then the follow-up is just on the return of capital cadence. The buyback this quarter, the $2.2 billion was a little bit lighter than what I think many on the street were modeling. Just any thoughts on what, was that a reflection of some of the onetime working capital and M&A dynamics or valuation sensitivity? And how should we think about that over the course of the year? \nMichael Hennigan: Yes. Neil, this is Mike. Thanks for that question. There is no change in our commitment to returning capital, evidenced by the fact that we got the board to authorize another $5 billion. So what I would say to you is, don't read into the quarter-by-quarter variability. \n To your point, it could have been a little bit higher, but there's a lot of factors that are influencing the activity within the quarter. So the takeaway should be, we are committed and that hasn't changed. We believe in returning capital to shareholders. You're going to continue to see us do that. \nOperator: Next, we will hear from Manav Gupta with UBS. \nManav Gupta: Guys, in your introductory comments, you did mention that some global capacity was supposed to come on. It's challenge, it's not really come on, I'm trying to understand here, once we go past 2024, like 2025, there's limited capacity expansions that we are aware of. And at this point, I think we understand that 2024 will be above mid-cycle. But based on your commentary, would it be fair to say even Rodeo shutdown and other Houston refinery shutting down, you could well see 2025 also as a year where cracks are well above the mid-cycle levels. \nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Manav, I think you've said it very well. I'll let Rick add some comments. But in general, like we said in our prepared remarks, global supply is constrained. And we are a believer that demand will continue to set records year after year throughout the rest of the decade. So we're very bullish demand with a constrained supply scenario leads us to situation that we have in the market today. We don't see it changing based on everything that we know is available to us, and that's why we have that view. But I'll let Rick add some color. \nRick Hessling: So I will echo Mike's comments and share what you know and what you're reading is what we're seeing and hearing in the marketplace as well that the expansions appear to be continuously delayed. And with that, Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we see demand growing by 1.2 to upwards to 2 million barrels a day. So pick a number even in between there and that exceeds Manav, the expansions that may come online, end of year, this year or sometime in 2025. So even with those expansions coming online, we see demand outpacing those expansions and thus, why we're so optimistic on this mid-cycle plus environment lasting. \nMichael Hennigan: And Manav, let me also add that historically, the demand numbers continue to get revised up. I know everybody's real time in their thought process, but it's also good to look back no matter which agency is doing. In fact, the U.S. agency, when they put the monthlies out, have continually for a long period of time, been underestimating gasoline and diesel demand. So it's just another factor that should put on people's radar to really look at all the revisions that have occurred because the demand numbers have been stronger, once they get fully corrected, embedded, then they are sometimes in the real-time disclosures. \nManav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up here is, I don't think I remember any time when I've seen a $650 million turnaround expense in a single quarter. So this quarter was truly exceptional in the amount of downtime you took. \n Now we look at second quarter guidance, it's meaningfully up. But if you look at the rest of the year, should we imagine that 1Q truly was exceptional because if you're going to run harder for the rest of the year, that would mean better capture, lower OpEx per barrel, but it would also translate to higher G&P earnings when you translate into the MPLX side. \nMaryann Mannen: It's Maryann. Let me start. So you're absolutely right. We tried to share, as we were on our call last quarter that we expected to have really the largest turnaround in MPC's history in the first quarter, and we did. We had four of our largest assets in turnaround. We think that's important as you well stated, given getting that work done ahead of summer driving season, we think we are well poised for that. \n You may comment also about the utilization. As you can see from our guidance, utilization is up. OpEx per barrel similarly, when you look quarter-over-quarter, the throughput impacted by the turnaround was certainly a driver. Sequentially, we're down OpEx. And you can see from what we guided in the second quarter as well that OpEx per barrel is actually well below what we printed for the first quarter.\n So I think you said it well. We took the opportunity in the quarter while we had the downtime at those largest plants, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to work on some projects at those same refineries, those same assets that we think will add reliability in the future as well. Hope that answers your question. \nJohn Quaid: Yes. And Manav, it's John. Just to build on what Maryann is saying to connect some dots as well. Those additional projects that we took the time to do, right? You can see some of that turnaround, some of that on OpEx but really, we felt like given the window we had and getting ready for the rest of the year, that was the right thing to do. Sorry, I just wanted to add that. \nManav Gupta: And just to quickly follow up, like the higher throughput also results in higher MPLX earnings for the next quarter, right? \nJohn Quaid: Yes. Manav, it's John. And I'm not sure this question came up on the MPLX call as well, but I know a little bit about it from my prior role. Remember, there's maybe less sensitivity on the L&S side of that business as refinery utilization moves higher and lower, just given the contractual structure of those contracts. So while there is some sensitivity, it may not be as much as you might be thinking. \nMichael Hennigan: Manav, it's Mike. I just want to add. I think the takeaway is, as Maryann said is, we chose to use the first quarter to take down four of our most profitable refineries. It's a lower demand period in the U.S., et cetera. And our thought process there was spend that money, increase the reliability, get ourselves ready so that we're able to perform in the second and third quarters as we progress out the year. So we think we've positioned ourselves very well despite a heavy spend in the quarter. We're happy that we've done it. We think the assets are in really good shape, and we're looking forward to the rest of the year. \nOperator: Next, we will hear from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. \nPaul Cheng: I guess that maybe different answer. If we look at comparing to your guidance from last quarter, your throughput is lower, OpEx and turnaround expenses are higher than the guidance. Is it all contributed by what you characterized that some of these quick-hit projects that is not originally in the guidance or that something else has contributed that? That's the first question. \nMaryann Mannen: It's Maryann. So yes, I think you characterized it well. We took the opportunity while those assets were down in turnaround to work on a few projects, frankly, wanted each of them that we felt would improve reliability going forward. When you talk about the guidance, throughput, as you said, slightly below that, that we guided, which contributed to the OpEx per barrel number that you saw slightly higher than what we guided. \n But in general, as you are -- as we're in turnaround and we look at the activity there, we took the opportunity to do what we needed to do to ensure safe reliable operations. And as Mike has already said, given us the opportunity to run hard as we look at the driving season ahead and increase performance. \nPaul Cheng: Okay. The second question is that, maybe this is for Rich. With the TMX part, how that will impact your West Coast operation, will you be able to fully replace the heavy oil and the medium sour that you're currently running over there by the WCS or that will have some kind of configuration limitation because the WCS consists mostly near the bitumen and a lot of condensate but don't have the [ metal ]. \nRick Hessling: Yes, Paul. Thank you for the question. So on the West Coast specifically, let me maybe back up and share what is public. We do have a TMX commitment on the line and we believe we will be a significant beneficiary because we will receive incremental Canadian advantaged crude not only into Paul, our Pacific Northwest system, but also our West Coast system. \n And specifically to your question, we'll end up, I believe, having a significant amount of opportunities on the spot market within the Westridge dock, to take potentially barrels to L.A. And because of sulfur limitations, because the majority of people out in the West Coast, I believe, as you know, are running ANS, we believe you'll see somewhat of a dumbbell type blending system where you'll take heavy Canadian with a lighter grade and introduce it into the units out there. But the net-net for us is we believe it will be quite positive for us, not only at Anacortes, our Pacific Northwest refinery but also at L.A. \nPaul Cheng: [ Rich ] can you share that how much WCS you think you may be able to run? \nRick Hessling: Right now, Paul, that's an unknown. We're continuing to look at the system and we'll look at the economics. So that will vary from month to month. \nOperator: Next, we'll hear from John Royall with JPMorgan. \nJohn Royall: So my question is a follow-up on capital allocation. You drew cash by about $2 billion at the parent level in 1Q, you now sit at about $7 billion in parent cash. So we're slowly getting closer to the $1 billion minimum cash balance, and I know we aren't there yet, but can you talk about how we should think about the buyback once you get to your minimum cash balance? Should we expect something like 100% of free cash flow paid out given you won't be supplementing with the balance sheet anymore? Just any color on what kind of normal could look like after you've drawn down your cash would be helpful. \nMichael Hennigan: Yes, John, this is Mike. I'll start off by saying we've been fortunate enough to continue to generate cash. That's been a good story for us. Back to Neil's first question, we want to make sure there's no ambiguity. We're committed to returning capital. \n One of the questions that Neil asked was is it a little lower in the quarter? And I tried to explain to not read into that quarter-to-quarter variability because a lot of factors that impact that. So I think the biggest takeaway is we're huge believers in returning capital to shareholders. And depending on the market conditions, et cetera, we evaluate it at every single quarter. And we try and put a program in place that prioritizes that.\n At the same time, we're also looking at where should we invest. You heard Maryann just talk about, we decided to spend a little bit more money in the first quarter to enhance the reliability of our assets. That's a good decision on our part. It's the first decision in our capital framework. But going forward, I think the big takeaway is you'll continue to see us be a leader in returning capital to shareholders. That's something we believe in. \n You'll see us be a leader in generating cash among our peers. As I said in my prepared remarks, very happy despite the situation we were in the first quarter with four of our largest, most profitable assets down, we still generated more cash than our peers. So we think that was a good accomplishment. \n And over time, you're going to see that we'll remain committed to our capital framework, of which -- when will we get to that $1 billion? That's a good question. I don't know that I can predict it depending on how the market treats us. But I think the biggest takeaway is we're committed to returning capital. And as long as we continue to generate cash, we'll continue to do that and reduce the share count going forward. \nJohn Royall: And then so my follow-up is just on long-term captures. I don't think you're officially calling 100% your long-term capture, but that's certainly where the business has trended. And you talked a lot about of sources of improvements to date. \n My question is, what are the key drivers going forward of driving that capture from 100% to something like 105% or something larger on a sustainable basis. Are there more singles and doubles you can hit on the commercial side? Is it some of the capital projects you're working at the refineries? I'm just trying to get a sense for where we should be looking for the next wave of improvements on the capture side. \nMaryann Mannen: John, it's Maryann and thanks for the question. As we've been sharing, our commercial performance remains foundational. You heard us talk about last quarter some changes that we made in the organization to continue to focus on value chain optimization. That's clearly an objective that Mike has for the organization. \n We're not done, we think a lot of the things that we have put in place are sustainable, but we do believe there's opportunities going forward. We like to say that we're approaching 100% over a longer period of time, as you've seen, we did it last year. And as you know, there were things from the market that we can't control. You look at our performance this quarter, as you know, we had weaker light product margins, as I shared. \n And obviously, the commercial team took some decisions pretty late in the quarter on product inventory build as well. But we will continue to focus on the things that we can, and we do believe there are opportunities that will allow us to continue to improve commercial performance. But we say we're approaching 100%, and we hope you've seen us use that as a deliverable going forward. Ultimately, at the end of the day, as Mike has shared with you, our objective is to deliver the strongest EBITDA per barrel and cash generation relative to our peers, and that remains a key focus when we look at our capture performance. \nMichael Hennigan: Yes, John, I can't help myself to jump in here. I know this capture metric gets a lot of discussion. And Kristina has been steadfast that we need to report on it. I just want to caution, as I always do, that there's a lot of factors, market factors, et cetera, that hit on that. The market should know we're committed to improving our commercial performance. That's obviously a goal here. But the metric that I want is to look at the most is cash. \n At the end of the day, go to the bottom of the sheet as opposed to all the very different variables throughout it. The most important thing is are we generating the most cash. So that's the metric that I start with as we analyze the performance of the assets, et cetera. So I just want to reiterate that. I know a lot of people like to talk capture, it's not the one that I think tells the story of the business that much. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. \nJason Gabelman: I wanted to first ask about the Martinez biofuel projects. It looks like the other income line was close to -- in Refining was close to $200 million this quarter. I think that includes the impact from Martinez. So I was hoping to get an idea of how much that contributed to earnings this quarter and then how you think about the ramp-up in capacity to 100% from current 50%? \nJohn Quaid: Great. Jason, it's John. Let me take the first part of that, and then I'll turn it over to Maryann. But just to clarify, that other that you're seeing on the R&M walk, it is not related to Martinez. Largely, what you're seeing there are, and you've seen it in prior quarters are some of the insurance proceeds we've recognized in regards to a claim we had at some of our refineries. But I'll turn it over to Maryann to talk about Martinez, but I want to clarify, it's not in that bar. \nMaryann Mannen: Jason, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. So let me give you an update on Martinez. As you stated, we are currently operating at about 50% of our nameplate capacity. In November, we had a heater tube failure at Martinez and as I shared with you last quarter, we continue to work with all the regulators to align on what repairs are necessary and ensure a safer level operation going forward. \n We would expect to continue to operate at 50% for the second quarter. And then somewhere mid-third quarter, we would expect to see our capacity increase to about 75% of that nameplate. And again, when I talk about nameplate, I'm talking about 48,000 barrels a day, by the way, just for clarity. And then we do expect to ramp up to full capacity on Martinez by year-end. So again, 50% second quarter ramping to 75% mid-third quarter with full rate capacity by year-end. \nJason Gabelman: Got it. And that means, I guess, you got approval for the fixes that you need to make in the unit. And then is there any cost OpEx associated with the improvements you need to make at the plant? \nMaryann Mannen: So in our second quarter guidance, we do not have any cost yet included in that second quarter. Yes, we continue to work with regulators to align on the path forward. So we believe, again, continue to work with them, but we believe we understand the work that needs to be done, and we are aligning with our regulators to achieve that. \nJason Gabelman: Great. And then my other question is -- sorry, Mike, I'm going to go back to this capture metric. And you include just $392 million headwind on Slide 8 of capture impact. Some of that is from product inventory and derivatives. I'm wondering if that amount, if you could share what that is and if that reverses in 2Q. \nMaryann Mannen: It's Maryann. So you'll notice that we try to give you on that slide, we show you the impact that is from crude and the impact from product. And what you saw this quarter is what was normally a very positive impact from product margins really narrowed quite a bit in the first quarter. \n Alternatively, that crude is typically a key driver. It always pulls capture, and that will ebb and flow just depending on a series of things. But the key driver in this first quarter as you see were product margins, and the inventories, right? We made some commercial decisions, which we think were the right ones, and we made those decisions sort of late in the quarter. But as those market dynamics change, we'll be able to share that with you going forward. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. \nRoger Read: I guess I'd like to dig into here maybe your expectations on crude as we've heard from some of the other companies, what's going on in terms of available barrels out there and you've talked a little bit about the positives on the West Coast. But how should we think about the impact in the Mid-Con down to the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con, thinking the WCS going west instead of south and then along the Gulf Coast, just what you're seeing in terms of available barrel on the heavy-medium to heavy side and thoughts on the light heavy spreads. \nRick Hessling: Roger, it's Rick. So I'll start with light-heavy spreads. We continue to see them right about where they're at today. Obviously, we've seen the WCS spread come in a few bucks. And ironically, if you look out on the forward curve towards the end of this year, it actually starts to move back out $2 to $3 due to strong Canadian production and diluent blending. So we see this as a little bit of a near-term blip.\n Specifically in the Mid-Con, I do believe there is a misconception that the Mid-Con will be [ short and heavy ]. We don't believe that to be the case. As you know, we're a big buyer in the Mid-Con. And when we look at TMX coming online, we believe the marginal Canadian barrel that's going to get backed out of the system first is the U.S. Gulf Coast export barrel. And so with that being said, when we're looking forward here, whether it's PADD 2, 3 or 5, we expect to generally run about the same mix of Canadian barrels that we've run here in the past several quarters. \nRoger Read: Yes, that makes sense. And I guess if we do see fewer barrels on the Gulf Coast, Canadian or otherwise, what's your anticipation there relative to what you've been running at either Galveston Bay or Garyville? \nRick Hessling: Yes. We don't see it changing a lot. I will tell you, when we look at Brazilian growth, when we look at [ Guyana ] production, and then Canadian even with some barrels getting backed out. We don't see our mix changing that much, Roger. And then we certainly have barrels that could potentially come from the Middle East if we get the right economic signals. So I would say, all in, I really don't expect a significant change. \nRoger Read: One final clarification on the West Coast. We've heard some say that the acidity of the WCS barrel could be a headwind for running some. And I think when people ask about your ability to run max barrels of WCS, maybe that's what they're getting at. Is there any limitation from a metallurgic kind of physical capacity issue for you on the West Coast? \nRick Hessling: It is something that will balance, Roger. I believe I said earlier, ANS, the biggest difference is ANS. It has about 5x lower sulfur than WCS. So that's why we believe there will be a lot of blending going on, on the West Coast. But I do believe, in general, you will see it limit other's toolkits on what the amount is that they can run but we've yet to see -- we need to see that play out. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with TPH. \nMatthew Blair: We're seeing octane spreads at record levels. Is that a function of the Tier 3 low sulfur gasoline specs and perhaps any dynamics in the NAFTA market. Could you talk about the drivers here? And how much of MPC's gasoline production is high octane? \nRick Hessling: Yes, Matt, it's Rick again. So I will tell you, good call out. We're seeing octane values being extremely high. And as you know, we have a lot of reforming capacity. So we are a large octane producer, so we're seeing the benefit. Certainly, you hit on a couple of the reasons. Specs is certainly a region. But I will also tell you, we're seeing strong signals on the export side.\n And when you think about the export market, we're sending over volume there that generally does not have ethanol in it. So that is eating up a lot of octane [ long ] product. And then there is persistent length from the NAFTA market due to poor petchem margins. So that's helping us out on the octane side. \n And then lastly, more recently here, you're certainly seeing the impact of high turnarounds, just taking octane off the market here in Q1, and it's carrying into Q2, and we see it persisting for a while, Matt. \nMatthew Blair: Sounds good. And then circling back to an earlier question, I think you mentioned you were long diesel in California. Is that a function of RD share approaching 60% or so? And if so, what do you do with those extra diesel barrels? Are they exported to like Mexico or Canada or Asia? \nRick Hessling: Yes. So great comment. And my comment earlier, the industry, I would say, is long diesel, and we're not alone in that category, we are as well. And you're right, we've got to find export opportunities, Matt, whether anything waterborne where we can find a home to clear the product is what we and others are doing. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. \nTheresa Chen: When we think about your marketing margins within R&M, the direction of wholesale gasoline prices benefiting Q4 as they came off and then acting as a headwind in Q1 as prices shot up, how can that move the broader R&M capture quarter-to-quarter or the cash generation from the segment and how should we think about the [indiscernible] into second quarter? \nRick Hessling: Theresa, can you restate the back half of your question, I'm not sure I caught that part, please. This is Rick. \nTheresa Chen: Sure, Rick. Related to your marketing margins and the move of the flat wholesale [ gasoline ] prices benefiting Q4 as prices declined and then acting as a headwind as they came up on how much is that can really bring noise to the R&M capture quarter-to-quarter? \nRick Hessling: Yes, good question. So it can be significant. And depending on the region it's just tough, as you pointed out, in an upward market. If you look at Q1 to your point, Theresa, I think we had a $14 flat price increase throughout the quarter. So it definitely was a headwind, and it can be significant. We, amongst all of our competitors need to be competitive at our racks and in an up market, it continues to be a headwind. So I don't have a specific number that I can share with you. but it's definitely a factor in our capture. \nTheresa Chen: Got it. And Mike, going to your earlier comments about MPLX as a strategic investment and with the announcement at the partnership over the past few months and just migration of more and more third-party cash flows, do you have a long-term target for the breakdown of third party to [ GP ] driven EBITDA cash flows over time? And would a shift towards more third-party cash flows help MPC possibly have more flexibility in the upcoming contracting events to take place over the next few years? \nMichael Hennigan: Yes, Theresa, we don't have a target per se using that term. We do have a goal of generating increasing cash flows from third parties as well as optimizing within our own system as well. The point I was trying to make is where we stand today, that distribution from MPLX covers the MPC dividend and more than half of the capital. \n But going out, and again, this isn't guidance, but if you look at the trend, we're going to continue to increase the MPLX distribution over time. And as you see that occurring and depending on the capital needs at the refining side of the business, the statement I said was there'll be a point where MPLX's distribution will cover the dividend and all of the capital and still have excess cash. That's how unique the competitive advantages of that business. \n And we've been bullish natural gas growth for a long time. And I always caution, I'm not saying natural gas price, I'm saying natural gas growth volume. We continue to believe that, that has tailwinds behind it whether it's all the topics that have been talked about recently. But as that continues to occur, that ability for MPLX cash generation increase will just continue, and it will get to a point where it's covering the dividend at MPC, the capital at MPC and still generate excess cash. That's where we're headed. So I don't know that we have a target other than that target, and we'll try and keep growing that. \nKristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you so much for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, please reach out and the IR team will be available to help with your call today. Thank you for joining us. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you once again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Maryann Mannen",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Our team's operational and commercial execution supported our ability to generate earnings per share of $2.58 for the quarter and $3.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, while having four of our largest refineries in turnaround. This quarter, in conjunction with the planned turnaround activity, we took the opportunity to execute incremental, smaller, high-return, quick-hit projects focused on optimization and reliability initiatives. This planned maintenance activity contributed to a reduction in refinery throughput of nearly 270,000 barrels per day or 9% compared with the fourth quarter. We plan this turnaround activity to occur in the first quarter with a focus on safety and asset integrity and in a period of seasonally weaker demand. \n Now with a large portion of our 2024 activity complete, we are well positioned to run our refining system near full utilization through the summer driving season. \n Capture in the quarter was 92% and reflects the seasonal market backdrop. Light product margins were weaker and product inventory builds were both headwinds to quarterly results. Our commitment to commercial excellence remains foundational. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years provide a sustainable advantage versus our peers, and we expect to continue to see the impact in our quarterly results. \n We are successfully progressing our 2024 capital investment plan. This includes executing on a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery and construction of a distillate hydrotreater at our Galveston Bay refinery, both expected to yield returns of approximately 20% or more. \n In addition to these large projects, we continue to execute on smaller, high-return, quick-hit projects targeted at enhancing refinery yields, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost. \n Let me turn the call over to John. It's Maryann. Let me start. So you're absolutely right. We tried to share, as we were on our call last quarter that we expected to have really the largest turnaround in MPC's history in the first quarter, and we did. We had four of our largest assets in turnaround. We think that's important as you well stated, given getting that work done ahead of summer driving season, we think we are well poised for that. \n You may comment also about the utilization. As you can see from our guidance, utilization is up. OpEx per barrel similarly, when you look quarter-over-quarter, the throughput impacted by the turnaround was certainly a driver. Sequentially, we're down OpEx. And you can see from what we guided in the second quarter as well that OpEx per barrel is actually well below what we printed for the first quarter.\n So I think you said it well. We took the opportunity in the quarter while we had the downtime at those largest plants, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to work on some projects at those same refineries, those same assets that we think will add reliability in the future as well. Hope that answers your question. It's Maryann. So yes, I think you characterized it well. We took the opportunity while those assets were down in turnaround to work on a few projects, frankly, wanted each of them that we felt would improve reliability going forward. When you talk about the guidance, throughput, as you said, slightly below that, that we guided, which contributed to the OpEx per barrel number that you saw slightly higher than what we guided. \n But in general, as you are -- as we're in turnaround and we look at the activity there, we took the opportunity to do what we needed to do to ensure safe reliable operations. And as Mike has already said, given us the opportunity to run hard as we look at the driving season ahead and increase performance. John, it's Maryann and thanks for the question. As we've been sharing, our commercial performance remains foundational. You heard us talk about last quarter some changes that we made in the organization to continue to focus on value chain optimization. That's clearly an objective that Mike has for the organization. \n We're not done, we think a lot of the things that we have put in place are sustainable, but we do believe there's opportunities going forward. We like to say that we're approaching 100% over a longer period of time, as you've seen, we did it last year. And as you know, there were things from the market that we can't control. You look at our performance this quarter, as you know, we had weaker light product margins, as I shared. \n And obviously, the commercial team took some decisions pretty late in the quarter on product inventory build as well. But we will continue to focus on the things that we can, and we do believe there are opportunities that will allow us to continue to improve commercial performance. But we say we're approaching 100%, and we hope you've seen us use that as a deliverable going forward. Ultimately, at the end of the day, as Mike has shared with you, our objective is to deliver the strongest EBITDA per barrel and cash generation relative to our peers, and that remains a key focus when we look at our capture performance. Jason, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. So let me give you an update on Martinez. As you stated, we are currently operating at about 50% of our nameplate capacity. In November, we had a heater tube failure at Martinez and as I shared with you last quarter, we continue to work with all the regulators to align on what repairs are necessary and ensure a safer level operation going forward. \n We would expect to continue to operate at 50% for the second quarter. And then somewhere mid-third quarter, we would expect to see our capacity increase to about 75% of that nameplate. And again, when I talk about nameplate, I'm talking about 48,000 barrels a day, by the way, just for clarity. And then we do expect to ramp up to full capacity on Martinez by year-end. So again, 50% second quarter ramping to 75% mid-third quarter with full rate capacity by year-end. So in our second quarter guidance, we do not have any cost yet included in that second quarter. Yes, we continue to work with regulators to align on the path forward. So we believe, again, continue to work with them, but we believe we understand the work that needs to be done, and we are aligning with our regulators to achieve that. It's Maryann. So you'll notice that we try to give you on that slide, we show you the impact that is from crude and the impact from product. And what you saw this quarter is what was normally a very positive impact from product margins really narrowed quite a bit in the first quarter. \n Alternatively, that crude is typically a key driver. It always pulls capture, and that will ebb and flow just depending on a series of things. But the key driver in this first quarter as you see were product margins, and the inventories, right? We made some commercial decisions, which we think were the right ones, and we made those decisions sort of late in the quarter. But as those market dynamics change, we'll be able to share that with you going forward."

            "name": "Rick Hessling",
            "content": "The market really in California is fundamentally short and it's long diesel. That's kind of the thesis as we look out there. And an example of that is if you look at gasoline inventories, especially right now, they're tight. \n In fact, they're below the 5-year average and we're seeing solid demand across the integrated system. So I generally would say that's the reasoning for the scenario right now, and I just want to reiterate the market is short gasoline. And so this is an environment that we expect may persist through summer, and we'll see where it goes from there. So I will echo Mike's comments and share what you know and what you're reading is what we're seeing and hearing in the marketplace as well that the expansions appear to be continuously delayed. And with that, Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we see demand growing by 1.2 to upwards to 2 million barrels a day. So pick a number even in between there and that exceeds Manav, the expansions that may come online, end of year, this year or sometime in 2025. So even with those expansions coming online, we see demand outpacing those expansions and thus, why we're so optimistic on this mid-cycle plus environment lasting. Yes, Paul. Thank you for the question. So on the West Coast specifically, let me maybe back up and share what is public. We do have a TMX commitment on the line and we believe we will be a significant beneficiary because we will receive incremental Canadian advantaged crude not only into Paul, our Pacific Northwest system, but also our West Coast system. \n And specifically to your question, we'll end up, I believe, having a significant amount of opportunities on the spot market within the Westridge dock, to take potentially barrels to L.A. And because of sulfur limitations, because the majority of people out in the West Coast, I believe, as you know, are running ANS, we believe you'll see somewhat of a dumbbell type blending system where you'll take heavy Canadian with a lighter grade and introduce it into the units out there. But the net-net for us is we believe it will be quite positive for us, not only at Anacortes, our Pacific Northwest refinery but also at L.A. Right now, Paul, that's an unknown. We're continuing to look at the system and we'll look at the economics. So that will vary from month to month. Roger, it's Rick. So I'll start with light-heavy spreads. We continue to see them right about where they're at today. Obviously, we've seen the WCS spread come in a few bucks. And ironically, if you look out on the forward curve towards the end of this year, it actually starts to move back out $2 to $3 due to strong Canadian production and diluent blending. So we see this as a little bit of a near-term blip.\n Specifically in the Mid-Con, I do believe there is a misconception that the Mid-Con will be [ short and heavy ]. We don't believe that to be the case. As you know, we're a big buyer in the Mid-Con. And when we look at TMX coming online, we believe the marginal Canadian barrel that's going to get backed out of the system first is the U.S. Gulf Coast export barrel. And so with that being said, when we're looking forward here, whether it's PADD 2, 3 or 5, we expect to generally run about the same mix of Canadian barrels that we've run here in the past several quarters. Yes. We don't see it changing a lot. I will tell you, when we look at Brazilian growth, when we look at [ Guyana ] production, and then Canadian even with some barrels getting backed out. We don't see our mix changing that much, Roger. And then we certainly have barrels that could potentially come from the Middle East if we get the right economic signals. So I would say, all in, I really don't expect a significant change. It is something that will balance, Roger. I believe I said earlier, ANS, the biggest difference is ANS. It has about 5x lower sulfur than WCS. So that's why we believe there will be a lot of blending going on, on the West Coast. But I do believe, in general, you will see it limit other's toolkits on what the amount is that they can run but we've yet to see -- we need to see that play out. Yes, Matt, it's Rick again. So I will tell you, good call out. We're seeing octane values being extremely high. And as you know, we have a lot of reforming capacity. So we are a large octane producer, so we're seeing the benefit. Certainly, you hit on a couple of the reasons. Specs is certainly a region. But I will also tell you, we're seeing strong signals on the export side.\n And when you think about the export market, we're sending over volume there that generally does not have ethanol in it. So that is eating up a lot of octane [ long ] product. And then there is persistent length from the NAFTA market due to poor petchem margins. So that's helping us out on the octane side. \n And then lastly, more recently here, you're certainly seeing the impact of high turnarounds, just taking octane off the market here in Q1, and it's carrying into Q2, and we see it persisting for a while, Matt. Yes. So great comment. And my comment earlier, the industry, I would say, is long diesel, and we're not alone in that category, we are as well. And you're right, we've got to find export opportunities, Matt, whether anything waterborne where we can find a home to clear the product is what we and others are doing. Theresa, can you restate the back half of your question, I'm not sure I caught that part, please. This is Rick. Yes, good question. So it can be significant. And depending on the region it's just tough, as you pointed out, in an upward market. If you look at Q1 to your point, Theresa, I think we had a $14 flat price increase throughout the quarter. So it definitely was a headwind, and it can be significant. We, amongst all of our competitors need to be competitive at our racks and in an up market, it continues to be a headwind. So I don't have a specific number that I can share with you. but it's definitely a factor in our capture."

            "content": "Thanks, Maryann. Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2023 to first quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $300 million, driven primarily by heavy planned turnaround activity, resulting in lower R&M throughputs. \n To assist with your analysis, we thought it helpful to note the company recorded an $89 million or $0.20 per share charge resulting from the quarterly fair value remeasurement of certain long-term incentive compensation. Aligned with shareholder value creation, the charge was driven by the $53 or 36% increase in our share price as well as our total shareholder return performance versus our peers during the quarter. Again, this charge, which we did not adjust for, reduced earnings by $0.20 per share. \n The tax rate for the quarter was 18%, resulting in a tax provision of $293 million. While this rate is lower than what we'd expect to receive for the year, it reflects the permanent tax benefits of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in MPLX as well as a discrete benefit related to equity compensation realized in the quarter. \n Moving to our segment results, Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the first quarter. Our Refining & Marketing results reflect lower throughputs associated with planned turnaround activity as our refineries ran at 82% utilization processing over 2.4 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs were $6.14 per barrel in the first quarter. Higher sequentially, primarily due to the lower throughputs. Sequentially, per barrel margins were up slightly as higher crack spreads were offset by lower margin capture. \n Slide 9 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment is growing and generating strong cash flows. In this quarter, MPLX's distribution contributed $550 million in cash flow to MPC. As Mike said, MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and is a differentiator for us. \n Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was over $1.9 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining & Midstream businesses. Working capital was a $389 million use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by minor builds in crude and refined product inventories mainly related to the turnaround activity. This quarter, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions were $1.3 billion, including $710 million of growth and maintenance capital and $622 million for MPLX acquisitions net of cash received. Highlighting our steadfast commitment to superior shareholder returns, MPC returned $2.5 billion via repurchases and dividends during the quarter. \n As Mike commented, earlier today, we announced the approval of an additional $5 billion for share repurchases and as of April 26, we have $8.8 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations. And from May of 2021 through April 26 of this year, we have repurchased 312 million shares or 48% of the shares that were outstanding in May of 2021. At the end of the first quarter, MPC had approximately $7.6 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, which includes $385 million of MPLX cash. \n Turning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our second quarter outlook. With our significant first quarter turnaround activity behind us, we are projecting higher throughput volumes of nearly 2.8 million barrels per day representing utilization of 94%. Planned turnaround expense is expected to be approximately $200 million in the second quarter, with activity primarily in the Mid-Con region. \n Operating costs are projected to be $4.95 per barrel in the second quarter, much lower than the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of running our system near full utilization and lower expected operating costs. For the full year, we expect operating cost per barrel to trend towards a more normalized level of $5 per barrel subject to energy cost volatility. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion for the second quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $200 million. \n With that, let me pass it back to Mike. Yes. And Manav, it's John. Just to build on what Maryann is saying to connect some dots as well. Those additional projects that we took the time to do, right? You can see some of that turnaround, some of that on OpEx but really, we felt like given the window we had and getting ready for the rest of the year, that was the right thing to do. Sorry, I just wanted to add that. Yes. Manav, it's John. And I'm not sure this question came up on the MPLX call as well, but I know a little bit about it from my prior role. Remember, there's maybe less sensitivity on the L&S side of that business as refinery utilization moves higher and lower, just given the contractual structure of those contracts. So while there is some sensitivity, it may not be as much as you might be thinking. Great. Jason, it's John. Let me take the first part of that, and then I'll turn it over to Maryann. But just to clarify, that other that you're seeing on the R&M walk, it is not related to Martinez. Largely, what you're seeing there are, and you've seen it in prior quarters are some of the insurance proceeds we've recognized in regards to a claim we had at some of our refineries. But I'll turn it over to Maryann to talk about Martinez, but I want to clarify, it's not in that bar."

            "name": "Michael Hennigan",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Effective March 1, two new Independent Directors join the MPC Board. Eileen Drake and Kimberly Ellison-Taylor have strong records of accomplishment in complex industries making them outstanding additions, and we're happy to have them join our Board. \n As for the macro refining environment, we remain constructive in our view. Oil demand is at a record high globally, and we expect oil demand to continue to set records into the foreseeable future. Forecasted outlook for this year estimate 1.2 million to 2 million barrels per day of incremental demand over 2023, primarily driven by the growing need for transportation fuels. Within our own domestic and export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline and growth for diesel and jet fuel. And we continue to believe that 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption. \n Global supply remains constrained. Anticipated capacity additions have progressed more slowly than expected. And longer term, the level of announced capacity additions remains limited for the rest of the decade. In the first quarter, high global turnaround activity, the transition to summer gasoline blends, and light product inventories supported refining fundamentals, especially towards the end of the quarter. As we look forward, we believe these fundamentals will support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for the refining industry. \n We believe the U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. Our system has a locational advantage given the accessibility of nearby crude which we believe will grow as cost of transportation increases. The availability of low-cost natural gas, low-cost butane and our refining systems complexity all increase our competitive advantage over the international sources of supply. \n Even with this outlook, we remain focused on capital discipline while investing to grow earnings at strong returns. In the first quarter, we invested over $1.3 billion in capital expenditures. Investments and acquisitions comprised of attractive refining projects and Midstream investments, including MPLX's $625 million strategic acquisition in the Utica Basin. \n In Refining, we are investing predominantly at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. With a focus on safety and asset reliability, we successfully completed the largest amount of planned maintenance work in MPC's history. Four of our largest and most profitable refineries were in turnaround during the quarter, limiting our financial performance. These assets were in turnaround during a period of lower demand and now we're ready to meet the increased consumption that comes with the summer driving season. \n In Midstream, MPLX continues to execute on attractive growth opportunities. The Harmon Creek II gas processing plant was placed into service in late February, bringing MPLX's Marcellus processing capacity to 6.5 billion cubic feet per day. And in the Permian Basin, Preakness II is approaching startup and expected to be online by the end of May. We're also building our seventh gas processing plant in the basin, Secretariat, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, our total processing capacity in the Delaware Basin will be approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day, which would average to a pace of roughly one new plant per year since 2018. \n Additionally, MPLX announced two strategic transactions. First, in the Utica, MPLX enhanced its footprint through the acquisition of additional ownership interest in an existing joint venture and a dry gas gathering system. We've already seen growth in the rich gas window of the Utica and we see new producers moving into the region. \n Second, MPLX entered into a definitive agreement to combine the Whistler pipeline and Rio Bravo pipeline projects into a newly formed joint venture. The platform expands MPLX's natural gas value chain and positions MPLX for future growth opportunities. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio. Its current $2.2 billion annualized cash distribution MPC fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to continue to increase its cash distributions as it pursues growth opportunities, further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. \n Our overall capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend, and we intend to grow the company's earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. \n Beyond these three priorities, we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. Demonstrating this commitment, today, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization. Our total capital return through share repurchases and dividends since May of 2021 now totals $35 billion with MPC share count reduced by nearly 50%. \n Let me take a second to share our view on value. We continue to believe share repurchases make sense at the current share price level. When we purchased MPC stock, we are buying into a premier, highly advantaged refining system. We're also buying into a growing Midstream business via our ownership at MPLX. \n And finally, we are buying strong business execution, disciplined investment and a commitment to capital returns, which will continue to position MPC as an excellent investment. \n At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann. In summary, our unwavering commitment to safety, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement positions us well. We will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets. We will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. The enhanced mid-cycle environment should continue longer term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. \n MPLX remains a source of growth and a unique competitive advantage in our portfolio. We believe it will continue to grow its cash distributions to cover both MPC's dividend and capital requirements and still generate excess cash before the first dollar of refining EBITDA is earned. \n Another way to frame it, MPC has reduced its share count from approximately 650 million in May of 2021, down to approximately 355 million at the end of the first quarter. Over this same time frame, the MPLX units owned by MPC has held roughly flat at approximately 650 million units. So the ratio of MPLX units held by MPC to our outstanding shares or the potential value to MPC on a per share basis from MPLX has nearly doubled. \n The Midstream business, which continues to grow, provides a unique value proposition for MPC shareholders. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice, with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior returns supported by our steadfast commitment to return capital. \n Consistent with our goal to have the strongest through-cycle cash generation, even with four of our most profitable refineries in turnaround adjusted on a comparable basis, we still generated more cash from operations than our refining peers. Very proud of the team's accomplishments. \n With that, let me turn the call back to Kristina. Neil, I'll let Rick start off with that one. Yes. Neil, this is Mike. Thanks for that question. There is no change in our commitment to returning capital, evidenced by the fact that we got the board to authorize another $5 billion. So what I would say to you is, don't read into the quarter-by-quarter variability. \n To your point, it could have been a little bit higher, but there's a lot of factors that are influencing the activity within the quarter. So the takeaway should be, we are committed and that hasn't changed. We believe in returning capital to shareholders. You're going to continue to see us do that. Yes, Manav, I think you've said it very well. I'll let Rick add some comments. But in general, like we said in our prepared remarks, global supply is constrained. And we are a believer that demand will continue to set records year after year throughout the rest of the decade. So we're very bullish demand with a constrained supply scenario leads us to situation that we have in the market today. We don't see it changing based on everything that we know is available to us, and that's why we have that view. But I'll let Rick add some color. And Manav, let me also add that historically, the demand numbers continue to get revised up. I know everybody's real time in their thought process, but it's also good to look back no matter which agency is doing. In fact, the U.S. agency, when they put the monthlies out, have continually for a long period of time, been underestimating gasoline and diesel demand. So it's just another factor that should put on people's radar to really look at all the revisions that have occurred because the demand numbers have been stronger, once they get fully corrected, embedded, then they are sometimes in the real-time disclosures. Manav, it's Mike. I just want to add. I think the takeaway is, as Maryann said is, we chose to use the first quarter to take down four of our most profitable refineries. It's a lower demand period in the U.S., et cetera. And our thought process there was spend that money, increase the reliability, get ourselves ready so that we're able to perform in the second and third quarters as we progress out the year. So we think we've positioned ourselves very well despite a heavy spend in the quarter. We're happy that we've done it. We think the assets are in really good shape, and we're looking forward to the rest of the year. Yes, John, this is Mike. I'll start off by saying we've been fortunate enough to continue to generate cash. That's been a good story for us. Back to Neil's first question, we want to make sure there's no ambiguity. We're committed to returning capital. \n One of the questions that Neil asked was is it a little lower in the quarter? And I tried to explain to not read into that quarter-to-quarter variability because a lot of factors that impact that. So I think the biggest takeaway is we're huge believers in returning capital to shareholders. And depending on the market conditions, et cetera, we evaluate it at every single quarter. And we try and put a program in place that prioritizes that.\n At the same time, we're also looking at where should we invest. You heard Maryann just talk about, we decided to spend a little bit more money in the first quarter to enhance the reliability of our assets. That's a good decision on our part. It's the first decision in our capital framework. But going forward, I think the big takeaway is you'll continue to see us be a leader in returning capital to shareholders. That's something we believe in. \n You'll see us be a leader in generating cash among our peers. As I said in my prepared remarks, very happy despite the situation we were in the first quarter with four of our largest, most profitable assets down, we still generated more cash than our peers. So we think that was a good accomplishment. \n And over time, you're going to see that we'll remain committed to our capital framework, of which -- when will we get to that $1 billion? That's a good question. I don't know that I can predict it depending on how the market treats us. But I think the biggest takeaway is we're committed to returning capital. And as long as we continue to generate cash, we'll continue to do that and reduce the share count going forward. Yes, John, I can't help myself to jump in here. I know this capture metric gets a lot of discussion. And Kristina has been steadfast that we need to report on it. I just want to caution, as I always do, that there's a lot of factors, market factors, et cetera, that hit on that. The market should know we're committed to improving our commercial performance. That's obviously a goal here. But the metric that I want is to look at the most is cash. \n At the end of the day, go to the bottom of the sheet as opposed to all the very different variables throughout it. The most important thing is are we generating the most cash. So that's the metric that I start with as we analyze the performance of the assets, et cetera. So I just want to reiterate that. I know a lot of people like to talk capture, it's not the one that I think tells the story of the business that much. Yes, Theresa, we don't have a target per se using that term. We do have a goal of generating increasing cash flows from third parties as well as optimizing within our own system as well. The point I was trying to make is where we stand today, that distribution from MPLX covers the MPC dividend and more than half of the capital. \n But going out, and again, this isn't guidance, but if you look at the trend, we're going to continue to increase the MPLX distribution over time. And as you see that occurring and depending on the capital needs at the refining side of the business, the statement I said was there'll be a point where MPLX's distribution will cover the dividend and all of the capital and still have excess cash. That's how unique the competitive advantages of that business. \n And we've been bullish natural gas growth for a long time. And I always caution, I'm not saying natural gas price, I'm saying natural gas growth volume. We continue to believe that, that has tailwinds behind it whether it's all the topics that have been talked about recently. But as that continues to occur, that ability for MPLX cash generation increase will just continue, and it will get to a point where it's covering the dividend at MPC, the capital at MPC and still generate excess cash. That's where we're headed. So I don't know that we have a target other than that target, and we'll try and keep growing that."
