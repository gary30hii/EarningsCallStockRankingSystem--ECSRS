        "content": "Andrea James: Hello, everyone. Welcome to Axon's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Webinar. I'm Andrea James, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. This is actually our fourth quarterly earnings over Zoom, so its great to see faces again. Today, we have Axon CEO, Rick Smith; President, Luke Larson; CFO, Jawad Ahsan; Chief Revenue Officer, Josh Isner and Chief Product Officer, Jeff Kunins. First we're going to give prepared remarks and then we'll bring all of our analysts up into gallery view for Q&A. I hope you've all had a chance to read our shareholder letter, which was released after the market closed. You can find it at investor.axon.com. Our remarks today are meant to build upon the information in that robust letter. If for some reason we lose Internet or Zoom connectivity we'll make every effort to post a copy of our prepared remarks to investor.axon.com.  During this call we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made today are pursuant to and within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today and are not guarantees of future performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks are discussed further in our SEC filings.  Finally we really encourage you all to look at our updated ESG and corporate social responsibility report, which we published today in conjunction with our earnings. We are increasingly conscious of our social and corporate responsibility as our company and our shareholder base grows and we're pleased to share this comprehensive report with you.  Angel Ambrosio whom you're familiar with on this call is our Senior Manager of Investor Relations and ESG and we welcome you to reach out to us on this topic if that's interesting to you.  Okay go ahead, Rick. \nRick Smith: Thanks, Andrea. Hi everybody. I want to start by talking about 2020. The conventional narrative is that 2020 was a terrible year.  I'd like to offer a different perspective. Challenging times bring out the best in humanity. These are the times that inspire us to rise up to overcome to stretch ourselves. The hardest times become our finest hours. If we choose to focus on the negative there was plenty to see in 2020.  But if we look harder we can see so many signs of hope and progress supercharged by a global play, nations sprung into the kind of arms race we should want to see competing ferociously to cure a pandemic and we all know the results. Multiple vaccines developed 10 times faster than ever before. We adapted to a world where travel was simply off the table. So we virtualized ourselves and we learned to zoom around the world for business. And we got to see our kids for dinner every night.  My customer engagement has jumped more than tenfold as customers are now open to video conferencing. And we've enjoyed seeing you our analysts and our investor community face-to-face in our new quarterly conference Zoom calls. I don't mean to minimize the pain we all experienced in 2020. I understand and I shared it. My mother passed away days before Christmas after contracting COVID. But even in that's sorrow came progress as we came together and we healed some fractured relationships within our own family.  I would not have chosen for 2020 to turn out as it did, but as we've said before we don't get to choose what the world throws at us, but we can choose how we respond. The urgency resulting from the intent social strike in 2020 is accelerating the world's readiness to move beyond bullets to a world where telling each other is no longer something we simply accept is some immutable facet of human society.  It is supercharged our energy as we redouble our efforts to deliver TASER energy weapons that will outperform a traditional side arm before this decade is out. And our customers are embracing this goal. They have told us that the bar will be very high, but I'm confident our team will deliver.  2020 was also a year where Axon delivered incredible value to our customers and the communities they serve. As you can see, you can see it in our results. We knew that adversity would present opportunities for those individuals and those organizations that are nimble and adaptable just as ice ages create breakout opportunities for adaptable species to explosively grow in thereafter.  In the weeks following the arrival of COVID in North America, we transformed our offices into adjunct manufacturing spaces allowing us to spread out, create social distance and continue to deliver exceptional results that far anteed our most optimistic expectations. We didn't just deliver on our operational goals, we significantly outperformed them. I'm personally humbled by our team's ability to deliver exceptional results in a year filled with so much turmoil and adversity. We exceeded our goals and exited 2020 better position than we've ever been before from an operational, strategic and financial perspective. Here's a few highlights. We inked our first two programs of record with the federal government, including a $13 million US customs and border protection order for body cameras and digital evidence management. In the fourth quarter, we signed our largest TASER contract in company history, a $20 million order for TASER 7 from an international customer, eclipsing our record $15.5 million TASER order from the Department of Homeland Security in the prior quarter. In 2020, we passed $1 billion in total bookings with the majority of that coming from our core market of state and local public safety. In 2020, we also delivered the largest single contract deal in company history, a $46 million officer safety plan with one of our major city customers. On the product side, we launched Auto-Transcribe deployed customers on both respond and in records debuted unique new capabilities like priority ranked video audit and countless found software and device firmware improvements. At Axon, we are continuing to look forward. We had a recent executive planning session where we asked ourselves, where do we want to be at the end of this decade. And our answer was simple. Our vision is to be globally synonymous with our mission of protecting life by building the world's largest and most trusted network of safety devices and services. What an amazing opportunity to be part of such a talented team with such an aspirational mission. I'd like to conclude by telling you what I\u2019m hearing from our customers today. Making us as a key partner to transforming public safety, we hear stories daily about customers using our products to save lives and to protect communities. Our Net Promoter Scores are hitting new highs. And our customers are actively and enthusiastically supporting our mission to make the bullet obsolete so that officers will no longer have to make the most terrible choices. We know that we're welcoming a lot of new shareholders onto our growth journey. So thank you for joining us for taking an interest. And with that, I'd like to turn over the call to our President, Luke Larson. \nLuke Larson: Thanks Rick. As 2020 showed us a lot that happens in this world is outside of our control. Against that backdrop Axon employees really showed up engage their best in the areas that matter the most. I want to give an emphatic thanks to all of our employees. Thank you. At Axon, we've built an amazing team and that talent is a huge asset and competitive advantage that doesn't show up on the balance sheet. Our team is laser-focused on a clear mission inspired by our purpose and leaning in with an owner's mindset with a maniacal focus on delivering value for our customers. In 2020, we focus on our commitment to the mission to our customers and the caring for the health and safety of our employees. In 2020, Axon was able to outperform in a difficult year, because we built a phenomenal team. Looking to the future our company has the talent, infrastructure and capabilities to manage challenging environments and thrive. The company earned this position over three decades by taking risks, making bold decisions, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development, countless hours of engineering, tens of thousands of hours of customer meetings, and most importantly, maintaining an unfaltering commitment to our mission. As we look to 2021, we have four key objectives: one, grow the core; two, scale new products; three, unlock new markets; and four, drive efficiency to fuel growth. We're also taking care of the amazing team that we've built. Our employees' health and growth remains a top priority. We recently added Ginger, a Mental Health app providing 24/7 support to our employees as well as rolled out Linkedin Learning to the entire company. In 2021, we will continue to look for ways to support our working parents and caregivers. In 2021 and we'll continue to invest in our people, products and sales channels helping individuals level up, aim higher and push harder to make our mission a reality. I'll close out by talking about one of the areas of added investment, which allows us to go after a $2 billion total addressable market and that is our investment in virtual reality training. As a former military officer, I saw how the DODs near unlimited budget can create amazing training like markdowns filled with thousands of Arabic speaking actors, huge multi group training, as well as unmatched simulator training with pilot used for flight training. In law enforcement though, they don't have the luxury of these enormous budgets or the benefit of having the majority of their time available to train. With virtual reality, we can leverage the best-in-class instructors and training to create scenarios that can be used across hundreds of thousands of officers bringing the cost down to a very economical price that can democratize training and action is poised to be a leader in creating this new category just like we've done with the TASER devices, our Axon Body cameras, our digital \u2013 system Evidence.com. And we're going to do it again with the virtual reality training. In 2021, we intend to transform how agencies train our officers by addressing the inefficiencies around the classroom, full playing and simulator train and by leveraging VR, we can address their two biggest issues, budget and time. We'll accomplish this through three assets: First, we have an exciting product launch that we can't say more on but it is coming soon; second, we intend to regularly release new training modules; and third, we are doubling down on our community engagement training preform. We're seeing encouraging signs on demand for this product and we're excited about where it can go. Earlier I talked about the amazing team and culture we've built at Axon. Before I hand it over to our CFO, Jawad Ahsan, you want to learn more about that culture. I recommend you check out his book What They Didn't Tell Me, you can get it on Amazon. So with that let me turn it over to our CFO, Jawad Ahsan. \nJawad Ahsan: Thanks, Luke. I want to start by talking about the number 28. I'm now referring to the number of days in this month, but rather three important milestones we hit as a company this quarter. We delivered 28% growth on revenue over 2019. 28% compound annual growth in revenue over the last five years and we finished the year with 28% in adjusted EBITDA margins. Now before I dive deeper into these, I want to talk about something else, the perception of our two business segments. We've discussed with you at great length, the investments we've been making in our pivot to a tech-enabled solutions company. The perception of our software and Sensors segment is best described by letting the numbers speak for themselves. Year-over-year, total revenues in this segment grew 26% and our ARR grew 37%. When I joined Axon in 2017 and our stock price was at $22, many investors told me that they viewed our stock as appropriately valuing our TASER device business with a free option on a high-growth software business. I think it's safe to say that we're now seeing some value in our stock price for our software business. But what about that TASER devices segment, the one that's been around since 1993? Was there maybe a perception that its best days are behind it? If so, we shattered that perception with our 2020 results. Our TASER Weapons segment grew revenues 30% year-over-year, outpacing even our fast-growing software and sensors segment. We're very proud of the TASER energy devices that we've built. And believe that there's still a large base of untapped customers who have yet to adopt. So the 28% revenue growth over 2019 was really fueled by strength across the board in body-worn cameras and software and especially in TASER devices. We feel that this validates our strategy to invest aggressively in both R&D and channel expansion. R&D to stay ahead of the innovation curve in all of our product segments and channel investments that will unlock new markets and new geographies. We're going to run this play again in 2021. When we look back over the past five years and the 28% CAGR on revenue, that's also the result of investments we've been making along similar lines. As we look ahead to the next five years, we're very excited by the next wave of new products and technologies that are going to become an important part of our growth story in their own right. Technologies like VR, which Luke just talked about earlier and we feel can have a transformative impact on the critical area of training for law enforcement. Technologies like Axon Respond in our live streaming platform. What's particularly exciting with this one is the interest we're seeing outside of our core law enforcement market. For example, coronavirus in the vaccine rollout is top of mind for communities all over the world. A municipal security unit in Chile has been trialing Axon Respond live streaming to ensure the quality and security of the supply chain and transportation process for COVID-19 vaccine distribution in their community. Another technology we're excited about is our new ERP and CRM. Many people across Axon are working incredibly hard on upgrading these critical support systems and their associated processes, and they're already driving huge efficiencies as the early modules come online. Luke also talked about the importance of driving efficiencies to fuel growth. And we're laying the foundation today for a company that will be able to scale to $1 billion in revenue and well beyond. Now you might be wondering why am, I choosing to highlight our new ERP along with sexier technologies like VR and live streaming. And I'm doing it to highlight something I can sum-up in one word, discipline. We have our sight set on some lofty goals by 2030, as Rick mentioned, but our feet are firmly planted in the here and now. I'm so proud of the discipline we exhibit as a company on a day-to-day basis. In our capital allocation decisions, our budgeting, our execution. This is a team that is absolutely dialed in and ready to build on our momentum. And take our company to even greater heights. And with that, we're going to turn it over to questions.\nQuestion-and:\nA - Andrea James: Thank you, Jawad and team. Let's take our first question from Jonathan Ho at William Blair. Go ahead, Jonathan.\nJonathan Ho: Hi there. I just want to just start out with sort of a tremendous quarter and the year that federal and international had? Can you maybe talk about, what is driving sort of that increased demand? And is there sort of a broader mindset shift that you're seeing with either how agencies or national police forces are starting to look at the TASER?\nJosh Isner: Thanks Jonathan for the question. Ultimately, I think it's just a lot of hard work that our team is putting in. A few years ago we said we were going to continue to focus on Tier 1 markets until we felt really good about earning the right to go into Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. And now we're starting to see that kind of mechanism pay off. And this was a foundational year in 2020 in some of our Tier 2 markets. We're seeing new markets by TASERs, at high volumes and we're extremely excited for that trend to continue this year. And so we're really focused on growing the TASER business. And then earning the right to expand into other product lines in these markets and we're going to continue to execute day-to-day toward that end.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. And just as a follow-up on, have state local government pressures created any sort of headwinds in terms of your pipeline of opportunities. Or is it actually the reverse where maybe this is opening up some opportunities just given your strong value proposition? Thank you.\nJosh Isner: I don't -- I can't really offer an opinion on that to be honest. I think it's more just -- we're focused on covering the market as best we can, not only in state and local but in federal and international as well. And by doing that, certainly, we feel like we have the best products in law enforcement and public safety and we're going to continue to tell that story and make customers very happy. And turn them into evangelists for our company. And regardless of what pressures may or may not exist in any given year, we think that's the long-term winning formula.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nAndrea James: Thank you, Jonathan. And analysts, we do -- we have you all in the queue. We added you one by one as you joined the call this afternoon. So we've got you. No need to do the hands raise, but we appreciate the question. Okay. Will Power from Baird is our next. Go ahead, Will.\nWill Power: Right, great. Yeah, this is a bit of a follow-up I guess, to the previous question in the international comments. But just looking at TASER obviously just a huge quarter, any other color you can provide on the key underpinnings there, as you look at the upside in the quarter what was the upside surprise if there was? Obviously, you had one big customer that looks broad-based more than that. Is it tied to certain geographies, certain types of local agencies versus federal? Anything else you'd call out with respect to that TASER strength?\nRick Smith: Yeah, sure. So, I think we had some visibility into some large deals in Q4, but not to get too specific. But some of the challenges in this environment are making sure we can deliver and get accepted in short periods of time. And we did get the order in time in Q4 and we're able to deliver it. We view that as kind of a 50-50 proposition in early November. The team did a fantastic job executing. But behind that one large order there were a series of kind of mid-sized orders in international across all three geographies. The Americas EMEA and APAC and I think it just speaks to the work the team is doing to really focus in on markets that are now ready to move to more less lethal solutions. And again, we believe, we can parlay that into body camera adoption and records management adoption and virtual reality adoption and so forth over the long-term.\nWill Power: If I could stick a question for Luke, I know, as you talked about the key 2021 objectives you had four key ones. One of them were scaling new products. Wonder if maybe if you could just update us with respect to records and respond, what are you putting in place to accelerate growth there? What does that cadence of opportunities look like as you kind of move through 2021 here? \nLuke Larson: Yes. Well we're seeing a lot of interest from our customers specifically around the entire kind of Axon portfolio where we see the biggest adoption of these capabilities is in our officer safety plans that we offer. I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Kunins to add a little more color on the specific product details. \nJeff Kunins: Sure. Thanks so much for the question. So on records we're -- we continue to be incredibly pleased with our momentum and records. A latest good data point is that 40 agencies have now signed or in deployment or are live on one or more modules of records including more than a dozen we've committed to full replacement of their legacy RMS. In addition to that within that early momentum with major cities specifically continues. Two recent examples are that, Atlanta actually went live on the standard use of force module of records in Q4. And Baltimore, which has been publicly announced before as an upcoming full records customer is on track for their deployment this year. So we're incredibly excited about the continued accelerating momentum there. Also as we -- you saw in the shareholder letter on respond for devices, we had a 7x growth in live streaming and other aspects of engagement of the product over the last six months and continue to really see really strong adoption of all aspects of response for devices across the footprint. And as Rick talked about in the beginning, some of the key further additions we're making to the product line that compound the value of all those pieces together that we're most excited about include Auto Transcribe. So now that our Auto Transcribe unlimited package is out it powers a whole variety of scenarios including not just accelerating evidence management, but also new capabilities like priority ranked video audit which really helps agencies use the data that's underneath their body camera video to help them with making sure that they're compliant with policy and helping make them make their body warm camera programs more effective than ever. \nAndrea James: Thank you. Well really appreciate it. Next question from Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum. Go ahead Jeremy. \nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks Andrea. Congratulations on an incredible year to the team. I wanted to come back to the international for a second, where you clearly have a ton of momentum and I think this is probably directed towards Josh. Just in understanding the international cycle -- sales cycle which has typically been longer over the years. It does seem like with the momentum that potentially there's greater urgency being seen with the customers that you're talking to. But I wanted to get a sense on whether or not that international sales cycle is starting to compress and if you're realizing these contracts sooner? Or this is just reaping the fruit of a number of years of laying foundation, but it does feel like that sales cycle is compressing a little bit? \nJosh Isner: Yes. Certainly. Thanks Jeremy. I think it is compressing a little bit. And I think the other element we have is we've added to our international team pretty substantially over the last three or four years. I think it's probably started around 10 people in 2016 that were direct sellers and we've multiplied that by two or three at least. And the result of that is we just have more activity in the pipeline quarter-over-quarter. So that pipeline is starting to come into fruition and there's certainly an element of the sales cycle seems to be speeding up a little bit, but we just have way more opportunities now every quarter and certainly it relieves a little bit of pressure of fewer opportunities and we have more ways to get there now which feels great and we're going to continue to focus on building that out and we're making some investments again this year in certain markets to create even more momentum. And hopefully, we'll continue to see that trend in the years to come. \nJeremy Hamblin: Great. And I wanted to ask, I know you can't provide a ton of details around the new product launch. But historically, when you've had major product launches, you take a little bit of a step back on the margin front, investment being made both on the sales side of the equation, but obviously also some in R&D. I just wanted to get a sense in terms of the revenue base as a whole is significantly larger than it's been in the past. And just to get a sense for if there is going to be some margin drag this year, can you quantify, can you give us a sense of the magnitude as you look at both what sounds like an entirely new product launch, but also some of the other -- whether it's records developments or dispatch whatnot, the potential drag that you might see on margins?\nJawad Ahsan: Yes, I'll take this one. Jeremy, it's a good question. We are not expecting any margin drag from the new products that we're launching. We're actually expecting some margin expansion. In 2020, we were looking at some of the headwinds that we had on TASER. We also had some customer mix as far as international shipments and that's behind us. And so in this year even with the new products we're launching. For some of the newer ones specifically like VR, there's a little bit of a drag from a hardware perspective, but it's so small as so as to be negligible. Overall, we're not expecting any drag.\nJeremy Hamblin: Last one for me, real quick on supply chain. So, as you've gotten more federal contracts and so forth, and obviously we know how you're producing TASERs and the cameras. Has there been any pressure to alter your supply chain? Is that something that you're considering down the road and where you're sourcing cameras and how the cameras are coming?\nLuke Larson: We've got decades of experience producing our TASER devices where ICAR is restricted, which means we have to manufacture in the US. And so we feel really, really good about that process. On the camera side, it's something that we definitely keep an eye on. As it sits today, we still feel really, really good with the way that we manufacture and then kind of load the final firmware on the product. And so, I don't see anything from kind of the supply chain side, I would defer to Josh, if he's hearing anything from the customers.\nJosh Isner: Yes. I think we're in a fantastic position inventory and supply chain wise. Our customers have been delighted that we've really at times accelerated the speed at which we're able to deliver large deals and that's a huge credit to Josh Goldman and our entire operations team. They're just doing a fantastic job supporting our customers. And this is actually over the years the best I've ever felt about, our ability on the supply chain and logistics side to please customers. So, I'm really, really bullish going into this year in that regard.\nJeremy Hamblin: Great. Congrats and best wishes this year. Thanks.\nAndrea James: Thank you, Jeremy. Next question is from Erik Lapinski at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Erik.\nErik Lapinski: Hi. Thanks, and congrats on the quarter. Last month, you announced a deal with a private security company. And I guess I'm just wondering what kind of opportunity do you think that market can represent. Are you seeing interest from other private customers? Or is that maybe a one-off type deal that wouldn't be something we could see again? And are there investments you could make to attack that?\nJosh Isner:\n-- :\nErik Lapinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then, maybe if I could just kind of squeeze one on the dispatch side. I know you had mentioned kind of over the last few quarters that you're building in incremental capabilities and maybe that would be a hold off for certain customers to start adopting that. I guess just wondering like where you are with that? Do you feel that the product is there? Is there enough of a road map for even a larger police department to kind of see it and potentially hold off on a replacement to migrate to you? Or I guess just -- I know it's early, but anything you can update us on there?\nJeff Kunins: Sure. Thanks Erik. It\u2019s a great question. I think first like, we said before dispatch are really more broadly this idea of respond of a real-time operations platform is a multiyear journey. And so we're very confident that over the next three to five years, we're going to wind up being number one in what's traditionally called the legacy computated dispatch market, but our sites are even broader and more ambitious than that. But as Jawad said earlier, our feet are also very firmly planted in the present. And so like right now today as you know we have one city live on our dispatch platform and we have multiple more that are signed and sold in the queue for deployment over the course of this year and going forward. So we feel very good about that pipeline. Just like we talked about records and really in any software category where you have an insurgent trying to unseat legacy competitors, which in this case we're the insurgent there's this journey of building up in the right way the capability is needed to be the right fit for each successive chunk of the market, while adding on top of that your unique differentiation that makes you a compelling reason to switch. And that's just -- that has nothing to do with Axon or CAD or records that's just the physics of any disruptive insurgent category like this. And we feel really good about where we're positioned and where we're going even though it's early. And in the case of dispatch, the sequence or latter there is first being great for law enforcement only PSAPs as opposed to ones that also do to fire and medical, but sort of the midsized cities, and then actually after that gearing up to also cover fire and medical, which we're actively working on this year. And then ultimately to be, not only the largest cities but the multi-jurisdiction PSAPs. So we feel fantastic about our trajectory but it is early in that journey but we need to keep you apprised as we win and deploy customers along that way.\nRick Smith: Let me jump on as well. I want to share a story. I talk to a police chief of the first agency I believe in the world, certainly in the United States that is live streaming every call in the dispatch, video live stream, and it was just so rewarding to have that phone call to hear the things that we have been imagining come to pass. And the month that you shared with me was it's just a total game changer. They found dispatchers are actually helping new officers in real time. He told me a story where the dispatcher heard a thud that the officer didn't right? Because the officer is in the scene there -- they've got total vision, sometimes they're focused on their own safety. The dispatcher is sort of a dispassionate aid. Well, turn out the thud in that case was a gun had been dropped to -- the person in the car dropped it and tried to kick it under the seat, the officer -- the dispatcher told the officer, hey, I heard something you should check and they discovered there was a gun and obviously that's a pretty important piece of information the way it's unfolding. The other thing that they shared with me was that by having the dispatchers watch the call, they just have far greater understanding than when they're just listening to a few cryptic transmissions over the radio and they're getting real-time oversight of every incident. So you think about everything that happened last year and now there's discussion about well how did the agencies pick the right videos to have a subsequent supervisory review? In this agency they're reviewing every video not by a supervisor but by a dispassionate dispatcher. And you can imagine if someone was saying something like I can't breathe that could be reacted to right now where the dispatcher could say, hey I need a supervisor to check this out and see what's going on in real-time not find out weeks later that that was happening. So is that, sort of, transformative new capability that we are uniquely able to position. And you'll probably guess there's a little bit of a dynamic tension between me and Jeff who keeps me honest where it's like, hey, we need to do the things he was talking about there, we've got to deliver on the core functions of what they need to be a functioning system today and blending the right amount of these new capabilities because you can't -- you've got to kind of have both and it's just wonder having Jeff on the team. I think he's really shepherding us through that process of how we blend the right mix of legacy features with the right mix of new features to be transformative and effective at displacing existing incumbents.\nJeff Kunins: So one last tiny bit just to put all that together is exactly that combination of why we declare respond and have a real-time operations platform that's the real category. Historical CAD is cute. Real-time operations platform is skating to where the puck is going. And from a business and this insurgent standpoint, the key is just like how with records an agency can adopt standards are use of first module of reps side-by-side with their legacy RMS even before they might be ready to make a full migration, respond for devices what we used to call at what there what Rick was just referring to our live streaming any PSAP. In conjunction with their law enforcement agency can easily deploy respond for device right in their PSAP alongside their legacy CAD even if they aren't ready to switch over for their full CAD, but that not only gets them into these scenarios earlier, but it also gets them acculturated to our experience and we think that's ultimately an accelerator to when they're ready to consider a full migration. \nErik Lapinski: Yes. That's awesome. Thanks for sharing that example. I mean that's definitely the vision coming to life. So congrats.\nRick Smith: Thanks, Erik.\nAndrea James: Thank you, Erik. Next question from Derek Soderberg at Colliers. Go ahead, Derek.\nDerek Soderberg: Thanks, Andrea. So I wanted to start with consumer TASER. It looks like that was pretty strong again this quarter. I was wondering if you can, sort of, elaborate on what drove that strength again? I know there have been some tailwinds due to the pandemic and some other things that happened in 2020. Just curious as to your thoughts on that business as we, sort of, move past that a little bit. How sustainable is consumer TASER strength? And, I guess, maybe longer term if you can update us on the strategy there to penetrate this -- the non-lethal weapons market?\nLuke Larson: Yes. Thanks for the question. Our consumer business doubled in revenues year-over-year 2020 over 2019. And some of that early in the year was the pandemic and some of the just overall lift in firearm sales and we were certainly a beneficiary of that. We did put a new general manager of the consumer business in place around second quarter last year and he's really up leveled our game. He is a marketing background, Matt Goren. He's got a very strong background in marketing and he's tried to move things for us. It actually had a very immediate effect and we've seen that momentum continue into 2021, which is how we know it's not a fluke. We've got some pretty lofty goals for the consumer business. We've got two new products that we're bringing to market by the end of this year. And longer term our ambition as a company is still to make the bullet of sleep and that doesn't just happen with building a better TASER device for law enforcement. We're planning on building a consumer device that also does the same thing. And then I want to turn it over to Rick and let him talk a little bit about his vision as well. \nRick Smith: Yes. So we started this business back in 1993, the original TASER was already being sold to police. Our original business model was to drop for consumer for two reasons. One it is where we can actually do even more moral good by saving lives. Police officers are involved in hundreds of lethal force incidents every year. But private citizens shoot and kill 35,000 to 40,000 of each other every year. So we can save the most lives that we can have impact there. And from a market scale perspective it's frankly just a much larger market. So even the block and got to these ubiquitous law enforcement has a far larger both dollar and unit volume they sell in the consumer market. So we're committed both for the business reasons and for the mission and north star regions to see the consumer continue to grow. And I think part of that -- I personally live we will hit a tipping point when we can actually prove that we can outperform a standard nine millimeter that is going to be transformative not only in our core US law enforcement. I think every other police agency around the world, I don't want to start naming off entries here, but pretty much any country is not going to have the same relationship with guns that Americans do. So let's just take Iceland as an example. If we could outperform their black hand guns all of a sudden, I think, we could become the standard weapon and I just picked that as a totally random country. But you go around the world, and I think the minute that we can actually say this could replace your firearm. Every police force that carries a firearm is now a customer and they're going to be under tremendous political and moral pressure to use the better safer thing that saves large. I think that also opens up the consumer market. So I think we're in the early innings. We entered enforcement in 1999 to prove the technology work so we could reenter the consumer market and that play has still not played out yet. And I'd also like to say we moved consumer under Jawad a couple of years ago and he gets a lot of credit for breathing new energy in bringing that [indiscernible] in and this is kind of Jawad's one of his passion project that\u2019s helping us in the consumer space.\nDerek Soderberg: Great. Thank you for the detailed math. And as my follow-up, Rick, last quarter you had sort of mentioned the conversation you had had with U.S. congressperson. I guess, now with the new administration, new representatives, I guess I'm curious as to how those conversations have evolved over the last quarter. Are you sort of feeling that same sense of optimism around maybe sort of a sweeping police reform bill that includes body cams or how is your sort of sense of optimism changed?\nRick Smith: Well, my sense of optimism is pretty dauntless. If anything, sometimes I need to people to make sure I keep my feet grounded. I would say that though, I think that the trends towards body cameras and less lethal weapons and all the things we're doing is really more ground up. There's certainly been some talk about whether there's going to be a legislative action at the federal level. I don't want to guess on that. I mean that would obviously, could be very helpful if it happens. But we're not -- that's nowhere in our plans. We think we are just continuing to win the hearts and minds of agencies and communities and the end user by delivering stuff that saves their careers saves their lives save them all the trauma of having to deploy lethal force, or having their integrity questioned when something controversial happens and knowing they can defend themself to the body camera. So I think I wouldn't say anything has changed positive or negative at the political level. I think, we're just continuing to see that groundswell from the state and local. That's where these decisions really get made. \nDerek Soderberg: Great. Thanks so much.\nRick Smith: Awesome. Great questions.\nAndrea James: Okay. Thank you, Derek. Our next question is from Keith Housum at Northcoast. Go ahead Keith. Keith, you\u2019re up next and you're muted. There you go.\nKeith Housum: Sorry, about that. I just want to echo guys, congratulations again on the quarter and a great year. If I can provide a little bit -- dig down a little bit deeper on the TASERs for the year. Obviously tremendous growth. How much of that growth is coming from a nontraditional state and local agencies? You guys were talking about a number of different initiatives in terms of federal and jails and corrections and the security. But if you kind of provide a bit of color and break out between, I guess, the old sources of revenue as well as the new?\nJosh Isner: Yes, absolutely. I appreciate the question, Keith. International certainly was a big driver of CW weapons growth. I think we've talked about that to a large extent already. Federal also is a place where we had a good year last year, in terms of some new agencies coming on board with some of our newer CWs. This year we certainly expect to see more of that in our federal business. We're really excited about a couple of the CW opportunities that are out there. And then, state and local with, really hitting our stride with TASER 7. State and local bookings, it's a market we hear every year questions about, hey is the growth slowing down as it flattening out. And last year state and local bookings were up almost 30%. And so that was -- I would say pretty equal weighting between body cameras and TASERs. And so, I think across all segments of the market, the team is doing just an exceptional job of making sure that we continue to grow the TASER line. We certainly believe like every single law enforcement officer is better served carrying a TASER than not. And until that happens we got a lot of work to do, to bring that into fruition. So that's really what we're focused on, not only in federal or international but also in state and local, where there's still plenty of room to go there. \nKeith Housum: Okay. Appreciate it. And I would be remiss, if I didn't ask the question about the guidance. It looks like the guidance for the full year next year is about 12% growth year-over-year. You obviously got some great tailwinds at your back, but you're obviously going in some huge numbers at your content. If I look at cartridges I look at the consumer devices, obviously, some good tailwinds for you. And you guys have never grown only 12%, I think, at least in the recent history ever. What gives you the indication that revenue growth is going to actually slow down so much year-over-year?\nJosh Isner: Yes. We're certainly not done. In the last couple of years you've seen growth in the mid- to high 20s. You've also seen that those years tend to be back-end loaded. Q3 and Q4 combined are usually significantly higher than Q1 and Q2 combined. And so as we think about it right, it's early February. We're certainly trying to sell far more than 760 and that's our goal every year is to exceed our growth rate in the previous year. But having said that, we haven't seen the pipeline materialize for the back half to the point where we can be a little more aggressive on our guidance. And in quarter one, we have to be responsible and disciplined about how we guide. And so this is something we're going to revisit every quarter. And as that back half pipeline materializes you'll certainly hear more about that as it is happening. But on day one here we're starting with 760. And like I said though we got -- and like you said, we have a lot of tailwinds and we're really focused on another great year in revenue.\nKeith Housum: Okay. Appreciate. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Okay. Anybody have anything to add? Okay? So we're not seeing any slowdown just want to make that clear. Thank you.\nJawad Ahsan: Andrea, I actually might piggyback on that from an EBITDA standpoint for guidance, just how you should think about that provide some more context. So ever since I joined Axon, it's been really important to me that we're demonstrating both growth on our top line as well as driving leverage on our bottom line. And we've not only done exactly that over the last few years, but it's also been a central tenet of our long-term guidance as you know. So it's super important to us that we're continuing to invest to stay ahead of the innovation curve. That's another sort of thing that we're trying to solve for. So every year we put together an operating plan or a budget that's trying to solve for those three things; top line growth driving leverage and investing for growth. And it's actually super hard to do, but we've got a very talented management team and that's what we've been doing. However, one of the dynamics as Josh pointed out of our business is that our revenue profile throughout the year is back-half weighted. And even then it's really more concentrated in Q4 than in Q3. So what happens is if we hit our revenue targets, our EBITDA comes in on plan on our internal plan. And we drive that a little bit of incremental margin expansion while still having invested in things like R&D or the channel, but if we beat our revenue targets especially in the fourth quarter, it's too late in the year to reinvest that upside. So we return it to shareholders, which is exactly what you saw this past quarter. So that's how you should be thinking about it from an EBITDA standpoint Keith, our base plan is solving for top line growth, incremental leverage and investing for growth. And to the extent that we exceed on the top line that will allow us to drive even more leverage. \nKeith Housum: Got it. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Jawad. Okay. Last question I believe unless anybody has follow-up is from Scott Berg at Needham. Go ahead, Scott.\nScott Berg: Great. Thanks. Congrats on the awesome quarter. I guess we've got a couple of questions. Jawad just a point of clarification first of all on the large TASER sales in the quarter. Were those -- was that $20 million order all for TASER 7s, given it's international and their propensity historically to buy something other than that? I just wanted to clarify that?\nJawad Ahsan: Yeah, Josh why don't you weigh in. That was all TASER 7. \nJosh Isner: It was TASER 7 and accessories associated with cartridges batteries holsters and so forth.\nScott Berg: No. Got it. And then just as a part of that is were they all purchased on a subscription plan? Or were they kind of an upfront product purchase? And I saw the mix in the quarter certainly down shifted for the mix of TASERs on subscription?\nJosh Isner: Yeah. It's a great question Scott. So for us in Tier 1 markets as well as in the United States, we do sell TASER 7 on subscription. But in Tier 2 markets and Tier 3 markets, we actually sell TASER 7 in a similar bundle, but it's available for an upfront purchase. The reason we do that is twofold. Number one, oftentimes there's distributors in the middle of the deal and that complicates how the subscription would work. In this case, there was no distributor. But Part 2 is we don't have a very strong well documented payment history with some of these first-time buyers for large TASER orders. And thus to protect the company and shareholders we do ask to be paid upfront so that we're not recognizing revenue ahead of getting paid more or less.\nScott Berg: Awesome. That's great. And then my final question, I don't know if this is for yourself Josh or maybe for Rick is your live stream usage up 7x from April to December that's a -- it's a big number. I know it's coming off a small base because you're just starting to get those devices in people's hands at the end of last year. But is that helping in the sales cycle yet? Are you seeing the ability to take that evidence or to take those customer experiences and actually parlay that into new customers that are on the fence whether or not to buy the AB3?\nRick Smith: Josh I'll let you take that one. \nJosh Isner: Yeah. We're really excited about where live streaming is going. Certainly, I think over this last year, we've seen a ton of very interesting use cases for the product, and we continue to see more and more. This is something that as new \u2013 new body camera customers that are purchasing AB3. We are seeing a reasonable number of them by live streaming on day one and then customers who have been upgraded to AB3 are trying live streaming early and often building it into their budget in the out quarters. And so under both kind of use cases we are seeing an uptick in live streaming and we think this is going to be central to the value proposition across all of our products long term. So certainly, it's an encouraging sign.\nJeff Kunins: Yeah. I think the one thing to add to that is that, when people buy access to respond for devices even in addition to or instead of if they're not ready-to-use live streaming per se simply activating their use of that LTE chip and the camera unlocks a bunch of other scenarios as part of our software, including simply having accurate location for 100% of their evidence which makes it easier to tag and find things later for like compliance, as well as the transcription scenario I was talking about earlier where they can now configure us that all of the \u2013 the audio from their video automatically goes up to evidence.com immediately upon finishing the recording, so they can move even faster on some of the evidence management pieces. So response for devices we love the live streaming scenario, but there's so much more that they unlock by buying that add on.\nScott Berg: Great. Congrats on the wonderful quarter. Thanks everyone.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Scott. I wanted to build upon Josh's answer on the pager subscription question just real quick. So those Tier 2 markets are the markets that we're a little bit newer to or we don't have always the established payment histories that we would have in Tier 1. Tier 1 tends to be the United States, the UK, Australia, Canada those English-speaking markets and Tier 2 are ones where we're new. And so we feel confident that over time we're going to be able to drive peter subscriptions in those markets, just like we did in the US and in the UK, but it's still early and we also don't have the payment history to extend the credit to do that today. Okay. Are there any other questions? Did anyone put their hand up? No. Okay. I think Rick we'll have you close us out.\nRick Smith: Awesome. Thanks Andrea, and thanks everybody for joining us today. Obviously, we're delighted to be able to turn in results like that, and I couldn't be more proud of the team. I was just sitting back noticing and listening to my team field the questions, it's just been amazing to see us come together, and it's been a challenging environment. But what a year to have turned in, I couldn't be more proud of everybody who helped make that happening. Many of our employees and team members that are tuned in listening thank you for just phenomenal effort in a crazy year. So, enough celebration on the great results in 2020. It's time to get to work on 2021, and we look forward to talking to you all on our next quarterly update. Thanks, and stay safe.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrea. Hi everybody. I want to start by talking about 2020. The conventional narrative is that 2020 was a terrible year.  I'd like to offer a different perspective. Challenging times bring out the best in humanity. These are the times that inspire us to rise up to overcome to stretch ourselves. The hardest times become our finest hours. If we choose to focus on the negative there was plenty to see in 2020.  But if we look harder we can see so many signs of hope and progress supercharged by a global play, nations sprung into the kind of arms race we should want to see competing ferociously to cure a pandemic and we all know the results. Multiple vaccines developed 10 times faster than ever before. We adapted to a world where travel was simply off the table. So we virtualized ourselves and we learned to zoom around the world for business. And we got to see our kids for dinner every night.  My customer engagement has jumped more than tenfold as customers are now open to video conferencing. And we've enjoyed seeing you our analysts and our investor community face-to-face in our new quarterly conference Zoom calls. I don't mean to minimize the pain we all experienced in 2020. I understand and I shared it. My mother passed away days before Christmas after contracting COVID. But even in that's sorrow came progress as we came together and we healed some fractured relationships within our own family.  I would not have chosen for 2020 to turn out as it did, but as we've said before we don't get to choose what the world throws at us, but we can choose how we respond. The urgency resulting from the intent social strike in 2020 is accelerating the world's readiness to move beyond bullets to a world where telling each other is no longer something we simply accept is some immutable facet of human society.  It is supercharged our energy as we redouble our efforts to deliver TASER energy weapons that will outperform a traditional side arm before this decade is out. And our customers are embracing this goal. They have told us that the bar will be very high, but I'm confident our team will deliver.  2020 was also a year where Axon delivered incredible value to our customers and the communities they serve. As you can see, you can see it in our results. We knew that adversity would present opportunities for those individuals and those organizations that are nimble and adaptable just as ice ages create breakout opportunities for adaptable species to explosively grow in thereafter.  In the weeks following the arrival of COVID in North America, we transformed our offices into adjunct manufacturing spaces allowing us to spread out, create social distance and continue to deliver exceptional results that far anteed our most optimistic expectations. We didn't just deliver on our operational goals, we significantly outperformed them. I'm personally humbled by our team's ability to deliver exceptional results in a year filled with so much turmoil and adversity. We exceeded our goals and exited 2020 better position than we've ever been before from an operational, strategic and financial perspective. Here's a few highlights. We inked our first two programs of record with the federal government, including a $13 million US customs and border protection order for body cameras and digital evidence management. In the fourth quarter, we signed our largest TASER contract in company history, a $20 million order for TASER 7 from an international customer, eclipsing our record $15.5 million TASER order from the Department of Homeland Security in the prior quarter. In 2020, we passed $1 billion in total bookings with the majority of that coming from our core market of state and local public safety. In 2020, we also delivered the largest single contract deal in company history, a $46 million officer safety plan with one of our major city customers. On the product side, we launched Auto-Transcribe deployed customers on both respond and in records debuted unique new capabilities like priority ranked video audit and countless found software and device firmware improvements. At Axon, we are continuing to look forward. We had a recent executive planning session where we asked ourselves, where do we want to be at the end of this decade. And our answer was simple. Our vision is to be globally synonymous with our mission of protecting life by building the world's largest and most trusted network of safety devices and services. What an amazing opportunity to be part of such a talented team with such an aspirational mission. I'd like to conclude by telling you what I'm hearing from our customers today. Making us as a key partner to transforming public safety, we hear stories daily about customers using our products to save lives and to protect communities. Our Net Promoter Scores are hitting new highs. And our customers are actively and enthusiastically supporting our mission to make the bullet obsolete so that officers will no longer have to make the most terrible choices. We know that we're welcoming a lot of new shareholders onto our growth journey. So thank you for joining us for taking an interest. And with that, I'd like to turn over the call to our President, Luke Larson. Yeah, sure. So, I think we had some visibility into some large deals in Q4, but not to get too specific. But some of the challenges in this environment are making sure we can deliver and get accepted in short periods of time. And we did get the order in time in Q4 and we're able to deliver it. We view that as kind of a 50-50 proposition in early November. The team did a fantastic job executing. But behind that one large order there were a series of kind of mid-sized orders in international across all three geographies. The Americas EMEA and APAC and I think it just speaks to the work the team is doing to really focus in on markets that are now ready to move to more less lethal solutions. And again, we believe, we can parlay that into body camera adoption and records management adoption and virtual reality adoption and so forth over the long-term. Let me jump on as well. I want to share a story. I talk to a police chief of the first agency I believe in the world, certainly in the United States that is live streaming every call in the dispatch, video live stream, and it was just so rewarding to have that phone call to hear the things that we have been imagining come to pass. And the month that you shared with me was it's just a total game changer. They found dispatchers are actually helping new officers in real time. He told me a story where the dispatcher heard a thud that the officer didn't right? Because the officer is in the scene there -- they've got total vision, sometimes they're focused on their own safety. The dispatcher is sort of a dispassionate aid. Well, turn out the thud in that case was a gun had been dropped to -- the person in the car dropped it and tried to kick it under the seat, the officer -- the dispatcher told the officer, hey, I heard something you should check and they discovered there was a gun and obviously that's a pretty important piece of information the way it's unfolding. The other thing that they shared with me was that by having the dispatchers watch the call, they just have far greater understanding than when they're just listening to a few cryptic transmissions over the radio and they're getting real-time oversight of every incident. So you think about everything that happened last year and now there's discussion about well how did the agencies pick the right videos to have a subsequent supervisory review? In this agency they're reviewing every video not by a supervisor but by a dispassionate dispatcher. And you can imagine if someone was saying something like I can't breathe that could be reacted to right now where the dispatcher could say, hey I need a supervisor to check this out and see what's going on in real-time not find out weeks later that that was happening. So is that, sort of, transformative new capability that we are uniquely able to position. And you'll probably guess there's a little bit of a dynamic tension between me and Jeff who keeps me honest where it's like, hey, we need to do the things he was talking about there, we've got to deliver on the core functions of what they need to be a functioning system today and blending the right amount of these new capabilities because you can't -- you've got to kind of have both and it's just wonder having Jeff on the team. I think he's really shepherding us through that process of how we blend the right mix of legacy features with the right mix of new features to be transformative and effective at displacing existing incumbents. Thanks, Erik. Yes. So we started this business back in 1993, the original TASER was already being sold to police. Our original business model was to drop for consumer for two reasons. One it is where we can actually do even more moral good by saving lives. Police officers are involved in hundreds of lethal force incidents every year.

            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Thanks Jonathan for the question. Ultimately, I think it's just a lot of hard work that our team is putting in. A few years ago we said we were going to continue to focus on Tier 1 markets until we felt really good about earning the right to go into Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. And now we're starting to see that kind of mechanism pay off. And this was a foundational year in 2020 in some of our Tier 2 markets. We're seeing new markets by TASERs, at high volumes and we're extremely excited for that trend to continue this year. And so we're really focused on growing the TASER business. And then earning the right to expand into other product lines in these markets and we're going to continue to execute day-to-day toward that end. I don't -- I can't really offer an opinion on that to be honest. I think it's more just -- we're focused on covering the market as best we can, not only in state and local but in federal and international as well. And by doing that, certainly, we feel like we have the best products in law enforcement and public safety and we're going to continue to tell that story and make customers very happy. And turn them into evangelists for our company. And regardless of what pressures may or may not exist in any given year, we think that's the long-term winning formula. Yes. Certainly. Thanks Jeremy. I think it is compressing a little bit. And I think the other element we have is we've added to our international team pretty substantially over the last three or four years. I think it's probably started around 10 people in 2016 that were direct sellers and we've multiplied that by two or three at least. And the result of that is we just have more activity in the pipeline quarter-over-quarter. So that pipeline is starting to come into fruition and there's certainly an element of the sales cycle seems to be speeding up a little bit, but we just have way more opportunities now every quarter and certainly it relieves a little bit of pressure of fewer opportunities and we have more ways to get there now which feels great and we're going to continue to focus on building that out and we're making some investments again this year in certain markets to create even more momentum. And hopefully, we'll continue to see that trend in the years to come. Yes. I think we're in a fantastic position inventory and supply chain wise. Our customers have been delighted that we've really at times accelerated the speed at which we're able to deliver large deals and that's a huge credit to Josh Goldman and our entire operations team. They're just doing a fantastic job supporting our customers. And this is actually over the years the best I've ever felt about, our ability on the supply chain and logistics side to please customers. So, I'm really, really bullish going into this year in that regard. --:Erik Lapinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then, maybe if I could just kind of squeeze one on the dispatch side. I know you had mentioned kind of over the last few quarters that you're building in incremental capabilities and maybe that would be a hold off for certain customers to start adopting that. I guess just wondering like where you are with that? Do you feel that the product is there? Is there enough of a road map for even a larger police department to kind of see it and potentially hold off on a replacement to migrate to you? Or I guess just -- I know it's early, but anything you can update us on there? Yes, absolutely. I appreciate the question, Keith. International certainly was a big driver of CW weapons growth. I think we've talked about that to a large extent already. Federal also is a place where we had a good year last year, in terms of some new agencies coming on board with some of our newer CWs. This year we certainly expect to see more of that in our federal business. We're really excited about a couple of the CW opportunities that are out there.

In the last couple of years you've seen growth in the mid- to high 20s. You've also seen that those years tend to be back-end loaded. Q3 and Q4 combined are usually significantly higher than Q1 and Q2 combined. And so as we think about it right, it's early February. We're certainly trying to sell far more than 760 and that's our goal every year is to exceed our growth rate in the previous year.

And like I said though we got -- and like you said, we have a lot of tailwinds and we're really focused on another great year in revenue. It was TASER 7 and accessories associated with cartridges batteries holsters and so forth. Yeah. It's a great question Scott. So for us in Tier 1 markets as well as in the United States, we do sell TASER 7 on subscription. But in Tier 2 markets and Tier 3 markets, we actually sell TASER 7 in a similar bundle, but it's available for an upfront purchase. The reason we do that is twofold. Number one, oftentimes there's distributors in the middle of the deal and that complicates how the subscription would work. In this case, there was no distributor. But Part 2 is we don't have a very strong well documented payment history with some of these first-time buyers for large TASER orders. And thus to protect the company and shareholders we do ask to be paid upfront so that we're not recognizing revenue ahead of getting paid more or less. Yeah. We're really excited about where live streaming is going. Certainly, I think over this last year, we've seen a ton of very interesting use cases for the product, and we continue to see more and more. This is something that as new \u2013 new body camera customers that are purchasing AB3. We are seeing a reasonable number of them by live streaming on day one and then customers who have been upgraded to AB3 are trying live streaming early and often building it into their budget in the out quarters. And so under both kind of use cases we are seeing an uptick in live streaming and we think this is going to be central to the value proposition across all of our products long term. So certainly, it's an encouraging sign."

            "name": "Jeff Kunins",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks so much for the question. So on records we're -- we continue to be incredibly pleased with our momentum and records. A latest good data point is that 40 agencies have now signed or in deployment or are live on one or more modules of records including more than a dozen we've committed to full replacement of their legacy RMS. In addition to that within that early momentum with major cities specifically continues. Two recent examples are that, Atlanta actually went live on the standard use of force module of records in Q4. And Baltimore, which has been publicly announced before as an upcoming full records customer is on track for their deployment this year. So we're incredibly excited about the continued accelerating momentum there. Also as we -- you saw in the shareholder letter on respond for devices, we had a 7x growth in live streaming and other aspects of engagement of the product over the last six months and continue to really see really strong adoption of all aspects of response for devices across the footprint. And as Rick talked about in the beginning, some of the key further additions we're making to the product line that compound the value of all those pieces together that we're most excited about include Auto Transcribe. So now that our Auto Transcribe unlimited package is out it powers a whole variety of scenarios including not just accelerating evidence management, but also new capabilities like priority ranked video audit which really helps agencies use the data that's underneath their body camera video to help them with making sure that they're compliant with policy and helping make them make their body warm camera programs more effective than ever. Sure. Thanks Erik. It's a great question. I think first like, we said before dispatch are really more broadly this idea of respond of a real-time operations platform is a multiyear journey. And so we're very confident that over the next three to five years, we're going to wind up being number one in what's traditionally called the legacy computated dispatch market, but our sites are even broader and more ambitious than that. But as Jawad said earlier, our feet are also very firmly planted in the present. And so like right now today as you know we have one city live on our dispatch platform and we have multiple more that are signed and sold in the queue for deployment over the course of this year and going forward. So we feel very good about that pipeline. Just like we talked about records and really in any software category where you have an insurgent trying to unseat legacy competitors, which in this case we're the insurgent there's this journey of building up in the right way the capability is needed to be the right fit for each successive chunk of the market, while adding on top of that your unique differentiation that makes you a compelling reason to switch. And that's just -- that has nothing to do with Axon or CAD or records that's just the physics of any disruptive insurgent category like this. And we feel really good about where we're positioned and where we're going even though it's early. And in the case of dispatch, the sequence or latter there is first being great for law enforcement only PSAPs as opposed to ones that also do to fire and medical, but sort of the midsized cities, and then actually after that gearing up to also cover fire and medical, which we're actively working on this year. And then ultimately to be, not only the largest cities but the multi-jurisdiction PSAPs. So we feel fantastic about our trajectory but it is early in that journey but we need to keep you apprised as we win and deploy customers along that way. So one last tiny bit just to put all that together is exactly that combination of why we declare respond and have a real-time operations platform that's the real category. Historical CAD is cute. Real-time operations platform is skating to where the puck is going. And from a business and this insurgent standpoint, the key is just like how with records an agency can adopt standards are use of first module of reps side-by-side with their legacy RMS even before they might be ready to make a full migration, respond for devices what we used to call at what there what Rick was just referring to our live streaming any PSAP. In conjunction with their law enforcement agency can easily deploy respond for device right in their PSAP alongside their legacy CAD even if they aren't ready to switch over for their full CAD, but that not only gets them into these scenarios earlier, but it also gets them acculturated to our experience and we think that's ultimately an accelerator to when they're ready to consider a full migration. Yeah. I think the one thing to add to that is that, when people buy access to respond for devices even in addition to or instead of if they're not ready-to-use live streaming per se simply activating their use of that LTE chip and the camera unlocks a bunch of other scenarios as part of our software, including simply having accurate location for 100% of their evidence which makes it easier to tag and find things later for like compliance, as well as the transcription scenario I was talking about earlier where they can now configure us that all of the \u2013 the audio from their video automatically goes up to evidence.com immediately upon finishing the recording, so they can move even faster on some of the evidence management pieces. So response for devices we love the live streaming scenario, but there's so much more that they unlock by buying that add on."

            "content": "Thanks Rick. As 2020 showed us a lot that happens in this world is outside of our control. Against that backdrop Axon employees really showed up engage their best in the areas that matter the most. I want to give an emphatic thanks to all of our employees. Thank you. At Axon, we've built an amazing team and that talent is a huge asset and competitive advantage that doesn't show up on the balance sheet. Our team is laser-focused on a clear mission inspired by our purpose and leaning in with an owner's mindset with a maniacal focus on delivering value for our customers. In 2020, we focus on our commitment to the mission to our customers and the caring for the health and safety of our employees. In 2020, Axon was able to outperform in a difficult year, because we built a phenomenal team. Looking to the future our company has the talent, infrastructure and capabilities to manage challenging environments and thrive. The company earned this position over three decades by taking risks, making bold decisions, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development, countless hours of engineering, tens of thousands of hours of customer meetings, and most importantly, maintaining an unfaltering commitment to our mission. As we look to 2021, we have four key objectives: one, grow the core; two, scale new products; three, unlock new markets; and four, drive efficiency to fuel growth. We're also taking care of the amazing team that we've built. Our employees' health and growth remains a top priority. We recently added Ginger, a Mental Health app providing 24/7 support to our employees as well as rolled out Linkedin Learning to the entire company. In 2021, we will continue to look for ways to support our working parents and caregivers. In 2021 and we'll continue to invest in our people, products and sales channels helping individuals level up, aim higher and push harder to make our mission a reality. I'll close out by talking about one of the areas of added investment, which allows us to go after a $2 billion total addressable market and that is our investment in virtual reality training. As a former military officer, I saw how the DODs near unlimited budget can create amazing training like markdowns filled with thousands of Arabic speaking actors, huge multi group training, as well as unmatched simulator training with pilot used for flight training. In law enforcement though, they don't have the luxury of these enormous budgets or the benefit of having the majority of their time available to train. With virtual reality, we can leverage the best-in-class instructors and training to create scenarios that can be used across hundreds of thousands of officers bringing the cost down to a very economical price that can democratize training and action is poised to be a leader in creating this new category just like we've done with the TASER devices, our Axon Body cameras, our digital \u2013 system Evidence.com. And we're going to do it again with the virtual reality training. In 2021, we intend to transform how agencies train our officers by addressing the inefficiencies around the classroom, full playing and simulator train and by leveraging VR, we can address their two biggest issues, budget and time. We'll accomplish this through three assets: First, we have an exciting product launch that we can't say more on but it is coming soon; second, we intend to regularly release new training modules; and third, we are doubling down on our community engagement training preform. We're seeing encouraging signs on demand for this product and we're excited about where it can go. Earlier I talked about the amazing team and culture we've built at Axon. Before I hand it over to our CFO, Jawad Ahsan, you want to learn more about that culture. I recommend you check out his book What They Didn't Tell Me, you can get it on Amazon. So with that let me turn it over to our CFO, Jawad Ahsan. Yes. Well we're seeing a lot of interest from our customers specifically around the entire kind of Axon portfolio where we see the biggest adoption of these capabilities is in our officer safety plans that we offer. I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Kunins to add a little more color on the specific product details. We've got decades of experience producing our TASER devices where ICAR is restricted, which means we have to manufacture in the US. And so we feel really, really good about that process. On the camera side, it's something that we definitely keep an eye on. As it sits today, we still feel really, really good with the way that we manufacture and then kind of load the final firmware on the product. And so, I don't see anything from kind of the supply chain side, I would defer to Josh, if he's hearing anything from the customers. Yes. Thanks for the question. Our consumer business doubled in revenues year-over-year 2020 over 2019. And some of that early in the year was the pandemic and some of the just overall lift in firearm sales and we were certainly a beneficiary of that. We did put a new general manager of the consumer business in place around second quarter last year and he's really up leveled our game. He is a marketing background, Matt Goren. He's got a very strong background in marketing and he's tried to move things for us. It actually had a very immediate effect and we've seen that momentum continue into 2021, which is how we know it's not a fluke. We've got some pretty lofty goals for the consumer business. We've got two new products that we're bringing to market by the end of this year. And longer term our ambition as a company is still to make the bullet of sleep and that doesn't just happen with building a better TASER device for law enforcement. We're planning on building a consumer device that also does the same thing. And then I want to turn it over to Rick and let him talk a little bit about his vision as well."

            "name": "Jawad Ahsan",
            "content": "Thanks, Luke. I want to start by talking about the number 28. I'm now referring to the number of days in this month, but rather three important milestones we hit as a company this quarter. We delivered 28% growth on revenue over 2019. 28% compound annual growth in revenue over the last five years and we finished the year with 28% in adjusted EBITDA margins. Now before I dive deeper into these, I want to talk about something else, the perception of our two business segments. We've discussed with you at great length, the investments we've been making in our pivot to a tech-enabled solutions company. The perception of our software and Sensors segment is best described by letting the numbers speak for themselves. Year-over-year, total revenues in this segment grew 26% and our ARR grew 37%. When I joined Axon in 2017 and our stock price was at $22, many investors told me that they viewed our stock as appropriately valuing our TASER device business with a free option on a high-growth software business. I think it's safe to say that we're now seeing some value in our stock price for our software business. But what about that TASER devices segment, the one that's been around since 1993? Was there maybe a perception that its best days are behind it? If so, we shattered that perception with our 2020 results. Our TASER Weapons segment grew revenues 30% year-over-year, outpacing even our fast-growing software and sensors segment. We're very proud of the TASER energy devices that we've built. And believe that there's still a large base of untapped customers who have yet to adopt. So the 28% revenue growth over 2019 was really fueled by strength across the board in body-worn cameras and software and especially in TASER devices. We feel that this validates our strategy to invest aggressively in both R&D and channel expansion. R&D to stay ahead of the innovation curve in all of our product segments and channel investments that will unlock new markets and new geographies. We're going to run this play again in 2021. When we look back over the past five years and the 28% CAGR on revenue, that's also the result of investments we've been making along similar lines. As we look ahead to the next five years, we're very excited by the next wave of new products and technologies that are going to become an important part of our growth story in their own right. Technologies like VR, which Luke just talked about earlier and we feel can have a transformative impact on the critical area of training for law enforcement. Technologies like Axon Respond in our live streaming platform. What's particularly exciting with this one is the interest we're seeing outside of our core law enforcement market. For example, coronavirus in the vaccine rollout is top of mind for communities all over the world. A municipal security unit in Chile has been trialing Axon Respond live streaming to ensure the quality and security of the supply chain and transportation process for COVID-19 vaccine distribution in their community. Another technology we're excited about is our new ERP and CRM. Many people across Axon are working incredibly hard on upgrading these critical support systems and their associated processes, and they're already driving huge efficiencies as the early modules come online. Luke also talked about the importance of driving efficiencies to fuel growth. And we're laying the foundation today for a company that will be able to scale to $1 billion in revenue and well beyond. Now you might be wondering why am, I choosing to highlight our new ERP along with sexier technologies like VR and live streaming. And I'm doing it to highlight something I can sum-up in one word, discipline. We have our sight set on some lofty goals by 2030, as Rick mentioned, but our feet are firmly planted in the here and now. I'm so proud of the discipline we exhibit as a company on a day-to-day basis. In our capital allocation decisions, our budgeting, our execution. This is a team that is absolutely dialed in and ready to build on our momentum. And take our company to even greater heights. And with that, we're going to turn it over to questions. Yes, I'll take this one. Jeremy, it's a good question. We are not expecting any margin drag from the new products that we're launching. We're actually expecting some margin expansion. In 2020, we were looking at some of the headwinds that we had on TASER. We also had some customer mix as far as international shipments and that's behind us. And so in this year even with the new products we're launching. For some of the newer ones specifically like VR, there's a little bit of a drag from a hardware perspective, but it's so small as so as to be negligible. Overall, we're not expecting any drag. Andrea, I actually might piggyback on that from an EBITDA standpoint for guidance, just how you should think about that provide some more context. So ever since I joined Axon, it's been really important to me that we're demonstrating both growth on our top line as well as driving leverage on our bottom line. And we've not only done exactly that over the last few years, but it's also been a central tenet of our long-term guidance as you know. So it's super important to us that we're continuing to invest to stay ahead of the innovation curve. That's another sort of thing that we're trying to solve for. So every year we put together an operating plan or a budget that's trying to solve for those three things; top line growth driving leverage and investing for growth. And it's actually super hard to do, but we've got a very talented management team and that's what we've been doing. However, one of the dynamics as Josh pointed out of our business is that our revenue profile throughout the year is back-half weighted. And even then it's really more concentrated in Q4 than in Q3. So what happens is if we hit our revenue targets, our EBITDA comes in on plan on our internal plan. And we drive that a little bit of incremental margin expansion while still having invested in things like R&D or the channel, but if we beat our revenue targets especially in the fourth quarter, it's too late in the year to reinvest that upside. So we return it to shareholders, which is exactly what you saw this past quarter. So that's how you should be thinking about it from an EBITDA standpoint Keith, our base plan is solving for top line growth, incremental leverage and investing for growth. And to the extent that we exceed on the top line that will allow us to drive even more leverage. Yeah, Josh why don't you weigh in. That was all TASER 7."

And you may have a lot of calls to go through. So I thought about how can I best encapsulate the quarter. Out over 1,000 people busting themselves, working so hard in the hardest environment I've ever seen. And then that team, they deserve that we spike the ball. I couldn't be more proud of what our team turned in. Now with that I also know some of you are working from home. We had the pleasure of meeting some of your kids. We want this to be the conference call that your kids want to come join. So at the end have them join you when you ask questions, and we'll send them some Axon Swag for warming up our call. I've got my daughter, Kyle who's learning about business. Say hi to everybody. So Kyle is going to be attending as well. She will be giving me pointers from the side as we go over our results. So thanks, Kyle. At the end we're also going to -- we're going to have a little bit of background bingo. You guys enjoyed it last time. So today we're going to play a little game, but we know you're busy. So let's get started, just hang out for the end and every kids join us. I cannot be more proud of what has happened with this company, how we've transformed and scaled in recent years. An idea that really started from a tragedy 27 years ago has had us put together platform and solutions that are at the center of today's national conversation around justice, equality and social reform. Our mission has been clear from day one. It's a privilege to be solving essential problems for our customers and for our communities. We see our customers out there working hard to keep communities safe. And we thank you. We thank them for their dedication. Communities are increasingly demanding not just body cameras, but also TASER devices that they see more and more often police need options to reduce incidents escalating to legal courts. On the heels of the extensive civil unrest we've seen over the past several months, Axon established a fourth company mission, a pillar, which I talked about last quarter centering on racial equity, diversity and inclusion. Our teams are greatly inspired by this new mission and joined forces to develop a new company-wide initiative Sprint for Justice led by Jeff Kunins, our CPO. Our entire engineering team came together in one enormously successful and productive two weeks sprint they created and shipped eight new capabilities in support of Axon's new goal. We have prominently highlighted these in a graphic within our Q3 shareholder letter and you can link from the front page of our website. Another big call out this quarter, significant traction in federal where bookings were up 400% compared to last year. We're establishing a strong foothold in the early innings here with big wins across new customers and programs. We've been making strategic investments into the U.S. federal market and we view this early success as a game changer. And with that I'd like to introduce you to the game-changing person who's behind this. And that is Richard Coleman, our Vice President and General Manager of Federal programs. Richard came to us from General Dynamics where he started out as a Solutions Architect for Department of Defense Geosynchronous Satellite Programs, he progressed to capture management where we won multiple $100 million and $1 billion programs. We certainly hope he'll be doing that with us here. And he finally finished his General Dynamics 18-year career as a Vice President and GM for Law Enforcement Systems. Richard?\nRichard Coleman: Hi. Thanks, Rick. Really appreciate it. Now, I am thrilled to join you all for today's call. This quarter will mark my second year here at Axon, and I've never been more bullish on the opportunity we have in front of us in the federal market. Q3 2020 marks a historic moment for Axon as we've achieved a record $38 million in bookings up 400% year-over-year. Our success includes a number of new programs and contracts, many of which were first for Axon. I'll walk through five of these quickly to provide some color, but these are also in the shareholder letter as well. First, we established our first two programs of record with the federal government, including a $13 million U.S. Customs and Border Protection order for body cameras and digital evidence management. This is significant because, Customs and Border Protection is the largest law enforcement agency within the U.S., and if you're not familiar with the program of record, it's a key milestone that specifies an appropriations line in the U.S. discretionary budget. Second, we signed our first indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity or IDIQ contract with a federal agency directly. To be successful in the federal market and federal space, it's essential to establish contacts and contracts to get your solutions funded. And an IDIQ is a contract vehicle that does just that for us. Additionally, it gives the agency an established way to procure our solutions through an established vehicle. Third, we signed our first Officer Safety Plan for the federal agency. A lot of you are familiar with our OSP plans. It's a bundle that includes TASER 7, Axon Body three and all the software that goes along with it. And we're excited to take this popular bundle and introduce it to the federal law enforcement market as well. Fourth, we sold body cams and cloud-based digital evidence management for the first Department of Defense customers. And we think there's much, much more opportunity to unlock in the DoD starting with the military police and security forces across the department. And lastly, we signed our largest TASER contract in company history. It's valued at $15.5 million with the Department of Homeland Security. Now with all that said, all these achievements there's one thing that really excites me most about Federal and it is that Axon is already an established tech comp, known for its innovation. And we can leverage our innovation, our tech pedigree, along with our top-notch products to fill real federal requirements immediately to fill them today in the federal market. And we can do this, while still innovating like the tech company we are. And we can drive the industry as well as the federal market forward. Again, I really want to thank you all for the time today on today's call. I'm both humbled and honored to have the opportunity to lead Axon Federal into the federal market. And in doing so, protecting life, capturing through and accelerating jet for the federal defense and civilian agencies and all the communities based there. So with that, back to Rick.\nRick Smith: Awesome. Thank you, Richard. It's been just a real pleasure having you on our team and your impact has been remarkable as demonstrated this past quarter. I want to conclude my segment by thanking our employees. Look, we're all going a little stir crazy working from home in this wild turbulent 2020. And I just think about the mental toughness and commitment that people have summoned this year to work through it and deliver the kind of results this team is delivering. It's not lost on me that, we are in a fortunate position despite the fact that we're in the midst of a global pandemic, we've been blessed that we have superior talent across the organization, we have mission-critical products and we're finding new and increasing pathways to growth and a powerful financial model. And with that, I want to turn it over to our President, Luke Larson.\nLuke Larson: Thanks, Rick. There are so many great things to talk about from Axon Accelerate our user conference to our massive early success in the U.S. federal market that Richard talked about to the strength of the demand for our software services and our Officer Safety Plan subscription and the phenomenal adoption we're seeing. We detailed a lot of it in our shareholder letter. So to avoid being too repetitive, I just want to highlight just two of the many successes from this quarter. First, TASER. We're not just selling TASER devices anymore. The category is evolving from a book and ship hardware product to a subscription-based deescalation platform that includes cloud software and training. And we see this in the percentage of TASER devices sold on a subscription, which rose to a record 75% this quarter. This 75% reflects a surge in demand for TASER in the U.S. Internationally, we are still getting started. And so while subscription levels are lower than in the U.S., we are confident, we can also drive subscriptions abroad. Second, we launched Axon Respond, which is a giant leap in police communications technology. We are evolving real-time situational awareness beyond the radio. Going back two years, we spent more than 1000 hours studying what was wrong with 911 operations. So we could deliver a compelling solution to fix it. Rather than describe it, we're going to play the video that we showed at Axon Accelerate. Most of the technology you'll see in this video is in the market today with a few exceptions including fleet three with license plate reading which we are aiming to bring to market mid-next year. Doug can you play the video?  [Video Presentation] Awesome. And one last shout out for me to all of our employees that helped deliver these record results. And with that I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer Jawad. \nJawad Ahsan: Thanks Luke. I'm also very proud of our employees for putting up another quarter of solid execution which drove outperformance across most of our metrics. Earlier this year, we shared our plans to invest in our channel product and support infrastructure as we look to scale the business to $1 billion in revenue and beyond. These investments yielded results ahead of our expectations as evidenced by our strength in outlook for 2020. We intend to continue these types of investments in 2021. Two areas in particular highlight how we think about calibrating our investments for growth in a dual track near and long strategy. With certain channel investments such as federal and international, we can start to unlock revenue relatively quickly in the near term.  Meanwhile with other investments particularly in our software product categories such as records and dispatch we're bringing new products to market that will disrupt legacy incumbent providers over the long term. This combination of right-sized investments ensures growth over the near and long term and with growing diversification the particular product or channel that drives this growth will look different from quarter to quarter. Now let's turn to our outlook. For 2020, we believe we can deliver full year revenue of $630 million to $640 million. The out-performance versus our original 2020 revenue midpoint expectation of $620 million reflects strength across the business as well as growing customer diversification particularly in federal and international. As you see in our shareholder letter we're also tracking above plan on the bottom line and that's driven by revenue out-performance expense leverage in travel and event cost savings of about $12 million. In 2021, we expect to continue to build on our strong momentum. Given the rapid pace of growth we're seeing, we want to provide you with a framework around our view of the business. Since our August update, we've seen an uptick in our level of visibility. While there is some risk from the ongoing impacts of COVID most municipal budgets for January have been set. And after taking into account some small pockets of budget slowdown, we feel confident in our positioning and outlook heading into next year. In addition, we're continuing to diversify in products and markets. Our initial view of the business for next year is for $720 million to $750 million in revenue with $120 million to $130 million in adjusted EBITDA. This reflects continued strength on the top line and consistent adjusted EBITDA margin performance excluding the aforementioned $12 million of expense favorability in 2020 due to the pandemic. Finally I want to touch on ESG which we're hearing about from a growing number of our investors. Axon is a mission-driven company whose overarching goal is to protect life and that social mission is what drew many of us to the company. We see fully 100% of our revenues as supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In our shareholder letter we talk about Sprint for Justice which Rick mentioned earlier. This product development initiative created features such as automatically flagging body camera video, if a racial slur is detected using VR training to help officers better respond to high-stake situations and promoting a growth mindset among officers by offering a coaching feature. ESG is a growing area of focus for us and you can expect to see more from us on this front over the coming year. We're in the final stretch of a high-performance year. I want to reiterate, how proud I am of our employees for their crisp execution in a challenging environment and for their unwavering support of our customers. As we plan for 2021 we feel highly confident about how we're positioned across the board. And with that, Andrea let's move to questions. \nAndrea James: Thank you, Jawad and team. Moderators, can you bring everybody up into gallery view? Let me know when that happens please. \nOperator: We're all up in gallery view. \nA - Andrea James: Great. Thank you. All right. We're going to take our first question from Keith Housum at Northcoast. Go ahead Keith, you're up. And the phrase of 2020 is you are on mute Keith. \nKeith Housum: All right. Can you hear me now? Sorry about that guys. Jawad, can you go in a little bit more detail and remind us about the investments that are going to be made in the channel the product and the infrastructure. I guess, particularly, I'm interested in some of the investments you're going to be making to grow the international business. \nJawad Ahsan: Yes, absolutely. So we made investments this year in new geographies that we had never been in before. And it was really on the heels of investments we made in the previous years in new markets like India and the Ukraine. We have seen very early -- like great results early on. I'm going to let Josh talk a little bit more about that. When we put boots on the ground, there's no substitute for that. And what we found is that by having folks there by establishing offices having employees, Axon employees in these new markets it leads to not only increase pipeline, but in many cases a return within the same year. And so we're doubling down on that strategy, the channel investments next year we're going to expand even more geographies. From a product standpoint we're continuing to invest very heavily in software. The Sprint for Justice initiative that Jeff led with his team this year is a great example of just the type of leverage that we could expect to see from the investments we've already made in our product and just a little bit of extra effort goes a long way. And then from the support infrastructure standpoint, we are in the process of getting ready to be $1 billion-plus revenue company and everything that comes along with it from an ERP implementation, which we're well underway in HRIS and other back-office support systems that we're putting in place to help the company scale. \nKeith Housum: Great. And if I can follow-up on that. In terms of the international expansion is -- are all the entire product portfolio going to be available internationally? So I guess what I'm getting at is the software been written or translatable into any language? Or are you going to be limited in terms of what you can offer where based on languages? \nJeff Kunins: Ultimately, I think, we view any international customer as an opportunity to not only sell TASERs and body cams, but also move them to the cloud and Evidence.com. And for some markets right off the bat customers are adopting Evidence.com. For other markets they're adopting our on-premise solution named Commander first and then subsequently moving to Evidence.com over time. I think for us the most important thing for any international customer is to get one of our products in their hands. And it really doesn't necessarily matter to us which one they start with because we can really feel confident betting on ourselves that we'll be able to deploy more and more of our products with those same customers over time. \nKeith Housum: Okay. So language will not be a barrier to what country you can go with your product portfolio? \nJeff Kunins: No. \nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks, guys. Great quarter. \nJeff Kunins: Thank you. \nAndrea James: Thanks Keith. All right. So we're going to take our next question from Will Power at Baird. Go ahead, Will. \nWill Power: Great. Yes. Thanks for taking question. I guess, I'll try to slip in two. Maybe the first for Richard or perhaps Rick whoever wants to take it. Really encouraging to see the progress at federal. I guess, I'd just love to get a little more color on what the sales cycles look like generally as you target federal, particularly, as you look at that Homeland Security contract the largest TASER deal in company's history. And I guess, I'd be curious how much more room there might be to go with somebody like Homeland Security? Is this just a starting point? Or are there things you could build off of from here? \nRick Smith: Why don't you take that one Richard? \nRichard Coleman: Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. The lead times for federal contracts can vary. Typically there's a two-year budgeting cycle. But that said, every single year federal customers are evaluating what the gaps are, what their needs are and their requirements. And so every single year a customer has the opportunity to leverage their funding for technology and/or capabilities that are relevant. And so we're seeing lead times as low as within a year as well as extending out to the two years that the budgeting cycle typically efforts itself. And then specifically for Customs and Border Protection, CBP they are the largest law enforcement agency across the U.S. So 40,000 law enforcement officers within Customs and Border Protection so we see this as a franchise program where we see nowhere but north and additional growth.\nWill Power: Okay. Great. And maybe a question for Jawad, it was great to see some initial thoughts on 2020. Maybe just help us out the key insights from your end to help what was your confidence in laying out that revenue guidance what were kind of the key inputs to provide that visibility at this point particularly given some of the ongoing questions with respect to municipal budgets and whatnot. \nJawad Ahsan: Yes. Of course, look, one of our core values as a company is transparency. We've got great relationships with our investors and our analysts and we've always prided ourselves on the level of information, and detail that we share in helping them model our business. One of the things that, we heard pretty consistently throughout 2020 was that after we pulled our guidance earlier this year it was a little difficult to model our business. We've got a lot of moving parts and increasing amount of complexity in the business. And as you point out, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world. But the reality is that our business has been diversifying along two vectors. Who we sell to is rapidly expanding beyond law enforcement and where we sell is rapidly expanding beyond the U.S. So the fact is that our business is more resilient today than it's ever been. And so we wanted to share our view on how 2021 is lining up for us again in an effort to help folks model our business. \nWill Power: Okay. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Will. Next question from Erik Lapinski at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Erik.\nErik Lapinski: Sorry, I think I was on mute. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks. Maybe just a quick one on kind of as you continue to ramp shipments of Body 3. Can you give us any context into just the attach rate for maybe some of the more LTE connected features and kind of the usage there? Is it going up pretty in line with what you would have expected? Is it may be improving better or worse?\nRick Smith: Yes. Absolutely. I think we're very, very excited about where we're at right now with interest in live streaming and other connected features with a AB3. Without going too deep into the numbers, I would say, like we feel really good about the amount of adoption we've seen through 10 or 11 months here and certainly going into next year have a very strong pipeline of connected services. Whenever you launch a new product and really at any point in the year customers need some time to build in that ask into their budget. And so while this year a lot of our new cameras that were first time purchases included a lot of the connected services. Going into next year, I think a big point of focus for us in kind of year two of those budget cycles are now to be able to get all those upgraded cameras on those same connected plans. And our customers have been working with us and of course with their city councils and so forth to identify funding to add those feature sets on. And so we're really excited about kind of the runway we have to get hopefully one day every single AB3 onto our Respond or Respond Plus platforms. \nErik Lapinski: Got it. Thank you. \nLuke Larson: And just one quick addition to that, as we talked about in the shareholder letter both from a sales perspective, but also just usage and engagement while it's still early days over 200 agencies have used Aware actively in the last 30 days with more than two dozen consistently using it every single week now. And we've seen just tremendous growth in the adoption of live streaming as it begins to roll out. We've seen it grow over 6x over the past six months. \nErik Lapinski: Got it. That's awesome. Thanks. And then maybe just one other one on kind of the percentage of TASERs sold on a subscription going up. Is that starting to become more, I guess, being the highest rate you've seen. Was that some of that a factor of maybe a large order to being sold on subscription? Or like is that pacing to even the rate that you would expect kind of moving forward?\nRick Smith: Ultimately, the majority of TASER 7s are on subscription plans the vast majority. And so essentially, the way I think about it is over time as the mix of T7s keeps going up relative to our other TASERs the more of that number will be driven up as well. So I certainly would expect although nothing is guaranteed that we would look for that number to keep growing unless there's like an outsized international order as a one-time purchase or an outsized order on X2 or X26P is a onetime purchase we certainly would expect that number to keep trending up.\nErik Lapinski: Got it. Thank you.\nAndrea James: And just to be clear to follow up there. It was also tied to the mix of domestic shipments in the quarter. So 75% is a great number and we're proud of it but it will fluctuate depending on domestic versus international. Okay. Our next question is going to be from Joe Osha at JMP Securities. Go ahead, Joe.\nJoe Osha: Okay. Am I unmuted? That's the first and most important question. Going back to some of the comments about next year I'm wondering if we could maybe get some insight into how that might break down in terms of TASER sales versus cloud. And then also I'm interested in whether computer-automated dispatch and records might be contributing meaningfully to that? Thanks.\nRick Smith: Yes. We definitely have goals across all products including dispatch and records. And certainly we've seen a lot of really promising indicators in terms of interest and commitments this year that will translate into deployments and dollars next year in dispatch and records. And then on the TASER business I think as we look at next year we kind of try to set a goal for ourselves of how much we want the TASER business to grow year-over-year. And absolutely, we anticipate TASER growth in that number. But likewise we expect all segments to grow including software and sensors, cloud and so forth. \nJoe Osha: Could I perhaps, Jawad are you willing to put some numbers around that in terms of mix? \nJawad Ahsan: Not at this time, Joe. We gave directional guidance for how we're thinking about 2021 and we feel good about that guidance today but that's the extent of the detail we're going to get into.\nJoe Osha: Okay. Thank you.\nAndrea James: You always got to try right? You got to try. I'm just checking to see who's logged in recently because we've had some folks logging in up. Let's take our next question from Jonathan Ho at William Blair. Go ahead, Jonathan.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon and congrats on the strong quarter. I just wanted to start off by circling back to the Fed opportunities. Does the IDIQ contract potentially give you a hunting license to go and maybe chase other agencies or subagencies down? And just wanted to get your thoughts around the GSA schedule as well.\nRick Smith: Yes. Go ahead, Richard.\nRichard Coleman: Absolutely. Yes. So an IDIQ contract it is kind of a hunting license. You can think of it as a contract vehicle that allows the customer -- the federal customer to buy off of a pre-agreed icing catalog from Axon. And so in particular this IDIQ has multiple -- is at the department level and there's multiple agencies within that department that can then follow on and purchase off of IDIQ. \nJonathan Ho: Great. And then we've definitely seen some interest here in terms of the deescalation products. Can you maybe talk a little bit about whether that can potentially drive some additional bundling and just sort of the reception that you've seen from deescalation just given the current political environment? Thanks.\nRick Smith: Yes sure. So in Q2, obviously with the lockdowns and so forth that was domestically probably the low point of the year in TASER sales. And Q3 we really roared back and I'm so proud of our entire global team, especially in this case our state and local team. And I think there is certainly a record interest in TASERs. We see that quarter-over-quarter here. And we expect that to continue to grow both in state and local where we see it more incrementally. And then federal and international where our hope is we see it more exponentially. And so across the board I think there is very strong demand for TASERs. I think you'll continue to see that throughout the year here and we're very excited at the opportunity to continue to be able to package our deescalation devices with our software and sensors, packages on the body cam, cloud side and on the record side and so forth. \nAndrea James: Okay. Thanks, guys. We'll take our next question from Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum. Go ahead, Jeremy. You're on mute.\nJeremy Hamblin: Can you hear me now? Sorry about that. So I wanted to just congratulations on the fantastic results. I wanted to get into the records business a little bit. And just get a sense of -- there's a little bit more embedded competition in that particular side of your business. And I wanted to get a sense for -- as you're getting in the initial ramp the timeframes to win meaningful share in that portion of your business.  You have fantastic relationships now that have been built over a couple of decades that may make the sell easier, but I wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about that business and whether or not the ramp that we saw that was kind of a long slog in cameras, do you think that this -- you can potentially gain share and adoption faster and record simply because of the extensive relationships you have today? \nJosh Isner: Absolutely, Jeremy. I think we've seen over the last 10 years certainly body cameras were a little slower out of the gate to be adopted. But now we've put ourselves in a market leadership position there. And certainly part of our strategy as we've talked about is around OSP 7 plus and packaging our record solutions with our body camera solutions. I'd say this about the competition like we have a lot of respect for all the different companies in the market. They're all great companies and well run and so forth.  But at the same time like we've built our team and our channel and our product team and our company for moments like this where we can enter new markets and we can win in them. And so this year, we've seen very promising results and I certainly believe in our team and I think we're going to end up in a spot where we are the market leaders not only in records, but also in dispatch and every day we're waking up getting one step closer to that. \nJeremy Hamblin: And if I could I wanted to ask one other question directed towards Jawad in thinking about 2021. In terms of -- you've seen pretty exceptional growth and steady growth now in the weapons side of the business. And I wanted to get a sense as we look forward into next year where you've continued to have mid-teens growth in that weapon segment. I think a lot of people had expected that to tamper. It seems as though you're as excited about that business today as you might have been a few years ago and maybe even more so. Is that something where you feel like that weapons portion of your business can continue to do double-digit growth? \nJawad Ahsan: Yes. It's a great way to say it Jeremy. I am more excited about our TASER business now than I ever have been in my time at Axon. Actually I've never felt better about the company overall. And obviously TASER is a big part of that. And we talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks about this like near and long strategy where in the near-term we can still see growth from TASER both domestically there's still life space. We talked about all the reasons why over the last couple of years. But now with federal and with international that's going to be an important growth vector for TASER.  And then with these investments we're making in product with records and dispatch, we think that that's going to be at -- those are SaaS businesses our ARR is now top $200 million. So we're not necessarily small anymore, but that's still ramping very quickly. And as that revenue comes online over the next few years that's going to help two, three, four years out. Keeping our growth rate growing at an accelerated pace. \nRick Smith: Yes. I've got to jump in here and say as well do not forget the TASER business. It is a really transformative and exciting business. Before this decade is out, we will have a weapon that is going to be neck-and-neck or even outperforming a 9-millimeter and stopping power. And I think we've got the opportunity to become the primary weapon of law enforcement officers around the world. And that message has been really positively received by law enforcement.  When I released my book last year, we were nervous as to how that investment would resonate. But I can tell you especially in the environment we're in right now no officer wants to use legal force. And we just -- we've got a really good less lethal weapon system today, but we still have room to improve and I'm really excited about the things that are coming down the road. And just the opportunity even with TASER 7 just got approved in the U.K. I mean we're getting approved in new markets where our existing upgrades are going to be really opening a lot of revenue opportunity. And I don't see that coming out of scheme -- running out of a scheme any time soon. \nJawad Ahsan: I actually I wanted to jump back in as well one thing you haven't heard us talk a lot about I'm just as excited as Rick is talking about TASER. One area, we haven't talked a lot about in the past, but I think you're going to start hearing more from us Jeremy is the consumer business. So I'm just so part of our consumer team. We had a plan for the year -- for the full year in revenue and they hit that plan in the first seven months of the year. They're having a banner year. We're expecting big things from that business. We've got a couple of product launches in the horizon in the next year or two. So, that's another area that we're expecting to see some growth.\nJeremy Hamblin: Fantastic, I love the goal. Thanks guys.\nAndrea James: Thank you. Next question from Joshua Reilly at Needham. Go ahead, Joshua.\nJoshua Reilly: Hey, there. Thanks for taking my questions. So you just had your customer conference in August. What did you see in terms of demand and pipeline generation out of that event from being fully virtual versus historical in person events? And then, how does that compare to the increased customer interest generated from the social unrest over the summer?\nRick Smith: So let me start, and then I'll pass over to Josh, who is here. I would say overall, being virtual the level of attendance I think we had something like 10,000 people sign-up, which is something like 4x or 5x in last year. Now not all of them showed up and the level of engagement probably wasn't as high, because we didn't have their undivided attention. But the feedback we got was people really enjoyed it. We set out VR headsets loaded with some of the content for at least a subset of the attendees. So I think given the challenges, people really responded well. Now we do see the value of in-person in the future. But this year, I think actually in terms of quantity of touch, it was actually broader than it's been before just maybe not as deep in terms of giving their time for three full days. Josh, do you want to add on anything?\nJosh Isner: Just to the questions about social unrest. Look like I want to be really conscious of how we talk about this. It's not a victory when there's the type of social unrest that there is today. And so, certainly like our team, I think we think about our sales process the exact same way every day, like we are going to cover the market well. We're going to talk about the value that our products provide across the board and we really, really believe in that value. And sometimes it takes an external factor for a customer to maybe be more motivated to buy it or whatever the case may be. But we really believe like hey we're just going to keep focusing on the things we can control, and we believe we're going to end up in a really positive place not only as a business but in terms of fulfilling our goals and missions in society. I think we're going to feel really good about that. And I want to kick it over to Luke, maybe just to talk a little more about Accelerate as well. I think he had something to say as well. Thanks.\nLuke Larson: Yes. Accelerate was a huge success in terms of being able to connect with the customers digitally which I think a year ago it would have been very tough to get the key decision-makers from major cities to invest in time via Zoom call or another format. And so that's been one of the silver linings of the pandemic is us being able to rapidly push people to these virtual-type engagements. And so we walked away being very, very pleased to Rick's point of being able to hit a larger number of customers, and showcasing all of the tools around deescalation transparency. And then, just finally to Josh's point on the social rest -- social unrest, we really are trying to solve and be part of the solution in these really difficult complex situations. And so our customers aren't looking to us as somebody that's coming to them out of the blue. We've invested in decades of relationships where they know the tools that we're creating are going to help them resolve these really difficult issues in the best possible outcome.\nJoshua Reilly: Okay, great. And then, just one follow-up question. Net revenue retention increased one point sequentially in the quarter. Does that imply that you're having ongoing success in upselling the OSP bundles? I know that's probably the case, but just maybe some color on that. And then, how should we think about the relative penetration for OSP at this point within the body cam customer base?\nRick Smith: Yes. I'll take the first part of that question on net retention. That's exactly right. Our strategy has been geared towards selling more higher-value-added bundles like OSP 7 Plus. And as more customers adopt that then we should expect -- we will expect to see our net retention increase. And then for the second part of your question, I'm going to kick it over to Josh.\nJosh Isner: Okay. So, on the net revenue retention, I also just want to give a big shout out to our customer success or this is an order we invested and substantially this year to build this out and make sure our customers continue to have a great experience. And Lisa Krolikowski and her team have just done an awesome job ensuring that. And I think that's reflected in net revenue retention. Do you mind just reminding me of the second part of that question?\nJoshua Reilly: I was just about to -- sorry, did I just cut out there. The relative penetration for OSP plans within the body cam customer base.\nJosh Isner: Yes. So I think for us, like, with OSP right now, I think, we're seeing a lot of midsize and larger agencies start to show a lot of interest in it. And I think that's where we're having the most success. As we kind of took a holistic look at our pricing and packaging strategy going into next year, I think, you'll start to see us test OSP like offerings that are a little more tailored to specific segments. So in corrections, I think, we're very excited to offer an OSP package there that's more tailored to corrections. I think with inside sales that handle our smaller customers, we're going to be experimenting there as well with the same type of package that's a little more tailored for smaller agencies. So our goal is to have every customer buy a camera, a software license, a records license and a TASER at the same time. And I think we're on our way to that. And hopefully, with some of the adjustments and tailoring types of initiatives that we're undertaking right now, I think, we'll continue to see more and more positive signs there.\nRick Smith: One thing, before we continue, Andrea, I'm going to go ahead and just take one moment and I'm going to share my screen. And I'm demonstrating with you guys a feedback tool I use with a lot of our customer interactions it's called Slido. And it is a way that I can take feedback from groups of customers, while I'm doing these calls. So I want to do the same thing with you. If you get out your smartphone and go to slido.com and enter the code Axon or just point your smartphone camera at the QR code, that will open up Slido for you. And there we're going to get some of your feedback and you can ask some questions there that I can come to at the end. And while we're doing that, Andrea, back to you to keep running with the questions.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Rick. Thanks. All right. We're going to take our next question. Moderators, can you bring everyone on to gallery view again?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. Can you stop sharing your screen there? \nRick Smith: Did I break it? All right. Do I need to stop my screen share, Doug? \nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes, if you could. \nRick Smith: Okay. \nAndrea James: Thank you, Rick. Appreciate that. Okay. So next question from Charlie Anderson at Colliers. Charlie, you\u2019re up.\nCharlie Anderson: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a really strong quarter. I wanted to go back to the consumer TASER commentary; that was really interesting. Sort of, curious what's happening there. Is that more push? Is that more pull, because it is finally in the same product, right? And I'm sort of curious too, if it's a sustainable trend, what that means to TASER gross margin and then also the cartridge business for TASER. And then, I've got a follow-up.\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. Great question, Charlie. It's a little bit of both. Earlier in the year we saw increased sales from the -- as a side effect of folks staying home and wanting more self-defense options. As you know, like, gun sales were up and TASER sales were up for similar reasons, as folks looked for self-defense options for home. We hired a new general manager for the consumer business. He started earlier this year. He's got a fantastic marketing background and he's been completely up-leveling our game. As you pointed out, it's the same products, but we're really stepping up our game from a marketing standpoint and we've been making a run-in, not only increasing sales with distributors, but especially with direct-to-consumer. And those results have yielded some pretty great returns early on. Next year, as I mentioned, we're looking at a couple of product launches that I think are going to get even more of a push. And we're focusing not only on the TASER form factor, but there are some other form factors that we think are very appealing to folks that don't necessarily want to fire a weapon, per se, but more of a TASER that's got a different form factor like we've had in the past that we've discontinued. So those types of things we think are going to be opening up new markets for us. And then, from a margin standpoint, they're actually going to be very helpful. The consumer business is at -- we haven't actually disclosed this publicly, but it's a very attractive margin. It's accretive to our law enforcement margins and that's true with the cartridges as well.\nCharlie Anderson: Okay, great. And then for my follow-up, we had a chance at some pretty significant police reform bills coming out of the federal government this year, didn't happen. I'm just sort of curious where you see attitudes trending as far as that's concerned, in terms of reform, both at the federal and at the state level, in terms of potential tailwinds to the business. Then NIBRS was obviously helpful on opening up opportunities in record, sort of, curious if there's anything else like that out there in terms of regulatory that can provide a tailwind for you guys over the next year or so? Thanks.\nRick Smith: Let me take that one. A few weeks ago, I had gotten an e-mail from a Republican U.S. Congressmen, who would inform me that part of their platform on police reform was to promote body cameras for every officer in America. And that's coming through the Republicans. I think you would also see on the Democratic side of the aisle that we're -- there's a lot of support for police reform particularly around body cameras. But I'll tell you once we really get into the conversation people also very quickly understand the value of TASER weapons. I mean we saw the tragedy in Philadelphia a few weeks ago and the community there has risen up including the family of the deceased really pushing the agency, why didn't every office there have a TASER. Again we obviously don't like to see those sort of tragedies happening or try to leverage them. But we do have solutions that really matter and we think it's bipartisan. And I would tell you I just -- on a personal note, I've been pretty worn out by all the devices missed in the country, but the last 48 hours, I was expecting a lot more of it. And I'm feeling a lot more -- a lot less division right now. I think we may see a more productive coming together as we move into next year after the exhaustion of 2020 and I think on both sides of the aisle. We have a positive solution-oriented technology program that can be part of a police reform bill that police want that communities want and I think legislators can see the value of them. So I'm optimistic. \nLuke Larson: Yes. I would just add -- I would echo Rick's comments. I think this is really -- we're seeing now bipartisan support for reform that would include technologies for products like body cameras, as well as increased training. In June, Joe Biden called for $300 million to reinvigorate community policing. And so regardless of the outcome I think this is an area where kind of the pragmatic voice is going to win in terms of saying we actually need more training to reform police more funds going in there than to actually cut funds from there. \nAndrea James: Okay guys. I think that's all of our questions. And I just want to give a quick second to make sure to see if we have any follow-ups. Does anybody have a follow-up? Do you want to raise your hand? No, we're feeling good. Okay so. \nRick Smith: Andrea a couple have come in through the chat real quick. I don't know if you want to just touch on those about the sales of body cams used by correctional guards and police officers. \nAndrea James: Go ahead Rick. Go ahead. \nRick Smith: I think we're seeing some major correctional agencies and sheriff's offices are now starting to deploy these. In fact Josh you could talk -- you stood up a team to go after these adjacent markets. And I think we're seeing real reception right? \nJosh Isner: Yes. Absolutely Rick. I think this is a place where historically there hasn't necessarily been a lot of focus on it in terms of like individuals that that's really all they do day in and day out. And over the last two years we've built that team and I think it's already presenting pretty incredible returns. And I think once these representatives go out and talk to customers I think they're really parlaying the success to the similar use cases around the country within corrections. And we expect that to continue I think between corrections and some of our other adjacent markets of private security and eventually fire and EMS and so forth. We'll continue to see more and more momentum both on the TASER side and on the body cam side. \nRick Smith: Right. And I think we already answered the other question that was in there. \nAndrea James: Yes. There was another question that chat about please, but I feel like we really covered that both in our shareholder letter in our prepared remarks and in the Q&A. And the transcript will be posted online if you guys missed something. Okay. So now we're going to turn it over to Rick to close this out. And just wanted to say one of the things that's really been heartwarming is, we've heard from some of you on the buy side that you're watching our earnings calls with your kids and they're learning about what you do managing assets for a living. So in that spirit of camaraderie, Rick prepared a little something for the families out there tuning into earnings calls. \nRick Smith: So you guys have already seen. In fact we've already had three people respond which I appreciate. I'm going to leave this up. The call is basically over. But if you get a chance go into Slido and check it out. It's been an invaluable tool. I get a lot of feedback from customers this way. And we're having some fun where if you can guess the majority of our backgrounds whether they're real or not what office it's from, we're going to send you some Swag. So give us your shirt size your email. And thanks and also give us your feedback. We want to know are you enjoying the format sometimes we get a little more informal. I figure you're probably going stir crazy like we are. So we're listening it up trying to make it kind of fun, knowing you've got a lot of work you're going to be working late in tonight. We hope you will look forward to our earnings call, not just for the great results, but because we're going to have all fun together. So thanks. It's good to see the country, I feel coming together. I have this optimism looking into the future. In general, it's been a rough year. And thanks for sticking with us. And again, to every Axon employee, I couldn't be more proud to be part of this team. I just love working with you all and look forward to reporting our next results in the New Year. So, thanks everybody.\nAndrea James: Thank you. Bye.",

            "name": "Richard Coleman",
            "content": "Hi. Thanks, Rick. Really appreciate it. Now, I am thrilled to join you all for today's call. This quarter will mark my second year here at Axon, and I've never been more bullish on the opportunity we have in front of us in the federal market. Q3 2020 marks a historic moment for Axon as we've achieved a record $38 million in bookings up 400% year-over-year. Our success includes a number of new programs and contracts, many of which were first for Axon. I'll walk through five of these quickly to provide some color, but these are also in the shareholder letter as well. First, we established our first two programs of record with the federal government, including a $13 million U.S. Customs and Border Protection order for body cameras and digital evidence management. This is significant because, Customs and Border Protection is the largest law enforcement agency within the U.S., and if you're not familiar with the program of record, it's a key milestone that specifies an appropriations line in the U.S. discretionary budget. Second, we signed our first indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity or IDIQ contract with a federal agency directly. To be successful in the federal market and federal space, it's essential to establish contacts and contracts to get your solutions funded. And an IDIQ is a contract vehicle that does just that for us. Additionally, it gives the agency an established way to procure our solutions through an established vehicle. Third, we signed our first Officer Safety Plan for the federal agency. A lot of you are familiar with our OSP plans. It's a bundle that includes TASER 7, Axon Body three and all the software that goes along with it. And we're excited to take this popular bundle and introduce it to the federal law enforcement market as well. Fourth, we sold body cams and cloud-based digital evidence management for the first Department of Defense customers. And we think there's much, much more opportunity to unlock in the DoD starting with the military police and security forces across the department. And lastly, we signed our largest TASER contract in company history. It's valued at $15.5 million with the Department of Homeland Security. Now with all that said, all these achievements there's one thing that really excites me most about Federal and it is that Axon is already an established tech comp, known for its innovation. And we can leverage our innovation, our tech pedigree, along with our top-notch products to fill real federal requirements immediately to fill them today in the federal market. And we can do this, while still innovating like the tech company we are. And we can drive the industry as well as the federal market forward. Again, I really want to thank you all for the time today on today's call. I'm both humbled and honored to have the opportunity to lead Axon Federal into the federal market. And in doing so, protecting life, capturing through and accelerating jet for the federal defense and civilian agencies and all the communities based there. So with that, back to Rick. Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. The lead times for federal contracts can vary. Typically there's a two-year budgeting cycle. But that said, every single year federal customers are evaluating what the gaps are, what their needs are and their requirements. And so every single year a customer has the opportunity to leverage their funding for technology and/or capabilities that are relevant. And so we're seeing lead times as low as within a year as well as extending out to the two years that the budgeting cycle typically efforts itself. And then specifically for Customs and Border Protection, CBP they are the largest law enforcement agency across the U.S. So 40,000 law enforcement officers within Customs and Border Protection so we see this as a franchise program where we see nowhere but north and additional growth. Absolutely. Yes. So an IDIQ contract it is kind of a hunting license. You can think of it as a contract vehicle that allows the customer -- the federal customer to buy off of a pre-agreed icing catalog from Axon. And so in particular this IDIQ has multiple -- is at the department level and there's multiple agencies within that department that can then follow on and purchase off of IDIQ."

            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "Thanks Andrea. I know everybody is really busy with earnings season. And you may have a lot of calls to go through. So I thought about how can I best encapsulate the quarter. Out over 1,000 people busting themselves, working so hard in the hardest environment I've ever seen. And then that team, they deserve that we spike the ball. I couldn't be more proud of what our team turned in. Now with that I also know some of you are working from home. We had the pleasure of meeting some of your kids. We want this to be the conference call that your kids want to come join. So at the end have them join you when you ask questions, and we'll send them some Axon Swag for warming up our call. I've got my daughter, Kyle who's learning about business. Say hi to everybody. So Kyle is going to be attending as well. She will be giving me pointers from the side as we go over our results. So thanks, Kyle. At the end we're also going to -- we're going to have a little bit of background bingo. You guys enjoyed it last time. So today we're going to play a little game, but we know you're busy. So let's get started, just hang out for the end and every kids join us. I cannot be more proud of what has happened with this company, how we've transformed and scaled in recent years. An idea that really started from a tragedy 27 years ago has had us put together platform and solutions that are at the center of today's national conversation around justice, equality and social reform. Our mission has been clear from day one. It's a privilege to be solving essential problems for our customers and for our communities. We see our customers out there working hard to keep communities safe. And we thank you. We thank them for their dedication. Communities are increasingly demanding not just body cameras, but also TASER devices that they see more and more often police need options to reduce incidents escalating to legal courts. On the heels of the extensive civil unrest we've seen over the past several months, Axon established a fourth company mission, a pillar, which I talked about last quarter centering on racial equity, diversity and inclusion. Our teams are greatly inspired by this new mission and joined forces to develop a new company-wide initiative Sprint for Justice led by Jeff Kunins, our CPO. Our entire engineering team came together in one enormously successful and productive two weeks sprint they created and shipped eight new capabilities in support of Axon's new goal. We have prominently highlighted these in a graphic within our Q3 shareholder letter and you can link from the front page of our website. Another big call out this quarter, significant traction in federal where bookings were up 400% compared to last year. We're establishing a strong foothold in the early innings here with big wins across new customers and programs. We've been making strategic investments into the U.S. federal market and we view this early success as a game changer. And with that I'd like to introduce you to the game-changing person who's behind this. And that is Richard Coleman, our Vice President and General Manager of Federal programs. Richard came to us from General Dynamics where he started out as a Solutions Architect for Department of Defense Geosynchronous Satellite Programs, he progressed to capture management where we won multiple $100 million and $1 billion programs. We certainly hope he'll be doing that with us here. And he finally finished his General Dynamics 18-year career as a Vice President and GM for Law Enforcement Systems. Richard? Awesome. Thank you, Richard. It's been just a real pleasure having you on our team and your impact has been remarkable as demonstrated this past quarter. I want to conclude my segment by thanking our employees. Look, we're all going a little stir crazy working from home in this wild turbulent 2020. And I just think about the mental toughness and commitment that people have summoned this year to work through it and deliver the kind of results this team is delivering. It's not lost on me that, we are in a fortunate position despite the fact that we're in the midst of a global pandemic, we've been blessed that we have superior talent across the organization, we have mission-critical products and we're finding new and increasing pathways to growth and a powerful financial model. And with that, I want to turn it over to our President, Luke Larson. Why don't you take that one Richard? Yes. Absolutely. I think we're very, very excited about where we're at right now with interest in live streaming and other connected features with a AB3. Without going too deep into the numbers, I would say, like we feel really good about the amount of adoption we've seen through 10 or 11 months here and certainly going into next year have a very strong pipeline of connected services. Whenever you launch a new product and really at any point in the year customers need some time to build in that ask into their budget. And so while this year a lot of our new cameras that were first time purchases included a lot of the connected services. Going into next year, I think a big point of focus for us in kind of year two of those budget cycles are now to be able to get all those upgraded cameras on those same connected plans. And our customers have been working with us and of course with their city councils and so forth to identify funding to add those feature sets on. And so we're really excited about kind of the runway we have to get hopefully one day every single AB3 onto our Respond or Respond Plus platforms. Ultimately, the majority of TASER 7s are on subscription plans the vast majority. And so essentially, the way I think about it is over time as the mix of T7s keeps going up relative to our other TASERs the more of that number will be driven up as well. So I certainly would expect although nothing is guaranteed that we would look for that number to keep growing unless there's like an outsized international order as a one-time purchase or an outsized order on X2 or X26P is a onetime purchase we certainly would expect that number to keep trending up. Yes. We definitely have goals across all products including dispatch and records. And certainly we've seen a lot of really promising indicators in terms of interest and commitments this year that will translate into deployments and dollars next year in dispatch and records. And then on the TASER business I think as we look at next year we kind of try to set a goal for ourselves of how much we want the TASER business to grow year-over-year. And absolutely, we anticipate TASER growth in that number. But likewise we expect all segments to grow including software and sensors, cloud and so forth. Yes. Go ahead, Richard. Yes sure. So in Q2, obviously with the lockdowns and so forth that was domestically probably the low point of the year in TASER sales. And Q3 we really roared back and I'm so proud of our entire global team, especially in this case our state and local team. And I think there is certainly a record interest in TASERs. We see that quarter-over-quarter here. And we expect that to continue to grow both in state and local where we see it more incrementally. And then federal and international where our hope is we see it more exponentially. And so across the board I think there is very strong demand for TASERs. I think you'll continue to see that throughout the year here and we're very excited at the opportunity to continue to be able to package our deescalation devices with our software and sensors, packages on the body cam, cloud side and on the record side and so forth. Yes. I've got to jump in here and say as well do not forget the TASER business. It is a really transformative and exciting business. Before this decade is out, we will have a weapon that is going to be neck-and-neck or even outperforming a 9-millimeter and stopping power. And I think we've got the opportunity to become the primary weapon of law enforcement officers around the world. And that message has been really positively received by law enforcement.  When I released my book last year, we were nervous as to how that investment would resonate. But I can tell you especially in the environment we're in right now no officer wants to use legal force. And we just -- we've got a really good less lethal weapon system today, but we still have room to improve and I'm really excited about the things that are coming down the road. And just the opportunity even with TASER 7 just got approved in the U.K. I mean we're getting approved in new markets where our existing upgrades are going to be really opening a lot of revenue opportunity. And I don't see that coming out of scheme -- running out of a scheme any time soon. So let me start, and then I'll pass over to Josh, who is here. I would say overall, being virtual the level of attendance I think we had something like 10,000 people sign-up, which is something like 4x or 5x in last year. Now not all of them showed up and the level of engagement probably wasn't as high, because we didn't have their undivided attention. But the feedback we got was people really enjoyed it. We set out VR headsets loaded with some of the content for at least a subset of the attendees. So I think given the challenges, people really responded well. Now we do see the value of in-person in the future. But this year, I think actually in terms of quantity of touch, it was actually broader than it's been before just maybe not as deep in terms of giving their time for three full days. Josh, do you want to add on anything? Yes. I'll take the first part of that question on net retention. That's exactly right. Our strategy has been geared towards selling more higher-value-added bundles like OSP 7 Plus. And as more customers adopt that then we should expect -- we will expect to see our net retention increase. And then for the second part of your question, I'm going to kick it over to Josh. One thing, before we continue, Andrea, I'm going to go ahead and just take one moment and I'm going to share my screen. And I'm demonstrating with you guys a feedback tool I use with a lot of our customer interactions it's called Slido. And it is a way that I can take feedback from groups of customers, while I'm doing these calls. So I want to do the same thing with you. If you get out your smartphone and go to slido.com and enter the code Axon or just point your smartphone camera at the QR code, that will open up Slido for you. And there we're going to get some of your feedback and you can ask some questions there that I can come to at the end. And while we're doing that, Andrea, back to you to keep running with the questions. Did I break it? All right. Do I need to stop my screen share, Doug? Okay. Let me take that one. A few weeks ago, I had gotten an e-mail from a Republican U.S. Congressmen, who would inform me that part of their platform on police reform was to promote body cameras for every officer in America. And that's coming through the Republicans. I think you would also see on the Democratic side of the aisle that we're -- there's a lot of support for police reform particularly around body cameras. But I'll tell you once we really get into the conversation people also very quickly understand the value of TASER weapons. I mean we saw the tragedy in Philadelphia a few weeks ago and the community there has risen up including the family of the deceased really pushing the agency, why didn't every office there have a TASER. Again we obviously don't like to see those sort of tragedies happening or try to leverage them. But we do have solutions that really matter and we think it's bipartisan. And I would tell you I just -- on a personal note, I've been pretty worn out by all the devices missed in the country, but the last 48 hours, I was expecting a lot more of it. And I'm feeling a lot more -- a lot less division right now. I think we may see a more productive coming together as we move into next year after the exhaustion of 2020 and I think on both sides of the aisle. We have a positive solution-oriented technology program that can be part of a police reform bill that police want that communities want and I think legislators can see the value of them. So I'm optimistic. Andrea a couple have come in through the chat real quick. I don't know if you want to just touch on those about the sales of body cams used by correctional guards and police officers. I think we're seeing some major correctional agencies and sheriff's offices are now starting to deploy these. In fact Josh you could talk -- you stood up a team to go after these adjacent markets. And I think we're seeing real reception right? Right. And I think we already answered the other question that was in there. So you guys have already seen. In fact we've already had three people respond which I appreciate. I'm going to leave this up. The call is basically over. But if you get a chance go into Slido and check it out. It's been an invaluable tool. I get a lot of feedback from customers this way. And we're having some fun where if you can guess the majority of our backgrounds whether they're real or not what office it's from, we're going to send you some Swag. So give us your shirt size your email. And thanks and also give us your feedback. We want to know are you enjoying the format sometimes we get a little more informal. I figure you're probably going stir crazy like we are. So we're listening it up trying to make it kind of fun, knowing you've got a lot of work you're going to be working late in tonight. We hope you will look forward to our earnings call, not just for the great results, but because we're going to have all fun together. So thanks. It's good to see the country, I feel coming together. I have this optimism looking into the future. In general, it's been a rough year. And thanks for sticking with us. And again, to every Axon employee, I couldn't be more proud to be part of this team. I just love working with you all and look forward to reporting our next results in the New Year. So, thanks everybody."

            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Absolutely, Jeremy. I think we've seen over the last 10 years certainly body cameras were a little slower out of the gate to be adopted. But now we've put ourselves in a market leadership position there. And certainly part of our strategy as we've talked about is around OSP 7 plus and packaging our record solutions with our body camera solutions. I'd say this about the competition like we have a lot of respect for all the different companies in the market. They're all great companies and well run and so forth.  But at the same time like we've built our team and our channel and our product team and our company for moments like this where we can enter new markets and we can win in them. And so this year, we've seen very promising results and I certainly believe in our team and I think we're going to end up in a spot where we are the market leaders not only in records, but also in dispatch and every day we're waking up getting one step closer to that. Just to the questions about social unrest. Look like I want to be really conscious of how we talk about this. It's not a victory when there's the type of social unrest that there is today. And so, certainly like our team, I think we think about our sales process the exact same way every day, like we are going to cover the market well. We're going to talk about the value that our products provide across the board and we really, really believe in that value. And sometimes it takes an external factor for a customer to maybe be more motivated to buy it or whatever the case may be. But we really believe like hey we're just going to keep focusing on the things we can control, and we believe we're going to end up in a really positive place not only as a business but in terms of fulfilling our goals and missions in society. I think we're going to feel really good about that. And I want to kick it over to Luke, maybe just to talk a little more about Accelerate as well. I think he had something to say as well. Thanks. Okay. So, on the net revenue retention, I also just want to give a big shout out to our customer success or this is an order we invested and substantially this year to build this out and make sure our customers continue to have a great experience. And Lisa Krolikowski and her team have just done an awesome job ensuring that. And I think that's reflected in net revenue retention. Do you mind just reminding me of the second part of that question? Yes. So I think for us, like, with OSP right now, I think, we're seeing a lot of midsize and larger agencies start to show a lot of interest in it. And I think that's where we're having the most success. As we kind of took a holistic look at our pricing and packaging strategy going into next year, I think, you'll start to see us test OSP like offerings that are a little more tailored to specific segments. So in corrections, I think, we're very excited to offer an OSP package there that's more tailored to corrections. I think with inside sales that handle our smaller customers, we're going to be experimenting there as well with the same type of package that's a little more tailored for smaller agencies. So our goal is to have every customer buy a camera, a software license, a records license and a TASER at the same time. And I think we're on our way to that. And hopefully, with some of the adjustments and tailoring types of initiatives that we're undertaking right now, I think, we'll continue to see more and more positive signs there. Yes. Absolutely Rick. I think this is a place where historically there hasn't necessarily been a lot of focus on it in terms of like individuals that that's really all they do day in and day out. And over the last two years we've built that team and I think it's already presenting pretty incredible returns. And I think once these representatives go out and talk to customers I think they're really parlaying the success to the similar use cases around the country within corrections. And we expect that to continue I think between corrections and some of our other adjacent markets of private security and eventually fire and EMS and so forth. We'll continue to see more and more momentum both on the TASER side and on the body cam side."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Jeff Kunins",
            "content": "Ultimately, I think, we view any international customer as an opportunity to not only sell TASERs and body cams, but also move them to the cloud and Evidence.com. And for some markets right off the bat customers are adopting Evidence.com. For other markets they're adopting our on-premise solution named Commander first and then subsequently moving to Evidence.com over time. I think for us the most important thing for any international customer is to get one of our products in their hands. And it really doesn't necessarily matter to us which one they start with because we can really feel confident betting on ourselves that we'll be able to deploy more and more of our products with those same customers over time. No. Thank you."
        },
        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Luke Larson",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. There are so many great things to talk about from Axon Accelerate our user conference to our massive early success in the U.S. federal market that Richard talked about to the strength of the demand for our software services and our Officer Safety Plan subscription and the phenomenal adoption we're seeing. We detailed a lot of it in our shareholder letter. So to avoid being too repetitive, I just want to highlight just two of the many successes from this quarter. First, TASER. We're not just selling TASER devices anymore. The category is evolving from a book and ship hardware product to a subscription-based deescalation platform that includes cloud software and training. And we see this in the percentage of TASER devices sold on a subscription, which rose to a record 75% this quarter. This 75% reflects a surge in demand for TASER in the U.S. Internationally, we are still getting started. And so while subscription levels are lower than in the U.S., we are confident, we can also drive subscriptions abroad. Second, we launched Axon Respond, which is a giant leap in police communications technology. We are evolving real-time situational awareness beyond the radio. Going back two years, we spent more than 1000 hours studying what was wrong with 911 operations. So we could deliver a compelling solution to fix it. Rather than describe it, we're going to play the video that we showed at Axon Accelerate. Most of the technology you'll see in this video is in the market today with a few exceptions including fleet three with license plate reading which we are aiming to bring to market mid-next year. Doug can you play the video?  [Video Presentation] Awesome. And one last shout out for me to all of our employees that helped deliver these record results. And with that I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer Jawad. And just one quick addition to that, as we talked about in the shareholder letter both from a sales perspective, but also just usage and engagement while it's still early days over 200 agencies have used Aware actively in the last 30 days with more than two dozen consistently using it every single week now. And we've seen just tremendous growth in the adoption of live streaming as it begins to roll out. We've seen it grow over 6x over the past six months. Yes. Accelerate was a huge success in terms of being able to connect with the customers digitally which I think a year ago it would have been very tough to get the key decision-makers from major cities to invest in time via Zoom call or another format. And so that's been one of the silver linings of the pandemic is us being able to rapidly push people to these virtual-type engagements. And so we walked away being very, very pleased to Rick's point of being able to hit a larger number of customers, and showcasing all of the tools around deescalation transparency. And then, just finally to Josh's point on the social rest -- social unrest, we really are trying to solve and be part of the solution in these really difficult complex situations. And so our customers aren't looking to us as somebody that's coming to them out of the blue. We've invested in decades of relationships where they know the tools that we're creating are going to help them resolve these really difficult issues in the best possible outcome. Yes. I would just add -- I would echo Rick's comments. I think this is really -- we're seeing now bipartisan support for reform that would include technologies for products like body cameras, as well as increased training. In June, Joe Biden called for $300 million to reinvigorate community policing. And so regardless of the outcome I think this is an area where kind of the pragmatic voice is going to win in terms of saying we actually need more training to reform police more funds going in there than to actually cut funds from there."
        },
        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Jawad Ahsan",
            "content": "Thanks Luke. I'm also very proud of our employees for putting up another quarter of solid execution which drove outperformance across most of our metrics. Earlier this year, we shared our plans to invest in our channel product and support infrastructure as we look to scale the business to $1 billion in revenue and beyond. These investments yielded results ahead of our expectations as evidenced by our strength in outlook for 2020. We intend to continue these types of investments in 2021. Two areas in particular highlight how we think about calibrating our investments for growth in a dual track near and long strategy. With certain channel investments such as federal and international, we can start to unlock revenue relatively quickly in the near term.  Meanwhile with other investments particularly in our software product categories such as records and dispatch we're bringing new products to market that will disrupt legacy incumbent providers over the long term. This combination of right-sized investments ensures growth over the near and long term and with growing diversification the particular product or channel that drives this growth will look different from quarter to quarter. Now let's turn to our outlook. For 2020, we believe we can deliver full year revenue of $630 million to $640 million. The out-performance versus our original 2020 revenue midpoint expectation of $620 million reflects strength across the business as well as growing customer diversification particularly in federal and international. As you see in our shareholder letter we're also tracking above plan on the bottom line and that's driven by revenue out-performance expense leverage in travel and event cost savings of about $12 million. In 2021, we expect to continue to build on our strong momentum. Given the rapid pace of growth we're seeing, we want to provide you with a framework around our view of the business. Since our August update, we've seen an uptick in our level of visibility. While there is some risk from the ongoing impacts of COVID most municipal budgets for January have been set. And after taking into account some small pockets of budget slowdown, we feel confident in our positioning and outlook heading into next year. In addition, we're continuing to diversify in products and markets. Our initial view of the business for next year is for $720 million to $750 million in revenue with $120 million to $130 million in adjusted EBITDA. This reflects continued strength on the top line and consistent adjusted EBITDA margin performance excluding the aforementioned $12 million of expense favorability in 2020 due to the pandemic. Finally I want to touch on ESG which we're hearing about from a growing number of our investors. Axon is a mission-driven company whose overarching goal is to protect life and that social mission is what drew many of us to the company. We see fully 100% of our revenues as supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In our shareholder letter we talk about Sprint for Justice which Rick mentioned earlier. This product development initiative created features such as automatically flagging body camera video, if a racial slur is detected using VR training to help officers better respond to high-stake situations and promoting a growth mindset among officers by offering a coaching feature. ESG is a growing area of focus for us and you can expect to see more from us on this front over the coming year. We're in the final stretch of a high-performance year. I want to reiterate, how proud I am of our employees for their crisp execution in a challenging environment and for their unwavering support of our customers. As we plan for 2021 we feel highly confident about how we're positioned across the board. And with that, Andrea let's move to questions. Yes, absolutely. So we made investments this year in new geographies that we had never been in before. And it was really on the heels of investments we made in the previous years in new markets like India and the Ukraine. We have seen very early -- like great results early on. I'm going to let Josh talk a little bit more about that. When we put boots on the ground, there's no substitute for that. And what we found is that by having folks there by establishing offices having employees, Axon employees in these new markets it leads to not only increase pipeline, but in many cases a return within the same year. And so we're doubling down on that strategy, the channel investments next year we're going to expand even more geographies. From a product standpoint we're continuing to invest very heavily in software. The Sprint for Justice initiative that Jeff led with his team this year is a great example of just the type of leverage that we could expect to see from the investments we've already made in our product and just a little bit of extra effort goes a long way. And then from the support infrastructure standpoint, we are in the process of getting ready to be $1 billion-plus revenue company and everything that comes along with it from an ERP implementation, which we're well underway in HRIS and other back-office support systems that we're putting in place to help the company scale. Yes. Of course, look, one of our core values as a company is transparency. We've got great relationships with our investors and our analysts and we've always prided ourselves on the level of information, and detail that we share in helping them model our business. One of the things that, we heard pretty consistently throughout 2020 was that after we pulled our guidance earlier this year it was a little difficult to model our business. We've got a lot of moving parts and increasing amount of complexity in the business. And as you point out, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world. But the reality is that our business has been diversifying along two vectors. Who we sell to is rapidly expanding beyond law enforcement and where we sell is rapidly expanding beyond the U.S. So the fact is that our business is more resilient today than it's ever been. And so we wanted to share our view on how 2021 is lining up for us again in an effort to help folks model our business. Not at this time, Joe. We gave directional guidance for how we're thinking about 2021 and we feel good about that guidance today but that's the extent of the detail we're going to get into. Yes. It's a great way to say it Jeremy. I am more excited about our TASER business now than I ever have been in my time at Axon. Actually I've never felt better about the company overall. And obviously TASER is a big part of that. And we talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks about this like near and long strategy where in the near-term we can still see growth from TASER both domestically there's still life space. We talked about all the reasons why over the last couple of years. But now with federal and with international that's going to be an important growth vector for TASER.  And then with these investments we're making in product with records and dispatch, we think that that's going to be at -- those are SaaS businesses our ARR is now top $200 million. So we're not necessarily small anymore, but that's still ramping very quickly. And as that revenue comes online over the next few years that's going to help two, three, four years out. Keeping our growth rate growing at an accelerated pace. I actually I wanted to jump back in as well one thing you haven't heard us talk a lot about I'm just as excited as Rick is talking about TASER. One area, we haven't talked a lot about in the past, but I think you're going to start hearing more from us Jeremy is the consumer business. So I'm just so part of our consumer team. We had a plan for the year -- for the full year in revenue and they hit that plan in the first seven months of the year. They're having a banner year. We're expecting big things from that business. We've got a couple of product launches in the horizon in the next year or two. So, that's another area that we're expecting to see some growth. Yes. Great question, Charlie. It's a little bit of both. Earlier in the year we saw increased sales from the -- as a side effect of folks staying home and wanting more self-defense options. As you know, like, gun sales were up and TASER sales were up for similar reasons, as folks looked for self-defense options for home. We hired a new general manager for the consumer business. He started earlier this year. He's got a fantastic marketing background and he's been completely up-leveling our game. As you pointed out, it's the same products, but we're really stepping up our game from a marketing standpoint and we've been making a run-in, not only increasing sales with distributors, but especially with direct-to-consumer. And those results have yielded some pretty great returns early on. Next year, as I mentioned, we're looking at a couple of product launches that I think are going to get even more of a push. And we're focusing not only on the TASER form factor, but there are some other form factors that we think are very appealing to folks that don't necessarily want to fire a weapon, per se, but more of a TASER that's got a different form factor like we've had in the past that we've discontinued. So those types of things we think are going to be opening up new markets for us. And then, from a margin standpoint, they're actually going to be very helpful. The consumer business is at -- we haven't actually disclosed this publicly, but it's a very attractive margin. It's accretive to our law enforcement margins and that's true with the cartridges as well."

Please go ahead Rick.\nRick Smith: Thank you, Andr\u00e9a. And thank you everyone for joining us today. During our last quarterly update in May, one of the biggest issues we addressed was how we were managing our business through a pandemic. One quarter later we have so much more to talk about because we've all watched thousands of people take to the streets demanding police and public safety reform. Our company's reason to exist, our mission is for exactly moments like right now, protect life. We are on a mission to make energy weapons so safe and so effective that we make bullets obsolete. We preserve truth; body cameras protect officers to bad claims and citizens from bad behavior. Increasing transparency and reducing social conflict. We accelerate justice with advanced cloud software and AI that have potential to make the entire justice system more fair and more effective. When you think of gun violence, social conflict and a fair justice system, most people don't think of these as technology problems but it's political problems. We frame them as problems where technology can play a transformative role. Now look technology is no panacea and it cannot solve these problems for us. However, almost any problem can be solved faster and more effectively with the right technology tools to help people solve them. So as we look at all the pain and anger today, we ask ourselves what we can do to help promote equity. Our superpower is creating technology to address social problems that many others see as intractable. So we've added a fourth mission to inspire our work; centering racial equity inclusion and diversity, which might make you, wonder how you can build technology to promote equity. If you want to hear specific examples of how we are using technology to support this new mission, you'll have to wait and come join us at our conference Accelerate later this month. We made Axon can't change the policies and cultural norms in policing, but we can build the tech tools to help our customers do it. We're hearing consistent and emphatic calls for change from the most prominent leaders of law enforcement and we are excited to build the tools to help them. Back when we began investing in body cameras in 2008, we faced innumerable skeptics we faced numerous skeptics. But, we knew that body cameras were the future. And body cameras started gaining traction after a wave of protests began in Ferguson Missouri in 2014, which was really the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement. At the time, we were delivering the right capabilities at the right time and our investments in cloud software made body cameras suddenly feasible and affordable for all agencies. We invested in body cameras when nobody believed they were possible and as the investment community well knows our core body camera and software business lost money from 2008 to 2019 when it began to turn a profit. Those 11 years of continuous investment in R&D to prove out the feasibility and sustainability of body cameras are now the foundation for our next leg of growth. In 2020, we're humbled to be developing solutions that once again find themselves relevant to a national conversation about policing. We do not shy away from these hard discussions and we see the pain and the nuance behind demands to defund police. This is really all about reforming and reshaping the justice system. And these are issues that we engage with daily. They're not new to us. We invite input from a broad spectrum of voices; we have the industry's most relevant and productive ethics board with renewed calls for reform we can leverage technology and policy changes to improve public safety. We believe that our product moment fit is why our pipeline continues to strengthen as communities see the power of our platform to drive positive change. And now with that I'm going to turn over to our President, Luke Larson.\nLuke Larson: Thanks Rick. In a few weeks on August 25th as Rick mentioned, we'll be hosting our Annual Technology Summit Axon Accelerate. Due to COVID, we've shifted this to a virtual event which has allowed us to grow the event to reach a much bigger scale of our audience and customers. We're also able to offer a cutting edge virtual reality track. If you'd like to attend go to axon.com and register. We're very excited to share some key customer updates and product announcements on how Axon can help officers and the communities they serve ensure everyone makes it home safe. Our strategic priorities in 2020 are to continue to execute in our core market, while accelerating our path to market in new product categories. Our engineering and product teams are solving some of the most difficult problems at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds to advance our mission. This is also a year where we have walked beside our customers in one of the most challenging environments they have ever faced. Our customer facing teams have built amazing relationships with our customers not by selling devices or software but by becoming trusted advisors on how we can help customers with the important problems they are facing. We are helping them to source mission critical technology amid greater public budget scrutiny; helping them to access federal dollars where available and we aspire to be true partners to our customers. We are emphasizing the mission critical importance of our OSP 7 plus offering de-escalation, transparency and productivity have never been more critical to police and community relations during this watershed moment. And our offerings address these exact situations. This emphasis drove our Q2 results with revenue up 26% year-over-year. This is a strong performance in the context of one of the toughest macros we've faced, a global pandemic and massive economic uncertainty. Our strong results were also driven by a stellar quarter for international up 80% year-over-year to $34 million. This was on top of 38% international revenue growth in Q1. We were just getting started in large markets such as Brazil and India and three countries top $1 million in revenue for the first time in the quarter. Indonesia, Panama and Thailand. Turning to the bottom line GAAP income was affected by stock-based compensation and tax expense; adjusted EBITDA was $28 million reflecting a 20% margin which showcases our cost discipline and some travel savings related to COVID. Turning to operations; you will see the inventory build on our balance sheet. This was very intentional. We have adopted well -- we have adapted well to an ongoing supply chain environment that we've never seen. Recall that last year we diversified our supply chain and global manufacturing footprint due to tariffs and it turns out that those initiatives positioned us well to handle COVID-19; even so given the number of unforeseen challenges that could lay ahead and the fact that 2020 is full of curveballs, we've elevated our inventory build in the first half. This safety stock helps minimize shipping disruptions and also prepares us for some key Axon Body 3 shipments to major customers in Q3 and Taser orders we are expected to fulfill in the back half of the year. Currently, we expect Q3 inventory levels to remain about the same and by the end of the year they could come down by as much as 10%. And with that I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jawad.\nJawad Ahsan: Thanks Luke. Our second quarter performance was a testament to our ability to deliver sharp execution in a challenging environment. Although demand remained robust, domestic customers were often banned with constraint. Dealing with COVID-19, personnel outages, employee safety concerns and caution about uncertain budgets. Even with these challenges, Q3 revenue is generally in line with our pre-pandemic expectations. Domestic body camera bookings remain strong and our international expansion continues to accelerate. Our results in the quarter speak to our resilience as a company and the critical importance of our products and our customers lives. A few years ago, we set out on a journey to transform into an enterprise software company that also sells devices. And our performance this past quarter further solidifies that path. High margin annual recurring revenue grew 42% to $183 million; software revenue was a record 30% of total sales and we sustained SaaS net revenue retention of 119% Turning to our outlook; we're watching to see whether states shut down in the fall, which could bring renewed caution on budgeting. There is just enough outside of our control regarding COVID-19 that we did not reinstate formal full-year guidance. We did provide a range that we are managing toward for Q3. There are two factors to keep in mind when considering our interim Q3 guidance. The first is that we made a strategic and intentional decision to prioritize growing our Cloud user base and adding nodes to our network in the early days of our Software and Sensors business. As a result, we have contracts with strategically important agencies both domestically and internationally that have served as beachhead accounts but come with a lower margin than average. The second factor is that the majority of our multi-year contracts come with hardware refreshes at periodic intervals, which come at a lower margin than the SaaS portion of these contracts. The confluence of these two factors will conspire in Q3 to be a headwind on our gross margins, which we expect will normalize by Q4, anticipating a question we often receive these days we are not seeing changes in buying activity due to police defunding concerns. In fact, we've seen some anecdotal acceleration of body camera buying decisions due to agencies wishing to provide transparency to the communities. We remain confident in our long-term, multi-year outlook. We're privileged to be working on solutions to some of society's most entrenched challenges. We're just getting started in several new markets internationally and in several new software product lines. Importantly, the addition of capital from our recent follow-up offering further strengthened our balance sheet and provides us with even greater flexibility to continue investing for growth. At quarter end, we had $675 million of cash and investments and zero debt. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to share some insight with you as to how we view the company relative to the investments we're making and where we're headed. The first phase of the company's growth let's call it Axon 1.0 saw us establishing the Taser business and building an unparalleled sales channel with law enforcement. The second phase of our growth Axon 2.0 saw us continuing to innovate with the introduction of smart devices including body-worn and in-car cameras, which integrated seamlessly with our customer focus cloud network. Now we're entering the next phase of our growth Axon 3.0. We're building a rapidly evolving public safety ecosystem with both connected devices and intuitive workflows powered by AI with the increasingly powerful Axon Cloud as our centerpiece. Our mission with this ecosystem is to protect life, capture truth and accelerate justice. Now more than ever society is driving towards these outcomes and Axon is uniquely positioned to partner with our customers and deliver on all three. And with that Andr\u00e9a, let's move to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead James. \nJamesFaucette: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask the team Rick, Luke obviously there's a lot of pressure on police departments at the very least to improve efficiencies et cetera. Where are we now in terms of some of the software products like records, dispatch et cetera to really effectively reduce time that officers have to spend on paperwork et cetera and so they can spend more time in the field and gain efficiencies that way and how well are you being able to communicate the current capabilities to the customers.\nRickSmith: Well, I would say the best answer to that question will be if you tune in to Accelerate; we have some pretty significant new announcements, and we'll be showcasing some new capabilities that will have a big impact on efficiency. One of which we've been in field trials that'll go -- it's going into full release and I can tell you that one agency in Canada was testing one of those capabilities that was absolutely transformative; they had two homicides happening in a short period of time and for a small agency these great tremendous levels of workload and one of our new AI products actually helped them handle two simultaneously. That they said without us they would have been at risk actually potentially having those cases at risk of getting disqualified because they would not have been able to process all the paperwork and evidence data and meet the judicial deadlines. So stay tuned and Accelerate for more but both records and dispatch are live in the field and we're now beginning to start really linking some of the AI capabilities to power the creation of the structured data in those systems from the unstructured data we capture with our body cameras.\nJamesFaucette: Got it. And then as a follow-up you mentioned Canada but it was interesting at least to us to see the big jump in international revenue. Where are you and how much should we think you'd be thinking about the ability that you have in other international markets to take the success of Taser and take it over to body cameras and some of the other software products in those markets?\nRickSmith: Josh, why don't you start answering that as a head of sales?\nJosh Isner: Yes. Thanks very much James for the question. Ultimately, I think we see a lot of similarities regarding where international is now versus where domestic was four or five years ago, and we're very much following the same playbook. We're going to be focused on fewer markets than the entire world and we're going to continue to build out a few markets at a time over the next few years. I think the investments we made in our Tier 1 markets a couple years ago building really talented teams there, focusing on expanding both Taser and getting our early body camera and deems customers there are why you're starting to receive the revenue results now and as we continue to build bookings up internationally, we expect revenue to follow in future years. So our focus is to build very, very talented teams in the markets that we see as potential movers; and we'll start to introduce some of our newer products into those markets that are already showing great results. And as more and more markets kind of come up to speed, we'll introduce our newer and newer products as those markets become larger markets and deployments of body cams and Tasers.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from Keith Housum at Northcoast Research. Go ahead Keith.\nKeith Housum: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Rick, in terms of the budget relief which the government is considering is there any impact to your guidance if budget relief is offered to the state local agencies over the next several months?\nRickSmith: Yes. I think it'd just be pretty speculative for us to speculate on what might go in there, obviously, if there's a lot of money specifically earmarked to state and local agencies; we suspect in this environment that it would end up being focused towards a lot of the transparency tools things we're doing with body cameras et cetera. We've also seen a lot of interest in corrections growing around the Taser weapons because COVID-19 still remains a big issue and particularly in confined environments. So there's more focus on maintaining safe distances, traditionally in corrections if you have an inmate that decides that they're going to become resistant to following the procedures they have to that is meant correctional officers suiting up and having to go hands-on in a very close personal; you're covered in each other's sweat and other things you really worry about. So our plan does not account for any additional federal funding, if it comes in I think there could be a little bit of upside, but I wouldn't -- again I don't respectfully too much.\nKeith Housum: Fair enough. Right, Jawad just a little bit housekeeping here in terms of the EBITDA margins for the next quarter what's the impact of your large contracts on your EBITDA margins?\nJawadAhsan: Yes. That was part of what we signaled with our Q3 guidance, Keith. we have some large international customers; we have a couple of international, sorry domestic customers that have we consider to be strategic beachhead accounts where the margins are lower on the camera contracts, and as those customers get the refreshes on their contracts in the quarters that we ship which Q3 happens to be one we're going to see lower margins, which is why we gave that specific guidance for Q3.\nKeith Housum: Right but would it be fair to say the impact of those shipments could be 2% on the EBITDA margins, is that fair assumption?\nJawadAhsan: Well, it's -- we are anticipating the EBITDA margins to be 12% on our Q3 revenues. We don't have formal guidance for the year. So I can't officially say what that impact is going to be.\nAndreaJames: Yes. Keith and if you dive into the segment commentary in the shareholder letter we're even more specific on the gross margin thoughts by segment. We'll take our next question from Joe Osha at JMP Securities. Go ahead Joe.\nJoeOsha: Hi, thank you for taking my question. One of the questions that have come up around this notion of police funding is the idea that some functions might be taken over by non-sworn officers. I'm wondering about how Axon sees the opportunity to address those types of people. Thank you.\nRickSmith: Yes. Let me take that one. So first of all I had a really interesting call with a major city Police Chief where we were talking about the defunding phenomenon and what happened and what he related to me was actually they did reassign portions of his budget to other portions of the city, so basically they just shifted some resources out of police to other city agencies. And then his net budget was actually increased fairly significantly for body cameras and transparency tools; so in that respect he was pleasantly surprised that the whole defunding discussion actually led for their agency to a better place; allowed them to focus in on their function a bit more reliance and partner agencies within the city to take a little more of the load and ultimately give them a little more budget for tech. Now ultimately, we'll see how this plays out in other agencies but we believe that this idea that right now law enforcement, they're doing a lot of social services. They're dealing with homeless people and mental health issues because you pick up the phone and you dial 911 for a lot of things that maybe don't need a cop. And so as we think about our dispatch software what a great time to be introducing a new cloud-based dispatch capability, where we can obviously shift our roadmap and be looking at introducing new features things that would allow agencies to perhaps integrate better with other city agencies that might not traditionally be dispatched oriented tight folks to use some of our communication tools in ways that would allow the dispatchers to dispatch non-sworn officers to different types of events. So we tend to love change as an organization and times are changing rapidly here and we view that our DNA sets us up well to move quickly to new opportunities.\nLukeLarson: That's right and Joe I think how we talked about when we last spoke about when you think about something like dispatch and you think about something like Axon Aware and building geo relocation and live streaming into our cameras really being part of a bigger mission for agencies around real-time operations and broadening that lens. This is exactly the perfect scenario for which that is purpose-built. And so even right out of the box the integration of acts on dispatch and Axon Aware bringing together the ability to bring other kinds of resources into an incident in real time is a capability that is just native to our Cloud-borne approach to all of these categories.\nJoeOsha: Thank you and just following on that, if I may. Is it possible perhaps that we might see an opportunity to deploy Axon Body alongside some of this new dispatch technology with non-sworn community officers or whatever we're going to call them?\nRickSmith: Absolutely. We're seeing also not only the ability for non-sworn officers to be able to use cameras but for sworn officers to be able to live stream with folks like mental health experts that can be helping them in real time dealing with complex situations, where those officers might need more expertise. But we actually think this could open up some education areas particularly if you have unarmed non-sworn people; your ability to identify emerging dangers becomes even more important because you have to rapidly route armed officers to the scene to help out.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Berg at Needham. Go ahead Scott.\nScottBerg: Hi, everyone. Congrats on the great quarter. Thanks for taking a couple questions here. I guess first I don't know if this is a question for Luke or for Rick but Rick in your newsletter you talk about OSP pipelines in particular strong including the components for RMS. Now you just signed a really large contract with Baltimore that includes records but I guess what are you seeing on the records but I guess what are you seeing on the records level out there maybe from a demand perspective that would suggest those OSP 7 contracts with records will actually be implemented and utilized because that seems early given the commentary, but obviously great if that's the case.\nRickSmith: Sure. I'll take that and -- to Josh. --Or different -- [Multiple Speakers]\nJosh Isner: I'll go ahead and take that. So I love that question and so again like we talked about last quarter, we're thrilled that well more than a dozen agencies are already live signed or being actively deployed on records using one or more modules of product. And we're incredibly confident of the trajectory as you've seen with the Baltimore announcement both committed adoptions among OSP customers, as well as continuing interest for the pipeline beyond that, continue to accelerate well ahead of even our expectations. And I think the two key things at play there like we talked about before the first is the power of the bundle makes it an easy choice for them to take advantage of that benefit at a perceived value point that goes hand in hand with what they're already paying for because it's effectively -- it's already included with the money they've already committed to. And then second is this key notion that we've talked about of Axon standards which is this use of force reporting module. And what's beautiful about standards is that it just so happens in records that every agency has to use of force reporting but they typically use a third party module for it. They don't actually use their historical RMS, but because standards is built right into Axon records it's the perfect first experience that they can use it as and rather than and or with their legacy RMS to begin getting value out of it right away with incredible easy deployment and then from there decide when they're ready to migrate their entire RMS; and that's exactly what happened with Cincinnati and we're seeing that same pattern play out as we go forward because it's incredibly easy to deploy; it works side by side with what they've already got and then as they come to love it whenever they're ready they can quickly decide to adopt full records for their entire RMS needs.\nLukeLarson: Yes and specifically on the pipeline; I would say we are seeing more and more agencies interested in OSP 7 plus and we're seeing some acceleration from the agencies that bought OSP-7 plus last year in adopting our standards module of records, as well as a lot of the other key modules like reporting and so forth. So I'm very confident in our team to be able to convert some of those OSP 7 plus opportunities into RMS deployments. We're very focused on and we're very focused on making sure that customers are valuing and adopting all of the benefits in OSP 7 plus, and this is a place where I think certainly the combination of having a very, very strong product organization with a very, very strong channel should lead to outsized results down the road.\nScottBerg: Super helpful. Thanks guys. Then I guess just as a quick follow-up by Jawad, the company's posted four straight quarters of greater than 25% revenue growth which is a nice acceleration from the 12-month period before that. You guys calls for 15% revenue growth in the third quarter, is that just some being conservative in the current lights and micro environment or you see anything else that's maybe tempering that guidance just a little bit? Thank you.\nJawadAhsan: Yes. I'll tack team this Josh with you if that's all right, but we have a plan and operating plan for the year that informed our guidance. And that still pretty much informs what we're managing to. We outperformed in Q1 and Q2, we were very happy with the performance of our business and our sales team. The investments we've been making in international has been really paying off; some of these new markets, new products but we don't obviously bank on that and so we feel that it's prudent to stick relatively close to what our operating plan is which inform the 15% guidance.\nJosh Isner: Yes. Ultimately there are going to be some quarters that have higher revenue growth rates than others. And we feel good about full year. We feel good about kind of our long-term trajectory, but we do view this year as being back half weighted compared to the front half. And it just might be an issue between what comes in at Q3 and what comes in at Q4 of our kind of large CW deal pipeline.\nAndreaJames: Thanks team and also in the back half just on a comparables the percentages are lower but the dominant dollar is much higher is what Josh means on that. Thanks Scott for your questions. Okay, we'll turn to Charlie Anderson at Dougherty. Go ahead Charlie.\nCharlieAnderson: Thanks. So I wanted to ask about bookings; it was very interesting to see the bookings transit very much reflects what we're seeing in the business in terms of international strong domestic not as strong. I wonder is that just a snapshot in time or is that the way we should think about the trajectory of the business in terms of international continuing to put up the big performance and domestic maybe trailing the performance on a year-over-year basis. And then secondly, you made a comment in bookings about the first few weeks of the quarter better than April. I wonder if you could just layer in some context in terms of what that means from your standpoint and what's going on there? And I got follow-up.\nLukeLarson: Yes. Thanks Charlie. We've got a lot of domestic sales people and leaders on the call here that hopefully are motivated by that question and we certainly expect a great back half from our domestic and international teams. I think there was, if you look back at it we lost about half the Q2 due to the pandemic shutdown; everyone was trying to figure out how to conduct like city council meetings and really conduct business on Zoom for the first time. And that certainly slowed down some of our momentum in the first half of Q2 and then really in June, we lost about two weeks due to the kind of civil unrest and the events that followed the killing of George Floyd. So I would look at Q2 more as just kind of a unique point in time due to some external factors that slowed us down a little domestically, but we have high expectations of our team and they're very motivated to turn that trend around in Q3 both domestically and internationally.\nCharlieAnderson: Okay. Great. Another question about the fleet product, there were some points in the shareholder letter about the importance of that product in the back half. So I wonder we can see what the run rate has been the past few quarters of the existing product. I'm curious if you can maybe help us with expectations for how much of a contributor that is. Does it lift to a meaningfully higher level than we've seen historically? Just any context around that launch would be helpful. Thanks.\nJawadAhsan: So I think from a booking's perspective, we do expect fleet three to be a contributor in the back half of the year. I think there's still some question about shipping fleet three and shipments depending on how well the TNES [Indiscernible] 0:33:00.4 go might end up in the front half of 2021 as opposed to the back half of 2020. We don't expect that to have much of an impact on revenue and bookings like I said given the fact that we'll be doing TNES contribute to bookings that we feel great about Fleet 2 has really stabilized in the last couple quarters in terms of customer satisfaction and so forth. And we're excited to build on that momentum as we launch Fleet 3, certainly the ALPR and modular capabilities of Fleet 3 where we can do 360 degree recording around the car and so forth are things our customers are excited about. And we absolutely are confident that we're going to get a great customer reaction from this product and be followed by bookings and revenue associated with it.\nLukeLarson: And just add one clarifying comment there. So we're going to be in some pretty in-depth trials in the back after this year but we don't expect to be in full production ramp of Fleet 3 until 2021 and that's where we'll see the real growth contribution.\nJawadAhsan: And the key Josh mentioned this in addition to it being our best ever in-vehicle camera system straight up as camera system it will also be the launch, as we've said before of our approach, our pretty disruptive and novel approach to the automatic license plate recognition category and mobile where fundamentally it's different than the way it's done today in the market by being disruptively more affordable and better more cost effective for better performance and results by making it a thing that departments can put in every single police vehicle as opposed to a small number of very expensive purpose-built cameras. And of course no matter how good any one camera is it can only be in one place. And then you combine that with it being built from the ground up with ethics and privacy in mind. And our strategic partnership with flock safety for a similar approach for fixed ALPR cameras. We really think it's a watershed change in the way ALPR as a category will work.\nAndreaJames: We'll move to Mark Strauss from JP Morgan. Go ahead Mark.\nMarkStrauss: Hey. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions, pretty impressive international growth the last couple quarters just kind of curious are you -- what trends you're seeing as far as those customers signing up for recurring payment plans. Are these really just kinds of one-off purchases?\nJosh Isner: Hey, Mark. Great to see you again and thanks for the questions. So ultimately, I think it's a combination of a few things. Certainly as we open up new international markets, those first time orders are probably not going to be on recurring payment plans. That's due to our -- we want to make sure we have the ability to collect on all these plans and when we enter markets for the first time, we'd like to see some payment history there first. So that those will be kind of one-time contributors to revenue and we expect those to continue from newer markets, as well as markets making their second and third buys in their Taser programs. The teams have done an awesome job especially in the UK, in Canada driving most of our new deals towards subscriptions. In the UK, I believe almost every or every department is already on a Taser payment plan as opposed to one-time purchases. I think we'll see more of that in Australia over the next 12-months as T-7 starts to get legs there and same in Canada. And so I think in our more established international markets, we'll definitely see more recurring payments on CWS and video alike. And in our newer kind of first and second time buyer type markets those will be driven by more one-time revenue transactions there as we ship those new weapons,\nMarkStrauss: Okay. Thanks Josh and then Rick, this is the highest cash balance that you've had in a long time maybe ever. Can you just talk about your plans for that cash? I mean obviously there are a lot of organic investments that you've been talking about for last several quarters, but how should we think about M&A? How important is that going to be going forward now with this cash -- true that you have?\nRickSmith: Yes. I got it. I can't help but smile. I remember the days we were struggling to pay the light bill and putting stuff on credit cards. And now we've got almost $700 million in cash. I would also say that historically as I'm a skeptic on M&A that I think I'm a Chicago school guy, markets are pretty efficient, M&A a lot of times it always drives up the price of the acquired frequently to the detriment of the acquirer and we still approach M&A from that position that it has to be unquestionably more valuable as a part of our ecosystem than as a standalone in order for an acquisition to make sense for all the headaches that come with integrating different companies. That being said, I think we are in a unique position where we have built and we now have this fairly ubiquitous cloud software and connected hardware ecosystem that make things like partnerships flock safety become pretty powerful, as well as we are really building out our M&A function; it's actually under Andr\u00e9a James who's doing a fantastic job. We've been building out a team but either we get a ton of inbound inquiries and the vast majority of the time we say no because we are on a mission. We've got a lot of focus but we are starting to see -- there are things that will be interesting partnerships and there are some things that could be interesting acquisitions. And we have plenty of cash to have the flexibility to do it when it makes sense, but just want to reassure you we start from the position of no and that we have to overcome some pretty skeptical hurdles before we're going to spend the money, you our shareholders gave us; we're going to treat it very carefully. As if it's the same money I was using to pay those late bills 25 years ago.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeremy Hamblin with Craig Hallum. Thanks Jeremy. Go ahead.\nJeremyHamblin: Thanks Andr\u00e9a. So my question is actually a follow-up really on that cash balance and what you potentially could do with it. You've built some inventory here; you have some clients that may be strapped a little bit in the near term on cash flow. Do you use some of that cash to potentially do kind of Taser 60 type financing here where we look to bridge the gap in the near term while there may be some budget crunch and that's one of the uses of cash?\nRickSmith: Yes. I'll start with this one. So one of the things I love about our cash balance in our position our balance sheet is the optionality it provides us and Jeremy you've honed in on a couple of things that we've been able to do with that optionality. One is of course the inventory build; it was a material amount of cash in the quarter. We felt like it was the right thing to do. So it positions us really well to be able to deliver the much-needed products to our customers. In the back half of the year and beyond and then on the payment plans which you know you touched upon Josh first brought this up when the coronavirus really started becoming problematic for our customers. There were concerns about budgets and we talked about, hey, look we're signing up multi-year contracts with our customers. We have long-standing relationships with them. We're going to have relationships that with them that will extend far beyond the coronavirus and so we want to make sure that we're doing right by them. And it's easier for us to get flexible on payment terms to help bridge them to a time when they are no longer -- they don't have concerns about budget and so when you have 5-10 year contracts you can get creative and that's what we've done; it's been fairly on a smaller scale. It's been fairly negligible across the entire portfolio of contracts, but it is something that we've offered in select cases.\nJosh Isner: Yes. I would just add to that and say like ultimately while there have been some data points to suggest individual customers asking for kind of a rework of their accounts receivable; it hasn't been very widespread. I personally attribute this to the fact that we have customers that are paying for value that we are delivering across our product lines; and we haven't seen any of these kind of ask like to push payments out multiple years or to not pay us for them anything for the next couple years. I think ultimately our customers are seeing value and what we're delivering and we're very honored to continue to provide that value to this market and only in very kind of edge cases have we had to entertain situations like that.\nJeremyHamblin: Great and then just a follow-up question here on your progress on federal contracts. In terms of thinking about the negotiations in those contracts; the tenure of the contracts. Are you seeing them extend longer when you're having discussions? Is it still somewhat early in the ramp of that channel of business? Are they looking to start shorter contracts and see how it goes and then get into some longer deals? Just any color you can share on progression there?\nJosh Isner: Sure thing. So a gentleman by the name of Richard Coleman has just done a fantastic job over the last couple of years building up our federal pipeline. And for the first time we are seeing customers willing to engage in multi-year engagements with us on both body cameras, but also on the Taser side. So we're very excited. There are -- it's not always easy to get federal customers to buy hardware and kind of annual phases as opposed to one-time purchases. So we're learning a little there and there is some of that but other federal agencies are heavily engaged in these five-year plans for both weapons and video. Federal takes time; it's a slog but for the first time in really 10 years here, I feel like we're starting to break through and crack the code of how to work with federal customers and that's largely due to Richard's contributions and hopefully we start to see a lot of that growth materialize over the next couple years here.\nAndreaJames: I think we want to get at least I think four more analysts. So we'll keep this going here. Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Go ahead Jonathan.\nJonathanHo: Okay. Can you hear me okay? Great. So just relative to I guess the current budget environment are you seeing traditional RFP processes perhaps start to stall and could that maybe open up some more opportunities for you to disrupt the traditional I guess RFP driven acquisition process for our RMS CAD?\nLukeLarson: Yes, great question, John. Then I think ultimately I haven't seen a huge change in procurement methods. I think some agencies still are issuing our fees; others are issuing so sources and others are issuing more like cooperative procurements or piggybacking off of other contracts that are already in place. And so I'm not sure a ton has changed there. I think the big thing for us is to focus on OSP 7 plus adoption because in that event the customer is already essentially getting the opportunity to deploy our RMS in that bundle and so the more we drive up OSP 7 plus procurements the more agencies are exposed to kind of our enterprise software before they make a formal buying decision. And so that's kind of how we're looking at things in terms of CAD and RMS. And I think that strategy is paying off. And we're seeing a lot of interest in those products via that purchasing mechanism. And certainly every day that goes by we're also getting closer to being ready to compete in RFPs for CAD and RMS to see Baltimore issued an RFI for RMS and we were victorious over some competitors that we have a lot of respect for in this market. So we're excited about where this business is going.\nJonathanHo: Got it and then just one for Jawad in terms of the decision to increase inventory, can you maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of what types of components you had concerns around and maybe what risks you're seeing around the supply chain? Thank you.\nLukeLarson: Yes. Maybe I'd lead off on that and then Jawad could add some additional context. So as we looked at really our kind of next 6 to 12 months based on our previous experience with really adjusting for tariffs. We wanted to make sure that we were going to be able to supply our customers with key products for two major upgrades AB3 as well as Taser 7. And so we made the decision to add additional inventory to ensure that we would have product on hand for those in addition to making sure that we would have a good buffer for any potential supply chain disruptions due to COVID. We also have a couple really, really big orders coming in Q3 that are kind of outside the context of our normal inventory build. I would let you know the majority of that inventory is going into finished goods, which is something that me and Josh Isner feel really strongly about, if we can build it up into a finished product; we're going to find a home for it. \nJawadAhsan: Yes, the only other thing I'd add from a financial standpoint. This doesn't happen often but there have been times when we've left revenue on the table at the end of a quarter because we didn't have inventory. And that's not a great thing to have happen especially when you've got the flexibility with our balance sheet to be able to have a bit of an inventory buffer. And so that's what we've committed to in addition to the factors that Luke mentioned, we never want to be in a position where we leave revenue on the table.\nAndreaJames: We'll take a question now from Will Power at Baird. Go ahead, Will.\nWilliamPower: Okay. Great. Thanks. Rick you suggested that it doesn't sound like we're seeing too much of a negative impact from some of the police defunding initiatives today. But I wonder if you could comment now that we're in the back half of the year on some of the early discussions with respect to municipal budgets, agency budgets for 2021. What's your sense for their expectations and how that could potentially blow through, if at all?\nRickSmith: Yes. I'm actually going to hand back to Josh because I think Josh is a little closer to the budgeting side of things. Josh, would you take that one?\nJosh Isner: Yes. Sure. So I appreciate the question. I think there has been some a reaction from some customers in this regard right. Like if you're a major city that relies heavily on tourism then certainly that's going to have an impact on how you think about budgeting for the next year. The good news here though is that customers are viewing our products as mission critical products; like the customers ,there's no willingness to not outfit police with tasers or body cams and of course computer-aided dispatch and RMS are also in that bucket. So I think there is some impact to budgets overall, but when you kind of look at it in terms of is there impact to the budgets that then impacts the products that customers buy from us. I'd say that's a lot less of the case.\nLukeLarson: Yes and I would just add another point there. I think if you look at our business maybe 10 years ago or even eight years ago, we were really dependent on one core market, our domestic market with one core product. And today we've got a lot of diversification not only in our product lines but also our geographical and even different market segments. And so as we see some puts and takes in different segments or products, we are seeing the evidence with international and some of these early other segments; we still feel really confident there.\nWilliamPower: Okay, well, it's good to hear. I guess just a quick follow-up question maybe circling back to international given the strength you've had last couple of quarters, any comments you can make with respect to pipeline from here? I'm guessing a lot of those deals you announced this quarter last when the pipeline prior to COVID, how much has COVID impacted in your ability to sell there? How does that then look over the next several quarters?\nLukeLarson: Yes. Thanks a lot. So there is going to be some lumpiness in international quarter-to-quarter, but on a year by year basis we still expect very encouraging double-digit growth out of our international revenue. COVID, it's impacted our ability to travel but in most of our key markets now we've got teams on the ground; so it's not like folks are having to travel on planes region to region. We do have teams built out in a lot of key places and distributors supporting us in a lot of key places. So ultimately the work that's gone into international started three -four years ago and so the things that are impacting the quarter results. These are things that teams have been working on for quarters and quarters already. So I would expect there's going to be some lumpiness in revenue quarter-to-quarter internationally, but I do have a lot of confidence that we're trending in a very, very strong direction both in terms of bookings and revenue internationally.\nAndreaJames: We'll take our next question from Brian Gesuale at Raymond James. Go ahead, Brian.\nBrianGesuale: Thanks Andr\u00e9a. Just wanted to ask a question on the net retention rate, which was a really good metric up 119% of net dollars. Can you maybe provide a little bit of color on how we might think of that between additional seats versus additional functionality that drives the incremental ARPU? And how we might want to think about that mix as we move forward?\nJawadAhsan: Yes. I'll start with that one. So that's a metric that we wanted to introduce for some time now; it's something we've been tracking for a while and we felt confident that you have enough data and enough sort of a history there to be able to start to publish it. And we feel very confident that number will hopefully tick up over time it's a dollar retention; it's not a user retention and so as our -- as we sign more OSP 7 plus contracts, which are of course at a much higher ARPU that number will start to tick up. We, at this point don't disclose ARPU because there's a lot of noise in that number certainly between domestic and international, but even within domestic we have different customers at different stages. So we're not yet ready to disclose the ARPU number. Does that help Brian? Is that what you're looking for?\nBrianGesuale: Yes. That's perfect. Maybe just to follow up a little bit. I wanted to just kind of revisit the gross margin kind of assumption for the third quarter. And I know you're not going beyond that but how might we think about the duration of these headwinds that you mentioned? I'm sure they're not all on a similar rhythm, but how we think they lift over time?\nJawadAhsan: Yes. Our expectation is that the one that we mentioned specifically for Q3 will be resolved within Q3; there may be a little bit of spillover into Q4 but it'll be on the order of magnitude of a couple of weeks. It's not going to materially impact Q4 and so at this point our best sort of outlook there is that it's going to be resolved within Q3. And then there are other, I wouldn't necessarily call them a headwind but we're still working very hard to get our gross margins up in the hardware business. That's something that obviously the more software we bring online that business is printing at 80% plus gross margin. So as more of our business shifts to software, our gross margins will lift there naturally.\nAndreaJames: Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer. We'll take your question.\nAndrewUerkwitz: Great. Thank you, guys. I appreciate the time. Could you help me understand that based on our research many of your RMS wins are more similar to the module, similar to what I think Jeff mentioned with Baltimore with the use of force. I assume the expectation is this will lead to kind of a rip and replace for the entire system. So one, am I thinking about this correctly? And then two, how does the accounting and pricing work over the life of a contract for a city that goes this route? And then lastly, kind of in that context Baltimore signed an OSP-7 contract a year ago and then they just recently announced that RMS module. Does that contract get reset? Does it get extended when something like that happens? There's ASP go up at that point, could you talk a little bit about the accounting and dynamics of when that happens? Thank you.\nRickSmith: Sure. I'll lead off overall and then let the other guys chime in. So first on the product point, we're like we said we're seeing a great pipeline of both committed existing commitments as well as the pipeline from here, both for full records deployments meaning the full replace of their legacy RMS, as well as standards which is that first module. And so for example just Baltimore since they've already made it public that's a commitment to move to records in its entirety and to fully replace their legacy RMS and we're seeing -- we are ahead of our expectations with RMS and we're seeing -- we are ahead of our expectations on the pipeline there, as well as of course a larger number of the standards ones. So we're seeing success on both and again ultimately our goal and we're confident of this outcome is that we're ultimately going to be on track to become the number one in this category for full records and standards is just a great part of the path to get there, because it's such an easy first step for getting for a given agency to take. And then I'll let Jawad give more color but fundamentally on the accounting, again specifically with regard to OSP 7 plus it is part of this overall primification of the way that public safety buys this technology, where just like for a subscription service like that where you are buying a thing that has many benefits to it regardless of whether and when you choose to adopt any given benefit.\nJawadAhsan: Yes then as far as how the accounting works, the revenue recognition; so we allocate a portion of the overall bundle to records and that portion we start recognizing once the customer has gone live. And let me stop there. Is that what you're looking for?\nAndrewUerkwitz: Yes. I think so and it -- does the contract reset then so like Baltimore signed for OSP-7, were they paying 199 a year ago or were they paying less than that and now that they're rolling out RMS, now they're moving up to that full price and because they kick that in there does that reset the contract where now it's five years from now as opposed to five years from a year ago?\nJosh Isner: So they're -- the price they paid last year is the same they paid this year with a couple notable exceptions. The first of which is the professional services to deploy RMS is a separate contract. So once they're ready to deploy, they would pay us for the professional services. The second one is they're going to add or they have added some more users because the OSP 7 plus often covers sworn officers that are carrying body cams and tasers but ultimately they're going to need more users to administer a lot of the elements of an RMS system and see that data and work with reports and so forth. So we do expect some user uptick as agencies start to deploy RMS. The third one is in Baltimore's case they actually did extend their contract as well to co term with some of their other items they have with us. And I think they extended out a couple years as part of that. So those are all dynamics that we expect to see, but I think the most important thing is we're betting on ourselves to be able to upsell additional new features outside of OSP 7 plus; two agencies that are deploying our RMS, so transcription is a great example of this. And Baltimore paid us additional monies per user to deploy transcription as part of their RMS service. And so for us, I think we do envision some of these kinds of value-added features on top of the OSP 7 deliverables as upsell opportunities as agencies deploy RMS.\nAndreaJames: We're going to go a little over and thanks guys for your patience. We'll take our next question that might be our final question from Pavan Kumar from Northland. \nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Yes. I disabled my video because I'm having some internet connectivity issue. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding R&D and SG&A spending as a percentage of revenue in second half and 2021, which areas or products would get most focus?\nJawadAhsan: Yes. I'll start with that and Jeff if you'd like to weigh in. So right now the majority of our R&D is being spent on software. We're very excited about what we've got in the pipeline from a software standpoint. As you saw quarter-to-quarter, our SG&A was actually flat and our R&D grew and that was very much by design. Our R&D growth well-based revenue growth this year, but at some point we have long-term targets that we've set of 30% on EBITDA and the way that we're going to get there is by allowing more of the revenue growth to fall to the bottom line. But overall the investments we're making in R&D we think are going to help pay off over a long horizon and get our -- keep our revenue growth rate above 20%.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Great and regarding competition like who are the competitors we are seeing most on the record city?\nJawadAhsan: Sorry -- with records competition, if I heard you correctly?\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Yes.\nJosh Isner: Yes. I think there are some competitors that I would characterize as companies that have been in the records business for a long time and a lot of them are incumbents and we have a lot of respect for those companies. We certainly believe kind of our new innovative approach to records will lead to customer adoption in times away from some of those products like we saw in Baltimore. And there are new entrants to the space as well and ultimately like with the combination of our channel coupled with the amount of investment and talent we're bringing on the product side. We think that we're really well positioned for the long term. I think for the newer competitors; certainly, they have more constraints around channel and spend than we might. And for some of the incumbent competitors they probably have a little more constraint around servicing existing customers as opposed to really innovating quickly. And so we view ourselves as a really disruptive entrant into this market. And we're very hopeful that we can become the market leader in due time.\nLukeLarson: Yes. That's right. I mean I think, first, we really like to say that we obsess first and foremost about our customers; we're happy to have our competitors obsess about us, but we like to focus on the customer. But exactly as Josh said overall both the legacy providers, as well as some of the new ones, Axon just has a pretty unique combination of assets that makes us different both in the legacy incumbents and the newer startups because the legacy incumbents are simply not Cloud forced, Cloud first and born in the cloud and you fundamentally can't deliver the kinds of results that the departments of today and tomorrow need without being born in the cloud. And on the other hand, the newer startups simply don't have the network of sensors and signals that are connected into services that can also do the same thing. We're really the only company that has that combination of both, which is why we're so excited about where we're ultimately going to deliver for customers in this category.\nAndrea James: I think that's all of our questions. I'm just looking at all of your screens here. Okay, let's have Rick close us out.\nRick Smith: All right. We're a little over. So let's keep it quick. Thank you everybody for joining us. We're confident we'll all look back on 2020 is the time that's set in motion. The next wave of policing reform and the next leg of growth for Axon. We hope to stay safe, healthy, and sane during this period of continued disruption. And we look forward to updating you on our progress against our mission in November. And don't forget to come to our Accelerate in a couple weeks. And you'll see a lot more detail on our product roadmap. Thanks and bye.",

            "name": "Jawad Ahsan",
            "content": "Thanks Luke. Our second quarter performance was a testament to our ability to deliver sharp execution in a challenging environment. Although demand remained robust, domestic customers were often banned with constraint. Dealing with COVID-19, personnel outages, employee safety concerns and caution about uncertain budgets. Even with these challenges, Q3 revenue is generally in line with our pre-pandemic expectations. Domestic body camera bookings remain strong and our international expansion continues to accelerate. Our results in the quarter speak to our resilience as a company and the critical importance of our products and our customers lives. A few years ago, we set out on a journey to transform into an enterprise software company that also sells devices. And our performance this past quarter further solidifies that path. High margin annual recurring revenue grew 42% to $183 million; software revenue was a record 30% of total sales and we sustained SaaS net revenue retention of 119% Turning to our outlook; we're watching to see whether states shut down in the fall, which could bring renewed caution on budgeting. There is just enough outside of our control regarding COVID-19 that we did not reinstate formal full-year guidance. We did provide a range that we are managing toward for Q3. There are two factors to keep in mind when considering our interim Q3 guidance. The first is that we made a strategic and intentional decision to prioritize growing our Cloud user base and adding nodes to our network in the early days of our Software and Sensors business. As a result, we have contracts with strategically important agencies both domestically and internationally that have served as beachhead accounts but come with a lower margin than average. The second factor is that the majority of our multi-year contracts come with hardware refreshes at periodic intervals, which come at a lower margin than the SaaS portion of these contracts. The confluence of these two factors will conspire in Q3 to be a headwind on our gross margins, which we expect will normalize by Q4, anticipating a question we often receive these days we are not seeing changes in buying activity due to police defunding concerns. In fact, we've seen some anecdotal acceleration of body camera buying decisions due to agencies wishing to provide transparency to the communities. We remain confident in our long-term, multi-year outlook. We're privileged to be working on solutions to some of society's most entrenched challenges. We're just getting started in several new markets internationally and in several new software product lines. Importantly, the addition of capital from our recent follow-up offering further strengthened our balance sheet and provides us with even greater flexibility to continue investing for growth. At quarter end, we had $675 million of cash and investments and zero debt. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to share some insight with you as to how we view the company relative to the investments we're making and where we're headed. The first phase of the company's growth let's call it Axon 1.0 saw us establishing the Taser business and building an unparalleled sales channel with law enforcement. The second phase of our growth Axon 2.0 saw us continuing to innovate with the introduction of smart devices including body-worn and in-car cameras, which integrated seamlessly with our customer focus cloud network. Now we're entering the next phase of our growth Axon 3.0. We're building a rapidly evolving public safety ecosystem with both connected devices and intuitive workflows powered by AI with the increasingly powerful Axon Cloud as our centerpiece. Our mission with this ecosystem is to protect life, capture truth and accelerate justice. Now more than ever society is driving towards these outcomes and Axon is uniquely positioned to partner with our customers and deliver on all three. And with that Andre\u0301a, let's move to questions. Yes. That was part of what we signaled with our Q3 guidance, Keith. we have some large international customers; we have a couple of international, sorry domestic customers that have we consider to be strategic beachhead accounts where the margins are lower on the camera contracts, and as those customers get the refreshes on their contracts in the quarters that we ship which Q3 happens to be one we're going to see lower margins, which is why we gave that specific guidance for Q3. Well, it's -- we are anticipating the EBITDA margins to be 12% on our Q3 revenues. We don't have formal guidance for the year. So I can't officially say what that impact is going to be. Yes. I'll tack team this Josh with you if that's all right, but we have a plan and operating plan for the year that informed our guidance. And that still pretty much informs what we're managing to. We outperformed in Q1 and Q2, we were very happy with the performance of our business and our sales team. The investments we've been making in international has been really paying off; some of these new markets, new products but we don't obviously bank on that and so we feel that it's prudent to stick relatively close to what our operating plan is which inform the 15% guidance. So I think from a booking's perspective, we do expect fleet three to be a contributor in the back half of the year. I think there's still some question about shipping fleet three and shipments depending on how well the TNES [Indiscernible] 0:33:00.4 go might end up in the front half of 2021 as opposed to the back half of 2020. We don't expect that to have much of an impact on revenue and bookings like I said given the fact that we'll be doing TNES contribute to bookings that we feel great about Fleet 2 has really stabilized in the last couple quarters in terms of customer satisfaction and so forth. And we're excited to build on that momentum as we launch Fleet 3, certainly the ALPR and modular capabilities of Fleet 3 where we can do 360 degree recording around the car and so forth are things our customers are excited about. And we absolutely are confident that we're going to get a great customer reaction from this product and be followed by bookings and revenue associated with it. And the key Josh mentioned this in addition to it being our best ever in-vehicle camera system straight up as camera system it will also be the launch, as we've said before of our approach, our pretty disruptive and novel approach to the automatic license plate recognition category and mobile where fundamentally it's different than the way it's done today in the market by being disruptively more affordable and better more cost effective for better performance and results by making it a thing that departments can put in every single police vehicle as opposed to a small number of very expensive purpose-built cameras. And of course no matter how good any one camera is it can only be in one place. And then you combine that with it being built from the ground up with ethics and privacy in mind. And our strategic partnership with flock safety for a similar approach for fixed ALPR cameras. We really think it's a watershed change in the way ALPR as a category will work. Yes, the only other thing I'd add from a financial standpoint. This doesn't happen often but there have been times when we've left revenue on the table at the end of a quarter because we didn't have inventory. And that's not a great thing to have happen especially when you've got the flexibility with our balance sheet to be able to have a bit of an inventory buffer. And so that's what we've committed to in addition to the factors that Luke mentioned, we never want to be in a position where we leave revenue on the table. Yes. I'll start with that one. So that's a metric that we wanted to introduce for some time now; it's something we've been tracking for a while and we felt confident that you have enough data and enough sort of a history there to be able to start to publish it. And we feel very confident that number will hopefully tick up over time it's a dollar retention; it's not a user retention and so as our -- as we sign more OSP 7 plus contracts, which are of course at a much higher ARPU that number will start to tick up. We, at this point don't disclose ARPU because there's a lot of noise in that number certainly between domestic and international, but even within domestic we have different customers at different stages. So we're not yet ready to disclose the ARPU number. Does that help Brian? Is that what you're looking for? Yes. Our expectation is that the one that we mentioned specifically for Q3 will be resolved within Q3; there may be a little bit of spillover into Q4 but it'll be on the order of magnitude of a couple of weeks. It's not going to materially impact Q4 and so at this point our best sort of outlook there is that it's going to be resolved within Q3. And then there are other, I wouldn't necessarily call them a headwind but we're still working very hard to get our gross margins up in the hardware business. That's something that obviously the more software we bring online that business is printing at 80% plus gross margin. So as more of our business shifts to software, our gross margins will lift there naturally. Yes then as far as how the accounting works, the revenue recognition; so we allocate a portion of the overall bundle to records and that portion we start recognizing once the customer has gone live. And let me stop there. Is that what you're looking for? Yes. I'll start with that and Jeff if you'd like to weigh in. So right now the majority of our R&D is being spent on software. We're very excited about what we've got in the pipeline from a software standpoint. As you saw quarter-to-quarter, our SG&A was actually flat and our R&D grew and that was very much by design. Our R&D growth well-based revenue growth this year, but at some point we have long-term targets that we've set of 30% on EBITDA and the way that we're going to get there is by allowing more of the revenue growth to fall to the bottom line. But overall the investments we're making in R&D we think are going to help pay off over a long horizon and get our -- keep our revenue growth rate above 20%. Sorry -- with records competition, if I heard you correctly?"

            "content": "Thanks Rick. In a few weeks on August 25th as Rick mentioned, we'll be hosting our Annual Technology Summit Axon Accelerate. Due to COVID, we've shifted this to a virtual event which has allowed us to grow the event to reach a much bigger scale of our audience and customers. We're also able to offer a cutting edge virtual reality track. If you'd like to attend go to axon.com and register. We're very excited to share some key customer updates and product announcements on how Axon can help officers and the communities they serve ensure everyone makes it home safe. Our strategic priorities in 2020 are to continue to execute in our core market, while accelerating our path to market in new product categories. Our engineering and product teams are solving some of the most difficult problems at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds to advance our mission. This is also a year where we have walked beside our customers in one of the most challenging environments they have ever faced. Our customer facing teams have built amazing relationships with our customers not by selling devices or software but by becoming trusted advisors on how we can help customers with the important problems they are facing. We are helping them to source mission critical technology amid greater public budget scrutiny; helping them to access federal dollars where available and we aspire to be true partners to our customers. We are emphasizing the mission critical importance of our OSP 7 plus offering de-escalation, transparency and productivity have never been more critical to police and community relations during this watershed moment. And our offerings address these exact situations. This emphasis drove our Q2 results with revenue up 26% year-over-year. This is a strong performance in the context of one of the toughest macros we've faced, a global pandemic and massive economic uncertainty. Our strong results were also driven by a stellar quarter for international up 80% year-over-year to $34 million. This was on top of 38% international revenue growth in Q1. We were just getting started in large markets such as Brazil and India and three countries top $1 million in revenue for the first time in the quarter. Indonesia, Panama and Thailand. Turning to the bottom line GAAP income was affected by stock-based compensation and tax expense; adjusted EBITDA was $28 million reflecting a 20% margin which showcases our cost discipline and some travel savings related to COVID. Turning to operations; you will see the inventory build on our balance sheet. This was very intentional. We have adopted well -- we have adapted well to an ongoing supply chain environment that we've never seen. Recall that last year we diversified our supply chain and global manufacturing footprint due to tariffs and it turns out that those initiatives positioned us well to handle COVID-19; even so given the number of unforeseen challenges that could lay ahead and the fact that 2020 is full of curveballs, we've elevated our inventory build in the first half. This safety stock helps minimize shipping disruptions and also prepares us for some key Axon Body 3 shipments to major customers in Q3 and Taser orders we are expected to fulfill in the back half of the year. Currently, we expect Q3 inventory levels to remain about the same and by the end of the year they could come down by as much as 10%. And with that I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jawad. That's right and Joe I think how we talked about when we last spoke about when you think about something like dispatch and you think about something like Axon Aware and building geo relocation and live streaming into our cameras really being part of a bigger mission for agencies around real-time operations and broadening that lens. This is exactly the perfect scenario for which that is purpose-built. And so even right out of the box the integration of acts on dispatch and Axon Aware bringing together the ability to bring other kinds of resources into an incident in real time is a capability that is just native to our Cloud-borne approach to all of these categories. Yes and specifically on the pipeline; I would say we are seeing more and more agencies interested in OSP 7 plus and we're seeing some acceleration from the agencies that bought OSP-7 plus last year in adopting our standards module of records, as well as a lot of the other key modules like reporting and so forth. So I'm very confident in our team to be able to convert some of those OSP 7 plus opportunities into RMS deployments. We're very focused on and we're very focused on making sure that customers are valuing and adopting all of the benefits in OSP 7 plus, and this is a place where I think certainly the combination of having a very, very strong product organization with a very, very strong channel should lead to outsized results down the road. Yes. Thanks Charlie. We've got a lot of domestic sales people and leaders on the call here that hopefully are motivated by that question and we certainly expect a great back half from our domestic and international teams. I think there was, if you look back at it we lost about half the Q2 due to the pandemic shutdown; everyone was trying to figure out how to conduct like city council meetings and really conduct business on Zoom for the first time. And that certainly slowed down some of our momentum in the first half of Q2 and then really in June, we lost about two weeks due to the kind of civil unrest and the events that followed the killing of George Floyd. So I would look at Q2 more as just kind of a unique point in time due to some external factors that slowed us down a little domestically, but we have high expectations of our team and they're very motivated to turn that trend around in Q3 both domestically and internationally. And just add one clarifying comment there. So we're going to be in some pretty in-depth trials in the back after this year but we don't expect to be in full production ramp of Fleet 3 until 2021 and that's where we'll see the real growth contribution. Yes, great question, John. Then I think ultimately I haven't seen a huge change in procurement methods. I think some agencies still are issuing our fees; others are issuing so sources and others are issuing more like cooperative procurements or piggybacking off of other contracts that are already in place. And so I'm not sure a ton has changed there. I think the big thing for us is to focus on OSP 7 plus adoption because in that event the customer is already essentially getting the opportunity to deploy our RMS in that bundle and so the more we drive up OSP 7 plus procurements the more agencies are exposed to kind of our enterprise software before they make a formal buying decision. And so that's kind of how we're looking at things in terms of CAD and RMS. And I think that strategy is paying off. And we're seeing a lot of interest in those products via that purchasing mechanism. And certainly every day that goes by we're also getting closer to being ready to compete in RFPs for CAD and RMS to see Baltimore issued an RFI for RMS and we were victorious over some competitors that we have a lot of respect for in this market. So we're excited about where this business is going. Yes. Maybe I'd lead off on that and then Jawad could add some additional context. So as we looked at really our kind of next 6 to 12 months based on our previous experience with really adjusting for tariffs. We wanted to make sure that we were going to be able to supply our customers with key products for two major upgrades AB3 as well as Taser 7. And so we made the decision to add additional inventory to ensure that we would have product on hand for those in addition to making sure that we would have a good buffer for any potential supply chain disruptions due to COVID. We also have a couple really, really big orders coming in Q3 that are kind of outside the context of our normal inventory build. I would let you know the majority of that inventory is going into finished goods, which is something that me and Josh Isner feel really strongly about, if we can build it up into a finished product; we're going to find a home for it. Yes and I would just add another point there. I think if you look at our business maybe 10 years ago or even eight years ago, we were really dependent on one core market, our domestic market with one core product. And today we've got a lot of diversification not only in our product lines but also our geographical and even different market segments. And so as we see some puts and takes in different segments or products, we are seeing the evidence with international and some of these early other segments; we still feel really confident there. Yes. Thanks a lot. So there is going to be some lumpiness in international quarter-to-quarter, but on a year by year basis we still expect very encouraging double-digit growth out of our international revenue. COVID, it's impacted our ability to travel but in most of our key markets now we've got teams on the ground; so it's not like folks are having to travel on planes region to region. We do have teams built out in a lot of key places and distributors supporting us in a lot of key places. So ultimately the work that's gone into international started three -four years ago and so the things that are impacting the quarter results. These are things that teams have been working on for quarters and quarters already. So I would expect there's going to be some lumpiness in revenue quarter-to-quarter internationally, but I do have a lot of confidence that we're trending in a very, very strong direction both in terms of bookings and revenue internationally. Yes. That's right. I mean I think, first, we really like to say that we obsess first and foremost about our customers; we're happy to have our competitors obsess about us, but we like to focus on the customer. But exactly as Josh said overall both the legacy providers, as well as some of the new ones, Axon just has a pretty unique combination of assets that makes us different both in the legacy incumbents and the newer startups because the legacy incumbents are simply not Cloud forced, Cloud first and born in the cloud and you fundamentally can't deliver the kinds of results that the departments of today and tomorrow need without being born in the cloud. And on the other hand, the newer startups simply don't have the network of sensors and signals that are connected into services that can also do the same thing. We're really the only company that has that combination of both, which is why we're so excited about where we're ultimately going to deliver for customers in this category."

            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Andre\u0301a. And thank you everyone for joining us today. During our last quarterly update in May, one of the biggest issues we addressed was how we were managing our business through a pandemic. One quarter later we have so much more to talk about because we've all watched thousands of people take to the streets demanding police and public safety reform. Our company's reason to exist, our mission is for exactly moments like right now, protect life. We are on a mission to make energy weapons so safe and so effective that we make bullets obsolete. We preserve truth; body cameras protect officers to bad claims and citizens from bad behavior. Increasing transparency and reducing social conflict. We accelerate justice with advanced cloud software and AI that have potential to make the entire justice system more fair and more effective. When you think of gun violence, social conflict and a fair justice system, most people don't think of these as technology problems but it's political problems. We frame them as problems where technology can play a transformative role. Now look technology is no panacea and it cannot solve these problems for us. However, almost any problem can be solved faster and more effectively with the right technology tools to help people solve them. So as we look at all the pain and anger today, we ask ourselves what we can do to help promote equity. Our superpower is creating technology to address social problems that many others see as intractable. So we've added a fourth mission to inspire our work; centering racial equity inclusion and diversity, which might make you, wonder how you can build technology to promote equity. If you want to hear specific examples of how we are using technology to support this new mission, you'll have to wait and come join us at our conference Accelerate later this month. We made Axon can't change the policies and cultural norms in policing, but we can build the tech tools to help our customers do it. We're hearing consistent and emphatic calls for change from the most prominent leaders of law enforcement and we are excited to build the tools to help them. Back when we began investing in body cameras in 2008, we faced innumerable skeptics we faced numerous skeptics. But, we knew that body cameras were the future. And body cameras started gaining traction after a wave of protests began in Ferguson Missouri in 2014, which was really the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement. At the time, we were delivering the right capabilities at the right time and our investments in cloud software made body cameras suddenly feasible and affordable for all agencies. We invested in body cameras when nobody believed they were possible and as the investment community well knows our core body camera and software business lost money from 2008 to 2019 when it began to turn a profit. Those 11 years of continuous investment in R&D to prove out the feasibility and sustainability of body cameras are now the foundation for our next leg of growth. In 2020, we're humbled to be developing solutions that once again find themselves relevant to a national conversation about policing. We do not shy away from these hard discussions and we see the pain and the nuance behind demands to defund police. This is really all about reforming and reshaping the justice system. And these are issues that we engage with daily. They're not new to us. We invite input from a broad spectrum of voices; we have the industry's most relevant and productive ethics board with renewed calls for reform we can leverage technology and policy changes to improve public safety. We believe that our product moment fit is why our pipeline continues to strengthen as communities see the power of our platform to drive positive change. And now with that I'm going to turn over to our President, Luke Larson. Well, I would say the best answer to that question will be if you tune in to Accelerate; we have some pretty significant new announcements, and we'll be showcasing some new capabilities that will have a big impact on efficiency. One of which we've been in field trials that'll go -- it's going into full release and I can tell you that one agency in Canada was testing one of those capabilities that was absolutely transformative; they had two homicides happening in a short period of time and for a small agency these great tremendous levels of workload and one of our new AI products actually helped them handle two simultaneously. That they said without us they would have been at risk actually potentially having those cases at risk of getting disqualified because they would not have been able to process all the paperwork and evidence data and meet the judicial deadlines. So stay tuned and Accelerate for more but both records and dispatch are live in the field and we're now beginning to start really linking some of the AI capabilities to power the creation of the structured data in those systems from the unstructured data we capture with our body cameras. Josh, why don't you start answering that as a head of sales? Yes. I think it'd just be pretty speculative for us to speculate on what might go in there, obviously, if there's a lot of money specifically earmarked to state and local agencies; we suspect in this environment that it would end up being focused towards a lot of the transparency tools things we're doing with body cameras et cetera. We've also seen a lot of interest in corrections growing around the Taser weapons because COVID-19 still remains a big issue and particularly in confined environments. So there's more focus on maintaining safe distances, traditionally in corrections if you have an inmate that decides that they're going to become resistant to following the procedures they have to that is meant correctional officers suiting up and having to go hands-on in a very close personal; you're covered in each other's sweat and other things you really worry about. So our plan does not account for any additional federal funding, if it comes in I think there could be a little bit of upside, but I wouldn't -- again I don't respectfully too much. Yes. Let me take that one. So first of all I had a really interesting call with a major city Police Chief where we were talking about the defunding phenomenon and what happened and what he related to me was actually they did reassign portions of his budget to other portions of the city, so basically they just shifted some resources out of police to other city agencies. And then his net budget was actually increased fairly significantly for body cameras and transparency tools; so in that respect he was pleasantly surprised that the whole defunding discussion actually led for their agency to a better place; allowed them to focus in on their function a bit more reliance and partner agencies within the city to take a little more of the load and ultimately give them a little more budget for tech. Now ultimately, we'll see how this plays out in other agencies but we believe that this idea that right now law enforcement, they're doing a lot of social services. They're dealing with homeless people and mental health issues because you pick up the phone and you dial 911 for a lot of things that maybe don't need a cop. And so as we think about our dispatch software what a great time to be introducing a new cloud-based dispatch capability, where we can obviously shift our roadmap and be looking at introducing new features things that would allow agencies to perhaps integrate better with other city agencies that might not traditionally be dispatched oriented tight folks to use some of our communication tools in ways that would allow the dispatchers to dispatch non-sworn officers to different types of events. So we tend to love change as an organization and times are changing rapidly here and we view that our DNA sets us up well to move quickly to new opportunities. Absolutely. We're seeing also not only the ability for non-sworn officers to be able to use cameras but for sworn officers to be able to live stream with folks like mental health experts that can be helping them in real time dealing with complex situations, where those officers might need more expertise. But we actually think this could open up some education areas particularly if you have unarmed non-sworn people; your ability to identify emerging dangers becomes even more important because you have to rapidly route armed officers to the scene to help out. Sure. I'll take that and -- to Josh. --Or different -- [Multiple Speakers] Yes. I got it. I can't help but smile. I remember the days we were struggling to pay the light bill and putting stuff on credit cards. And now we've got almost $700 million in cash. I would also say that historically as I'm a skeptic on M&A that I think I'm a Chicago school guy, markets are pretty efficient, M&A a lot of times it always drives up the price of the acquired frequently to the detriment of the acquirer and we still approach M&A from that position that it has to be unquestionably more valuable as a part of our ecosystem than as a standalone in order for an acquisition to make sense for all the headaches that come with integrating different companies. That being said, I think we are in a unique position where we have built and we now have this fairly ubiquitous cloud software and connected hardware ecosystem that make things like partnerships flock safety become pretty powerful, as well as we are really building out our M&A function; it's actually under Andre\u0301a James who's doing a fantastic job. We've been building out a team but either we get a ton of inbound inquiries and the vast majority of the time we say no because we are on a mission. We've got a lot of focus but we are starting to see -- there are things that will be interesting partnerships and there are some things that could be interesting acquisitions. And we have plenty of cash to have the flexibility to do it when it makes sense, but just want to reassure you we start from the position of no and that we have to overcome some pretty skeptical hurdles before we're going to spend the money, you our shareholders gave us; we're going to treat it very carefully. As if it's the same money I was using to pay those late bills 25 years ago. Yes. I'll start with this one. So one of the things I love about our cash balance in our position our balance sheet is the optionality it provides us and Jeremy you've honed in on a couple of things that we've been able to do with that optionality. One is of course the inventory build; it was a material amount of cash in the quarter. We felt like it was the right thing to do. So it positions us really well to be able to deliver the much-needed products to our customers. In the back half of the year and beyond and then on the payment plans which you know you touched upon Josh first brought this up when the coronavirus really started becoming problematic for our customers. There were concerns about budgets and we talked about, hey, look we're signing up multi-year contracts with our customers. We have long-standing relationships with them. We're going to have relationships that with them that will extend far beyond the coronavirus and so we want to make sure that we're doing right by them. And it's easier for us to get flexible on payment terms to help bridge them to a time when they are no longer -- they don't have concerns about budget and so when you have 5-10 year contracts you can get creative and that's what we've done; it's been fairly on a smaller scale. It's been fairly negligible across the entire portfolio of contracts, but it is something that we've offered in select cases. Yes. I'm actually going to hand back to Josh because I think Josh is a little closer to the budgeting side of things. Josh, would you take that one? Sure. I'll lead off overall and then let the other guys chime in. So first on the product point, we're like we said we're seeing a great pipeline of both committed existing commitments as well as the pipeline from here, both for full records deployments meaning the full replace of their legacy RMS, as well as standards which is that first module. And so for example just Baltimore since they've already made it public that's a commitment to move to records in its entirety and to fully replace their legacy RMS and we're seeing -- we are ahead of our expectations with RMS and we're seeing -- we are ahead of our expectations on the pipeline there, as well as of course a larger number of the standards ones. So we're seeing success on both and again ultimately our goal and we're confident of this outcome is that we're ultimately going to be on track to become the number one in this category for full records and standards is just a great part of the path to get there, because it's such an easy first step for getting for a given agency to take. And then I'll let Jawad give more color but fundamentally on the accounting, again specifically with regard to OSP 7 plus it is part of this overall primification of the way that public safety buys this technology, where just like for a subscription service like that where you are buying a thing that has many benefits to it regardless of whether and when you choose to adopt any given benefit. All right. We're a little over. So let's keep it quick. Thank you everybody for joining us. We're confident we'll all look back on 2020 is the time that's set in motion. The next wave of policing reform and the next leg of growth for Axon. We hope to stay safe, healthy, and sane during this period of continued disruption. And we look forward to updating you on our progress against our mission in November. And don't forget to come to our Accelerate in a couple weeks. And you'll see a lot more detail on our product roadmap. Thanks and bye."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks very much James for the question. Ultimately, I think we see a lot of similarities regarding where international is now versus where domestic was four or five years ago, and we're very much following the same playbook. We're going to be focused on fewer markets than the entire world and we're going to continue to build out a few markets at a time over the next few years. I think the investments we made in our Tier 1 markets a couple years ago building really talented teams there, focusing on expanding both Taser and getting our early body camera and deems customers there are why you're starting to receive the revenue results now and as we continue to build bookings up internationally, we expect revenue to follow in future years. So our focus is to build very, very talented teams in the markets that we see as potential movers; and we'll start to introduce some of our newer products into those markets that are already showing great results. And as more and more markets kind of come up to speed, we'll introduce our newer and newer products as those markets become larger markets and deployments of body cams and Tasers. I'll go ahead and take that. So I love that question and so again like we talked about last quarter, we're thrilled that well more than a dozen agencies are already live signed or being actively deployed on records using one or more modules of product. And we're incredibly confident of the trajectory as you've seen with the Baltimore announcement both committed adoptions among OSP customers, as well as continuing interest for the pipeline beyond that, continue to accelerate well ahead of even our expectations. And I think the two key things at play there like we talked about before the first is the power of the bundle makes it an easy choice for them to take advantage of that benefit at a perceived value point that goes hand in hand with what they're already paying for because it's effectively -- it's already included with the money they've already committed to. And then second is this key notion that we've talked about of Axon standards which is this use of force reporting module. And what's beautiful about standards is that it just so happens in records that every agency has to use of force reporting but they typically use a third party module for it. They don't actually use their historical RMS, but because standards is built right into Axon records it's the perfect first experience that they can use it as and rather than and or with their legacy RMS to begin getting value out of it right away with incredible easy deployment and then from there decide when they're ready to migrate their entire RMS; and that's exactly what happened with Cincinnati and we're seeing that same pattern play out as we go forward because it's incredibly easy to deploy; it works side by side with what they've already got and then as they come to love it whenever they're ready they can quickly decide to adopt full records for their entire RMS needs. Yes. Ultimately there are going to be some quarters that have higher revenue growth rates than others. And we feel good about full year. We feel good about kind of our long-term trajectory, but we do view this year as being back half weighted compared to the front half. And it just might be an issue between what comes in at Q3 and what comes in at Q4 of our kind of large CW deal pipeline. Hey, Mark. Great to see you again and thanks for the questions. So ultimately, I think it's a combination of a few things. Certainly as we open up new international markets, those first time orders are probably not going to be on recurring payment plans. That's due to our -- we want to make sure we have the ability to collect on all these plans and when we enter markets for the first time, we'd like to see some payment history there first. So that those will be kind of one-time contributors to revenue and we expect those to continue from newer markets, as well as markets making their second and third buys in their Taser programs. The teams have done an awesome job especially in the UK, in Canada driving most of our new deals towards subscriptions. In the UK, I believe almost every or every department is already on a Taser payment plan as opposed to one-time purchases. I think we'll see more of that in Australia over the next 12-months as T-7 starts to get legs there and same in Canada. And so I think in our more established international markets, we'll definitely see more recurring payments on CWS and video alike. And in our newer kind of first and second time buyer type markets those will be driven by more one-time revenue transactions there as we ship those new weapons, Yes. I would just add to that and say like ultimately while there have been some data points to suggest individual customers asking for kind of a rework of their accounts receivable; it hasn't been very widespread. I personally attribute this to the fact that we have customers that are paying for value that we are delivering across our product lines; and we haven't seen any of these kind of ask like to push payments out multiple years or to not pay us for them anything for the next couple years. I think ultimately our customers are seeing value and what we're delivering and we're very honored to continue to provide that value to this market and only in very kind of edge cases have we had to entertain situations like that. Sure thing. So a gentleman by the name of Richard Coleman has just done a fantastic job over the last couple of years building up our federal pipeline. And for the first time we are seeing customers willing to engage in multi-year engagements with us on both body cameras, but also on the Taser side. So we're very excited. There are -- it's not always easy to get federal customers to buy hardware and kind of annual phases as opposed to one-time purchases. So we're learning a little there and there is some of that but other federal agencies are heavily engaged in these five-year plans for both weapons and video. Federal takes time; it's a slog but for the first time in really 10 years here, I feel like we're starting to break through and crack the code of how to work with federal customers and that's largely due to Richard's contributions and hopefully we start to see a lot of that growth materialize over the next couple years here. Yes. Sure. So I appreciate the question. I think there has been some a reaction from some customers in this regard right. Like if you're a major city that relies heavily on tourism then certainly that's going to have an impact on how you think about budgeting for the next year. The good news here though is that customers are viewing our products as mission critical products; like the customers ,there's no willingness to not outfit police with tasers or body cams and of course computer-aided dispatch and RMS are also in that bucket. So I think there is some impact to budgets overall, but when you kind of look at it in terms of is there impact to the budgets that then impacts the products that customers buy from us. I'd say that's a lot less of the case. So they're -- the price they paid last year is the same they paid this year with a couple notable exceptions. The first of which is the professional services to deploy RMS is a separate contract. So once they're ready to deploy, they would pay us for the professional services. The second one is they're going to add or they have added some more users because the OSP 7 plus often covers sworn officers that are carrying body cams and tasers but ultimately they're going to need more users to administer a lot of the elements of an RMS system and see that data and work with reports and so forth. So we do expect some user uptick as agencies start to deploy RMS. The third one is in Baltimore's case they actually did extend their contract as well to co term with some of their other items they have with us. And I think they extended out a couple years as part of that. So those are all dynamics that we expect to see, but I think the most important thing is we're betting on ourselves to be able to upsell additional new features outside of OSP 7 plus; two agencies that are deploying our RMS, so transcription is a great example of this. And Baltimore paid us additional monies per user to deploy transcription as part of their RMS service. And so for us, I think we do envision some of these kinds of value-added features on top of the OSP 7 deliverables as upsell opportunities as agencies deploy RMS. Yes. I think there are some competitors that I would characterize as companies that have been in the records business for a long time and a lot of them are incumbents and we have a lot of respect for those companies. We certainly believe kind of our new innovative approach to records will lead to customer adoption in times away from some of those products like we saw in Baltimore. And there are new entrants to the space as well and ultimately like with the combination of our channel coupled with the amount of investment and talent we're bringing on the product side. We think that we're really well positioned for the long term. I think for the newer competitors; certainly, they have more constraints around channel and spend than we might. And for some of the incumbent competitors they probably have a little more constraint around servicing existing customers as opposed to really innovating quickly. And so we view ourselves as a really disruptive entrant into this market. And we're very hopeful that we can become the market leader in due time."

Thank you for joining us today. Today we have available Axon CEO, Rick Smith; President, Luke Larson; CFO, Jawad Ahsan; Chief Revenue Officer, Josh Isner; and Chief Product Officer, Jeff Kunins. We\u2019re really pleased to bring you the whole team. This team has done dozens of earnings calls together as a public company, but this is the first one where we\u2019re all in a different location. Just like you, we\u2019re all adapting. And we thank our analysts and our investor\u2019s for joining us today over Zoom. We do appreciate that today is a particularly crowded earnings day and I know there\u2019s a lot of calls going on right now. Our company has really embraced video conferencing technology to keep connected. We\u2019re using custom Zoom backgrounds today and you\u2019ll see seven of them with our executives. Five of the backgrounds are actual offices of Axon, all around the world, and then two of them are not real backgrounds. So if our analysts, if you\u2019re joining us today, if you want to guess at which backgrounds are not real, we\u2019ll send you some Axon flag if you get it right. Okay, so today, first management will give prepared remarks and then we will bring our analysts on camera for questions. Analysts, your lines will be muted until it\u2019s time to ask a question. Please ask two questions and if you have a follow-up you can let us know via the chat window. We\u2019ll circle back around depending on time. Axon\u2019s moderators, Mark, Doug and Angel will be unmuting your lines when we call on you. And if you get into trouble, type your question in the chat window and we\u2019ll read it aloud. I hope you\u2019ve all had a chance to read our shareholder letter, which was released after the market closed. You can find it at investor.axon.com and our remarks today are meant to build upon the information in that robust letter. If for some reason there is an internet outage beyond our control or we lose Zoom connectivity, we\u2019ll make every effort to post a copy of our prepared remarks to investor.axon.com this evening. During this call we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made today are pursuant to and within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These comments are based on the predictions and expectations as of today. They are not guarantees of future performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are discussed in our SEC filings. All right, now let\u2019s hear from Rick.\nRick Smith: Awesome. Thanks, Andrea, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We last spoke to you on our Q4 update call on February 27, and what now feels like a very different world, where people ate in restaurants and flew to business meetings and vacations. Three days later we curbed all non-essential travel for our employees, but our message to our team was very clear that we may curb travel or work from home; it does not mean that we are reducing the vigor with which we pursue our mission. Far from it, we are aggressively adapting to new conditions in the world as we Zoom into all our meetings and we will seek opportunities to use this changing environment to leverage our superior adaptability to gain ground against less agile competitors. In the past weeks, Axon has brought forth some major initiatives to address this crisis, including giving free global access to Axon Citizen for the remainder of 2020, and using our supply chain to source PPE for first responders in a nationwide campaign and partnership with the National Police Foundation, which even got the attention of Vice President, Pence, who tweeted about it. A large number of Axon employees donated money or personal time to this cause. Our first responders still face significant risks and we are continuing to match donations for PPE. If you, our investors, are able to support the cause, please do. Help us protect those who keep us safe. Go to axon.com/covid and scroll down and hit the Donate Now button. Even though I\u2019ve been working from home and getting a lot more time with my kids, including some pedicures for my daughter, Fortnite lessons from my son and helping film product demos with my teenager, I personally have had more face time with customers over Zoom than I\u2019ve ever had, even in person. I\u2019ve been doing about five different Zoom customer meetings a day, and that\u2019s far higher than was possible when we had to travel in person meetings. So my personal customer engagement velocity is way up. And Jawad and I will be attending more investor conferences this quarter than at any time in the past years as we can now Zoom into those as well. We\u2019re proud to be thought leaders on driving technology adoption, and I\u2019m pleased to see how well our customers have adapted to using this technology to be increasingly productive. I was on three customer meetings earlier today and most of them had never used video conferencing before the COVID crisis and now it\u2019s become standard. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m learning from those customers and what they\u2019re telling me. They\u2019re working with reduced staff due to personnel being and safety. Customers are seeing this crisis. It\u2019s forcing them to adapt and change more rapidly than ever and technology will play an even larger role as a cornerstone in every new business process needed in the world post-COVID. Whether it\u2019s using Axon Citizen to gather evidence from the public or our prosecutor portal for sharing digital evidence with prosecutors and courts, the world is changing and Axon thrives on change. We\u2019re even helping some key industry thought leadership group replaced their canceled conferences and move them online. Luckily we have a bit of a reputation for being both innovative and pretty good at throwing great events, so we\u2019re loading our expertise to industry partners to help them thrive in this new world with us. Now let\u2019s talk about the future. Our best estimates for the year remain unchanged and our pipeline remains strong. However, customers are relating to us that they\u2019re facing large budget shortfalls and uncertainty in the macro environment unlike anything any of us who\u2019ve ever seen. Currently our sales pipeline remains solid, but we cannot see over the horizon any better than the rest of you to know how the economy will shake out or if the federal government will step in to provide additional aid to state and local governments. Giving guidance implies a level of certainty that is simply not possible to ascertain right now. To be blunt, in an environment where we see so many companies acknowledging the uncertainties ahead by pulling formal guidance, we believe it would be most prudent to recharacterize our best estimates to acknowledge the higher than normal uncertainty. Hence, we\u2019re telling shareholders that even though our business has been very resilient today and our best estimates have not changed, the level of uncertainty has increased to a level where we are no longer comfortable characterizing those estimates as guidance until the macro environment stabilizes. We don\u2019t want to imply that we know something the rest of the world doesn\u2019t, namely how the economy will unfold in the coming months. We do have Chief Revenue Officer, Josh Isner on the line, and during the Q&A he can speak to the strength of our pipeline if you\u2019re interested. All that said, I couldn\u2019t be more bullish on Axon. We are change agents. Our adaptability and innovation centric approaches are unique advantages for us when the world changes rapidly as this is happening right now. This isn\u2019t the first time Axon has faced adversity. Myself, our President, our Chief Revenue Officer, we\u2019re all together managing through the last recession from which we emerged far stronger. In 2008, as the financial crisis ripped the world, we decided to lean in and transform our entire business from being a simple TASER device manufacturing business into an integrated tech company making wearables and cloud software. That transition was anything than easy and we\u2019ve had many difficult learning curves to overcome. But as competitors in the public safety space retreated, that\u2019s exactly when we advanced into new opportunities and we established ourselves as the clear market leader in cloud hosted digital evidence management software and camera sensors. In the past year, we\u2019ve now shipped two major software products, Axon Records, which is now live or signed with in-flight deployments at more than a dozen agencies; and Axon Dispatch, we just went live at our first customer. Today Axon is stronger than ever. We ended Q1 with nearly $400 million in cash and equivalents, zero debt and an underlying business that generates strong cash flow and high margin recurring revenues. Our Q1 revenue grew 27% year-over-year. And while net income was affected by stock-based compensation expense, our adjusted EBITDA more than doubled year-over-year to $30 million, reflecting a 20% margin. We have several moonshots in progress. Before this decade is out, we will launch a TASER weapon that will outperform a 9 millimeter pistol\u2019s stopping power. We will continue to make policing transparent and effective. And we will extend our reach across the criminal justice system, making it both more fair and more efficient. We will continue to create great social value or society and great value for you, our shareholders. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President, Luke Larson. Luke?\nLuke Larson: Thanks, Rick. Since COVID as a leadership team, we\u2019ve been laser-focused on three key priorities; number one, the health and safety of our employees; number two, doing our part to help flatten the curve; and number three, keeping key initiatives going to support our customers. I want to give a shout out to all of Axon\u2019s employees. They\u2019ve really stepped up the last two months. I want to give a specific shout out to Josh Goldman, our VP of Ops; Elizabeth Hart, who heads up our people team; and our entire IT team, for their ability to shift our entire workforce to work from home for all of our knowledge workers as well as keeping critical mission lines open with CDC recommended guidelines. These actions have allowed us to keep the business up and running to support our customers who are truly on the front lines. Early on in the crisis, we began receiving messages from law enforcement around the globe asking Axon if we will be shipping out TASER 7 and Axon Body 3. From major city police departments to small departments, many of our customers were anxiously awaiting to get their mission critical devices, making sure that our first responders have the tools that they need to keep communities safe was a key factor in our decision to keep mission critical manufacturing lines open. To keep our employ\u2019s health and safety and to do our part to flatten occur, we added a lot of precautions and continued paying employees in high risk groups even though they couldn\u2019t work. We detailed that in our shareholder letter and it compressed our TASER gross margins by 110 basis points. If there were no COVID-19, beyond our phenomenal Q1 results that kicked off a strong start to the year, the secondary headline this quarter would be that Axon Dispatch went live. This is a major milestone for our company and shows Axon\u2019s ability to keep key initiatives going even throughout a global pandemic. We told you last quarter that we would be live by mid-year with our first paying Dispatch customer and we\u2019re thrilled that we launched even a bit sooner. Dispatch is our entry into a $2 billion rapidly growing real-time command and control software market. We\u2019re pretty thrilled to be powering the 911 dispatching operations for the city of Maricopa, which is our first launch partner. This software is also critical to our mission to protect life. It empowers everyone involved in an incident response, dispatchers, call takers, command, patrol officers, firefighters and medical personnel. The goal here is to shorten the time from hello to hello. That\u2019s what the industry calls the time between when somebody first calls 911 to the time an officer arrives. Another key initiative for us is hiring, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the hiring velocity that we\u2019ve seen and we continue to accelerate particularly in this last quarter, as always leaning in rather than holding back. In particular, Chief Product Officer, Jeff Kunins, who\u2019s on the call with us today, has rapidly filled key senior tech leadership roles including our new SVP of AI, VP of Digital Evidence Management, and our GM of Axon Air, and more while doubling down to rapidly grow our engineering bench with far raising talent in our global software hub in Seattle as well as in Vietnam and Scottsdale. I started out with a shout out to the Axon employees, and I want to end my section with another one. This is a great team that has really leaned in during the crisis to support each other as well as our customers. Thank you to all of our dedicated employees. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to our CFO, Jawad Ahsan.\nJawad Ahsan: Thanks, Luke. The world has changed since our last earnings call, and the challenges we face today are unprecedented. As I reflect on our Q1 results and take stock of where we stand today, three words come to mind; pride, resilience, and confidence. We have made no secret of our love for our customers. I\u2019m proud of the way we stepped up to source PPE for first responders in a nationwide campaign in partnership with the National Police Foundation. I\u2019m proud of the way our employees contributed to that campaign. I\u2019m even more proud of the way that our employees adapted to our new reality, continuing to work cohesively and productively, even with the distributed workforce. It\u2019s a testament to the internal tools, systems and support infrastructure we\u2019ve worked hard to put into place. At this stage in our growth, as an enterprise SaaS and connected device company, we have purposefully chosen to be aggressive with our investments and conservative with our balance sheet. This strategy has brought us the resilience that will allow us to weather the storm and emerge stronger than ever. Our investments in both product and channel are yielding exciting returns and our liquidity position is exceptionally strong. We are also seeing three trends emerging that add to our resilience. First, the current crisis is fostering discussions about cloud software usage with agencies that wouldn\u2019t have previously considered it, and we\u2019re demonstrating the value and utility of Axon Citizen to agencies across the globe. Second, we\u2019re seeing more agencies move to Axon devices as standard issue, rather than pooling or sharing devices. And third, we\u2019re seeing the federal government step in to bolster law enforcement budgets and committing stimulus to law and order spending, which may have benefits that outlast the crisis. Our go-to-market model is increasingly resilient, as we sell more products that agencies pay for out of their operating budgets rather than being treated as an unpredictable capital expense. And the majority of our revenue is tied to bundle recurring contracts, 71% in 2019. In our SaaS business, net revenue retention over the past six months has trended at about 120%. This has become an important metric for us in terms of how we look at the business and that is why we\u2019re sharing it today. The metric captures two key factors; first, our annual churn is almost nil as our customers typically sign 5- to 10-year contracts, giving us more resilience and contracting than most other SaaS companies. In second, Axon retention recaptures that in any given year, some portion of our agency customers are upgrading their contracts to take advantage of all of the new software tools we have to offer. Some major cities are committing to SaaS upgrades with Axon at 300% of their prior contracts and that\u2019s a testament again to our resilience, and to the value proposition we offer our customers. Finally, as we look out at the remainder of the year, we are feeling confident. We are withdrawing our guidance today for one reason, the full extent and impact of the current crisis on the markets we serve and on our business simply cannot be known at this time. What we do know is that we are evaluating a wide range of scenarios with respect to the potential ongoing impact of the pandemic and we feel confident in our ability to manage through this crisis. In fact, our internal 2020 goals that we\u2019re managing to remain the same. In recent weeks, our federal and international pipelines have strengthened. We continue to hire bar-raising tech talent at an accelerating pace, and we continue to execute upon a robust pipeline closing large, multimillion dollar, multi-year officer\u2019s safety plan contracts. These are uncertain times, and our customers and employees are being impacted in significant ways. We\u2019re grateful to all of our employees around the world who continue to show incredible commitment to our mission, ingenuity and resolving their execution. While we\u2019re facing unprecedented adversity today, one thing is for sure, our best days are still ahead of us. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Andrea to take us through the questions.\nA - Andrea James: Thanks, Jawad. Moderators, can you bring everybody up onto camera view? Analysts, we want to see your pretty faces. Can you turn on your cameras? Okay. Our first question \u2013 thank you. Our first question is from Scott Berg at Needham.\nRick Smith: Hey, Scott. Go ahead with your questions.\nScott Berg: Hi, thanks. This is a little different for Q&A. Hope everyone is doing well. Apologize, I was a couple of minutes late to the call. So I\u2019ll ask a redundant question I guess. You\u2019ll see it in my face at least. So I guess a couple questions. On the net revenue retention metric that Jawad just gave, at 120%. Good metric. Thank you for disclosing it. Can you help us understand how that compares maybe over the last couple of three years in terms of trending? Has that been around that 120%? Has that been up? Has that been down? That would be helpful.\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. Scott, it\u2019s been around that. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019ve started to disclose it is that it\u2019s stable, it\u2019s been stable enough over the past few quarters that we\u2019ve decided to start disclosing it. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very proud of.\nScott Berg: Got it. And then from a follow-up question perspective, the inventory increase was something in the prescriptive remarks that kind of caught my eye. At least, how high do you think inventory levels go over the next couple of three quarters? I think it\u2019s approved move that you\u2019re doing, obviously, given the uncertainty around some of the global trade components there. But does that reach a really large level? And are you doing it because you\u2019ve seen issues or you just kind of protecting yourself from that opportunity?\nLuke Larson: Hey, Scott, great question. We have a big upgrade cycle ahead of us with TASER 7 as well as AB 3 in addition to expanding in adjacent markets corrections as well as international expansion. And so we went through an exhaustive exercise to say what is the right level of inventory for us to make sure that we can fulfill customer demand, de-risk our supply chain, and also have enough for these expansions. That actually ended up being a great strategy and has helped us in the last few months. We\u2019re going through another analysis now to see what the right levels are throughout year-end. We want to ensure that we\u2019re managing our free cash flow, but also have the right inventory levels to support customer fulfillment.\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. And I want to add, Scott, to that just so how to think about it from a financial perspective. It is going to be something that\u2019s going to be a fairly material use of cash this year. We think it\u2019s the right thing to do for the reasons that Luke mentioned. But that\u2019s one of the advantages that we\u2019ve got with the balance sheet that we have to be able to be in a position to fund that inventory built.\nScott Berg: Great, that\u2019s all I have. I\u2019ll jump back into the queue here. Congrats, again.\nAndrea James: Thanks so much, guys. And we\u2019re going to take our next question from Charlie Anderson at Dougherty.\nCharlie Anderson: Great. Can you guys hear me all right?\nRick Smith: Yes\nCharlie Anderson: Excellent. Well, congrats on a great strong start to the year. I want to do, it sounds like just to characterize things that sounds like you\u2019re not seeing the effects of COVID-19 as of yet on the pipeline, the demand profile. I want to make sure that that\u2019s correct, that you haven\u2019t seen any push outs or cancellations at this point. Just want to sort of characterize what you\u2019re seeing in real time as far as those conversations as cities are evaluating the revenue.\nJosh Isner: Hi, Charlie, that\u2019s a great question. Before I answer, and I\u2019ll come right back to it, I just want to acknowledge Breann Leath who is an officer out of Indianapolis Metro Police Department, and we\u2019ve been very active in supporting the department and her. She passed away in April due to a officer involved shooting and very sad time for one of our longest standing customers, and we just want to acknowledge her and her family. We also want to acknowledge all of the first responders around the world, who didn\u2019t have the luxury of sheltering-in-place or quarantining, and are out on the front lines putting themselves and their families at risk every day. And we\u2019re here to support our customers, and our thoughts and prayers are with them during this time. Now as it pertains to pipeline, and it is accurate to say there have been some minor adjustments to the pipeline. We are hearing on a qualitative basis that some agencies do expect impacts on their budgets. And there\u2019s tax revenues that are in question and so forth, as well as federal support for state and local. On the flip side, we\u2019re also hearing from some customers that COVID is the reason they\u2019re thinking about going to standard issue for our product. So whether it\u2019s body cams or TASER, one way to limit contamination is not sharing equipment and we\u2019re hearing that sentiment as well. And so I think there\u2019s a little on both sides here. So there\u2019s nothing material either way at this point that we view as a major disruption to the pipeline. But we do have respect for the unprecedented risk that exists right now with COVID. And so we\u2019re certainly focused on executing, fulfilling all of our goals this year and continuing to build our long-term pipeline, not only in terms of state and local, but also federal, international and some of our newer channels as well. Thanks very much.\nAndrea James: Charlie, do you have a follow-up? We can unmute, if you have one. Yes.\nCharlie Anderson: Yes. Great, I do. Yes. So thank you for all that color. So, I guess I was also curious to, as it relates to software. So on Records and on Dispatch, I wonder if this presents potentially an opportunity for you guys as it relates to your pricing strategy relative to the incumbents there. So as you sort of consider the pressures that they may be under, I\u2019m sort of curious that that creates any opportunities that you\u2019re seeing. Yes, so thanks.\nJosh Isner: Yes. To some extent, certainly we view this as an opportunity. We continue to invest, we\u2019re investing in the channel and the product, and we are using creative ways to continue to connect with our customers more virtually than ever. I think with or without COVID, we still feel like we are certainly a force to be reckoned with, both on the product side and the channel side in any new product that we\u2019re investing in and bringing to market. And so we\u2019re definitely confident in the long-term that we\u2019re going to be very, very competitive in all of these markets, whether it\u2019s DMS, CAD, RMS and so forth.\nCharlie Anderson: Great. Thanks, guys.\nRick Smith: Yes, I would actually have \u2013 it\u2019s okay, I want to add one thing here. I don\u2019t know that COVID has impacted so much, but I would say my confidence in our strategy and how we approach developing software products is getting stronger by the day and sort of key element of our strategies. We decided not to try to go broad to win the battle of the RFPs with 800 check boxes, but to really build fantastic user-centric software that does the things those officers do every day really, really well. And that allows through our list officers \u2013 safety plan officers to try elements of the system and basically win through a fantastic user experience. And I think long-term that sets us up to have a really strong market position by focusing on the things that ultimately it makes it a great experience for the cops in the field. And that strategy appears to be playing out as every time they\u2019re touching our software, we\u2019re hearing, oh wow! Like this is a great experience and we have procurement plans that allow them to start small and expand with us.\nCharlie Anderson: Thanks.\nAndrea James: Okay. So our next question will come from Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Hi. Can you hear me okay?\nAndrea James: Yes.\nRick Smith: Yes.\nJonathan Ho: Perfect. One of the things I wanted to understand a little bit better is, with the new CAD system that you\u2019re rolling out, can you talk a little bit about maybe the feature set and what segment of the market that you\u2019re potentially targeting? Since there\u2019s pretty much a high-end, mid range and low-end of the market, just want to get a sense of what you guys are looking at with that system.\nJawad Ahsan: Yes, absolutely. Great question. So first, the first thing I say is we\u2019re incredibly excited to be live in the market with our first happy customer in Maricopa and Chief Stahl. And at the end of 2020, just to put it in context, for this first year, our goal is to be GA with a product, that\u2019s a fantastic fit for a significant percentage of U.S. agencies, live and/or active deployments with the next handful of customers beyond Maricopa and we en route to steadily growing SAM coverage with strong sales pipelines match. And so specifically what that means to your question is in the same way that for records in RMS, kind of the unit of currency for building up coverage of which customers for which you are a great fit for what they need, which we\u2019re now well on our journey and continuing to accelerate on. For CAD, the main dimensions are, one, whether a given jurisdiction, the key staff that serves the jurisdiction only serves law enforcement dispatch or also serves fire and EMS. And then the second primary dimension is whether it\u2019s serving a single jurisdiction at a time or if it\u2019s an aggregated piece that serves multiple jurisdictions at once. And so what you\u2019ll see on there, same kind of playbook we\u2019ve been doing with Records is starting with a whole great product for a subset of agencies that fit in one of those, so specifically like single jurisdiction law enforcement only, and then we\u2019ll progressively from there becoming an awesome, excellent excessive tranche for potential customers. So that\u2019s our overall approach. Of course, it\u2019s early days, I\u2019m very confident to Rick\u2019s point that over time Axon will probably be the number one share leader in both Records and Dispatch. And then along the way, we\u2019re going to wind up up-leveling the buying criteria for these categories to be much more about end-to-end agency productivity in the case of records and real-time operations in the case of CAD. So it\u2019s a multi-year journey, no one should have any illusions it\u2019s going to be overnight. But just as Rick said, customers are loving what we\u2019re building, they\u2019re loving the OSP 7 Plus bundling approach and the way that makes things easier to buy and adopt. And those two together are helping us state where the market is going.\nJonathan Ho: Fantastic. And just as a follow-up, with some of the potentially challenging macro environments that are coming up, how do you think about balancing between operating leverage and maybe investing when your competition cannot? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. Jonathan, that\u2019s a great question and that\u2019s something we actually very purposefully went into 2020 with. Our budget for the year, we had disclosed in our previous guidance is that this is a year in which we\u2019re getting very aggressive about making investments in the R&D team and our product team in our sales channel. A lot of the open positions that we have are geared towards those groups as we\u2019re seeking to very aggressively, put the pedal to the metal and try to continue to grow, bring these products to market, continue to expand our footprint. And it\u2019s because of the proof points that we\u2019ve seen in products like Records in some of the international markets that we\u2019ve started to enter is that we\u2019re going to double down on those debts.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nAndrea James: Okay. And do you have a follow-up? Okay, great. Our next question will come from Keith Housum at Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, everybody. Probably this question is for Josh. Josh, the international sales was very good this quarter. I was hoping you could provide a perspective. Is that more widespread across the board or was it targeted with just a few different agencies? And the second, what\u2019s our strength in software and sensors or the weapons business, but some more color there.\nJosh Isner: Yes, sure, and thank you for the question, Keith. So I would characterize it as, look, two or three years ago, we made large investments in our international channel. We were seeing success at that point in Tier 1 markets, but outside of Tier 1 we were having very little success. And as we look at not only the Q1 results, but also the pipeline for the rest of the year, I\u2019m feeling really good that that investment of a couple of years ago is really starting to pay off. And so while Q1 Tier 1 countries were strong in terms of revenue on the CEW side, we also saw some meaningful contributions from Tier 2 and rest of the world, and I expect those to continue throughout 2020, I think especially on the CEW side, we\u2019re starting to see a lot of that work that the team\u2019s been putting in coming to fruition.\nKeith Housum: Great, thanks. And then just as a follow-up. Jawad, maybe if I could go back to a commentary I thought you guys said before, was there a pressure of 110 basis points on gross margins for, I guess, if I heard correctly, paying for employees during the COVID time. And then is that going to continue on into the second quarter?\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. We\u2019re not going to disclose to what degree it\u2019s going to weigh on margins, but it is going to weigh on margins in Q2. This is one of the trickiest things about not issuing guidance. We still are, as I mentioned earlier, managing to our internal estimates, which had formed the basis for our previous guidance. On the flip side, we\u2019re also seeing savings, right. People aren\u2019t traveling as much. There were some programs that we had committed to that we\u2019re not going to be able to do in person now and there\u2019s some cost savings that are associated with that. So while we are going to be impacted to a slightly larger degree in Q2 than what we saw in Q1, we also are going to see savings that are going to offset it.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Keith. We did come \u2013 a question came in from the public, anonymously actually. And we weren\u2019t anticipating that, but it\u2019s a good one, so I thought I would answer it. It says, great earnings call experience, best one yet. Do you plan to continue providing earnings calls on Zoom instead of a traditional webcast? I think our answer to that is design thinking, iterate test and learn. So we\u2019ll come back to you on that one. We\u2019ll see if you guys like it. All right. So our next question will be from Will Power at Baird.\nWill Power: Okay, great. Yes, a couple of questions. Just let me maybe start with a broader question for Rick or Luke or whoever wants to take it. And one of the big themes in software, particularly with respect to COVID-19 and the impacts is that as an accelerant to digital transformation more broadly. I wonder what you\u2019re saying with respect to the conversations you\u2019re having with law enforcement along those lines, as you kind of talk about Records, Dispatch and trying to move to the cloud, it was seem to feed into that. Or is it just they\u2019re so focused on other things that that\u2019s not really entering the dialogue yet?\nRick Smith: Yes. Let me take this one. I mean, there are some really bright silver linings to this, the cloud that is this pandemic. I talked about my customer engagement velocity. I literally, I have never had this many customer meetings and I think their eyes have been open to new ways of interacting. I think that our travel expenses should be more controllable in the future that we should be able to engage with more customers over Zoom. They\u2019re seeing that this is an effective way to engage. I\u2019m also hearing and sensing two other things. One, another bright silver lining here is law enforcement is telling me that this has started to shift perceptions of police again, where a few years ago they were facing a lot of negativity. Now this is almost like a 911 sort of thing where people are realizing, hey, those cops are out there. More cops are being killed this year by the pandemic so far than guns and vehicle accidents combined. And that\u2019s a good thing that it\u2019s rebuilding public support for policing and we\u2019re hopeful that that will flow into the federal government actually stepping in and helping fund first responders. And then the other side of it is, the impetus to do business differently is just strong. I was talking with some customers this past week that want to start pushing the courts to start accepting digital evidence instead of forcing them to burn things to desk, right? We\u2019ve been successful in getting prosecutors to start using evidence.com. The courts have been more resistant to it, where now people are downloading stuff that the prosecutor or the agency to put on disks to deliver to the court. And I\u2019ve been out with some of our customers, hey, let\u2019s find the alpha patient. Let\u2019s find some judges that are going to break down the barrier and say, hey, look, let\u2019s move it online. And one of the things we hear is, well, courts don\u2019t have great like technology systems. That\u2019s music to our ears. They don\u2019t need it. They need a browser. Like they don\u2019t need to install servers and stuff, it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for us to upgrade their experience. And everywhere I look, I see the negatives of COVID are driving change that previously wasn\u2019t possible. And I\u2019ll give you one other example, we with the push for Axon Citizen in Europe. There\u2019s been just a ton of resistance in mainland Europe to using the cloud for a whole bunch of reasons, we\u2019ve talked about on previous conference calls, and we\u2019ve been really pushing the team hard to engage with customers. Look, what could be a stronger reason to move to a cloud-hosted digital evidence sharing platform than social distancing in a world where you want to minimize the risk of your officers out going to pick up CDs and hard drives or thumb drives from the public. I don\u2019t know we have anything material to report back other than what we\u2019re hearing is quite different. Customers that have been traditionally quite resistant to change, they\u2019re changing across the board and we\u2019re looking at how we can help use this to drive positive long-term change, which can include a lot of digital transformation.\nWill Power: Okay. And my second \u2013 go ahead.\nRick Smith: Go ahead, please.\nWill Power: Well, I was going to say, my second question was just a follow up on some of the corrections, commentary. I know you all have been talking about that several calls in a row. I think you\u2019ve referenced right in front of me, maybe five states that you have relationships with now. Where does that stand in terms of shipments? Any other numbers, quantification? How long that takes to really kind of ramp into a bigger opportunity?\nRick Smith: Sure thing. So about a third into last year we\u2019ve ramped up our efforts specifically focusing on corrections. And this year we have an independent sales team focused on that market. And I\u2019m really excited about the work that they\u2019re doing so far. It wasn\u2019t a place where we were necessarily focused in the past, but now the use cases are coming much more \u2013 becoming much more clear. And obviously on the body camera side there are benefits there. And on the TASER side in terms of riot control and so forth. And one of the interesting things is given COVID officers are actually really risking their safety by going hands on in jails because COVID obviously could spread really quickly through a contained environment like that. So we\u2019re seeing more investment on a faster cadence than in the past, particularly in the CEW segment to keep officers from having to go hands on and protect them from a potential risk of infection. So long-term we definitely see corrections becoming a more meaningful part of our domestic business, both on the federal and on the state local level.\nWill Power: Okay. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Thank you, Will. Our next question is from Joe Osha at JMP Securities.\nJoe Osha: Hi there. For starters, my compliments to everybody for doing such a good job with this Zoom conference. This has been great. Thank you to IR team. Two questions. First, I see that the portion of TASERs that was sold in a recurring payment plan went down as a result of the shift international. I\u2019m just wondering whether there might be some potential to think about shifting the way those non-U.S. customers behave over time. And then the second question is a more general one. We\u2019ve had a chain of evidence. We\u2019ve had CAD. We\u2019ve had Records management. I\u2019m just wondering whether this crisis might perhaps cause Axon just sort of resequence how it\u2019s coming at those priorities a little bit. Those are my questions.\nJosh Isner: Okay, Joe, thanks for your question. And I\u2019d be happy to take the first one and then hand it over for the second one. So on international subscriptions, we actually are seeing that already in our Tier 1 market. So in Australia, the UK and Canada, it is relatively common for agencies to sign up for a TASER 60 contract where they pay just like in the U.S. over 60 months. Especially in the UK, every agency in the UK that is a CEW customer is actually already on a TASER 60 plan. So the team has done a really nice job. They\u2019re transitioning to subscription. Australia is moving in that direction as well. And then Canada is lagging behind a little bit just due to the fact that we\u2019ve commonly sold through distribution in Canada and the TASER 7 has not been authorized there yet. And so I would say that ball is moving in the right direction. There is some complication in Tier 2 and 3 markets especially some of the more volatile ones where there might be a little more risk of collectability on multi-year engagements and so forth. So we\u2019re monitoring that very closely to make sure that we\u2019re very confident in the deals we\u2019re signing. But I would say it\u2019s fair to expect international to continue to pivot more to a subscription type of set up on TASER business.\nJoe Osha: Thank you.\nRick Smith: Yes, I\u2019m continuing from there on that second part of the question. Obviously we like to think of Axon as a learning and adapting machine. So we always continue to re-examine the data in front of us and reserve the right to wake up smarter as we learn more. But I think from what we\u2019ve seen so far our transformation has been validating of our focus and prioritization that we have in front of us. Our R&D investment, which is we\u2019ve continued to double down on and be aggressive about investment, looking forward to leverage as we go forward. Really on our core pillars of relation including TASER and sensors and signals, in the like across our categories for [Audio Dip] management and the new investments in the categories, productivity with records and communications and real time operations with CAD. And those are taken up the last fall, in addition to some of these in areas like Axon Air with drones in the lake. We evaluate those pretty regularly and we feel great about the validation we\u2019re seeing like what we\u2019ve been describing with records and CAD and the rest that we\u2019ve got the right to live into the best in each of those and the right sequencing. But we\u2019ll continue to evaluate as we go and make those small and bigger adjustments if and when that makes sense, but we\u2019re feeling pretty good about that prioritization.\nJoe Osha: Okay. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Joe. Our next question is from Erik Lapinski at Morgan Stanley. Erik, your video is off. Give me another second.\nErik Lapinski: Can you hear me and see me. Hello?\nAndrea James: We can hear you. Go ahead and ask the question. We can\u2019t see it, but go ahead and ask.\nErik Lapinski: Sorry. It shows me on mine, but maybe I\u2019ll just kind of ask on dispatch and that first kind of paid customer rollout, from that from initial trials and interest and roll over of systems and finalist limitation like what were some of the learnings you may be had on what the typical sales cycle would look like with a dispatch customer and kind of anything you could share there.\nRick Smith: Sorry, Erik, you were breaking up a little. Do you mind just repeating that question, my apologies.\nErik Lapinski: Yes, no problem. Can you hear me now?\nRick Smith: Yes.\nErik Lapinski: Just quickly on maybe what were some of the learnings you had from just the pace of rollout in the sales cycle. It\u2019s your first paid dispatch customer and kind of, I guess what you could share there.\nRick Smith: Sure thing. Thanks very much for the question. I think just like with all kind of early customers, we\u2019re really focused right now on learning. And so we have a pipeline of customers that we look forward to working with on CAD deployments. But a higher priority for us is gaining some early use cases, references and success stories. And so for the next at least three to five customers, that\u2019s really where our focus lies is making sure we\u2019re ready to scale and we continue to build that interest pipeline. So when that pipeline starts to convert, there are plenty of happy customers that can speak to their success with the product. We anticipate a lot of interest in the product from all segments in the market and we\u2019re seeing it already. And so we\u2019re very, very excited about the potential of our CAD business.\nErik Lapinski: That\u2019s helpful. And then if I could just maybe one follow-up, as you look everything going on in the potential impacts that your customers could see, like are there any actions or promotions you\u2019ve thought through where you could kind of help customers, I guess from a pricing or a pull license perspective or kind of accommodations you consider this year.\nRick Smith: Sure. Nothing really across the market, certainly the customers that, that have voiced challenges whether they\u2019re budget or timing of some of those budgets. We\u2019re working through them on a one \u2013 on kind of a one off basis. But at this point, we don\u2019t plan on having like an overarching program across the market. Frankly, we just haven\u2019t seen that type of concern yet from the customer base. But certainly, we\u2019re going to continue to monitor it and we\u2019re necessary. We\u2019ll make adjustments. But right now we\u2019re still certainly executing as per our normal kind of approach to these deals.\nErik Lapinski: Thank you.\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. And I would just add on that we \u2013 today we have several different ways that a customer can acquire our products from just buying a individual device to multiple plans. Our premium plan, OSP 7 Plus, and the leadership team is very aligned around the benefits of this as are the customers. They can just start using on day one. And so that\u2019s been very positively received.\nAndrea James: Thank you, guys. Erik, and I can see you now, you popped up. So our next question will be from Ryan Sigdahl at Craig-Hallum. Go ahead Ryan.\nRyan Sigdahl: Hey, thanks, Andrea. And to start, I\u2019m going to guess your background is fake.\nAndrea James: You got it. Any others?\nRyan Sigdahl: Oh, I\u2019m going to guess Jeff.\nAndrea James: So Jeff\u2019s background is actually the 14th floor at our Seattle software hub.\nRyan Sigdahl: Okay. Well, I\u2019ll take one out of two for some flag anyways.\nJeff Kunins: Come, visit any time when we\u2019re open.\nRyan Sigdahl: Awesome. For me here first off, just to follow-up on corrections, what percent approximately of the 450,000 correctional officers do you think carry a TASER today, and then separately on the body cams.\nRick Smith: Yes. Qualitatively both of those numbers are low relative to the overall population. But state by state, we\u2019re really making progress quarter in and quarter out to show some really rapid growth in that department. So at this point, I\u2019m not prepared to give a firm numbers on that, but qualitatively there\u2019s a lot of white space in that market and we think for the first time we\u2019re really seeing meaningful momentum there to start to capture some of that white space.\nRyan Sigdahl: Fair to put in a ballpark of 25%, 50%, 75% just or innings if you want to talk baseball.\nJawad Ahsan: I appreciate the sports analogy, but we\u2019re going to stick with the first answer on that one \u2013 well, thanks.\nRyan Sigdahl: Second question just on TASER 7, it declined for the second consecutive quarter seems a bit surprising given the recent launch. So how do you guys think about that product mix within weapons segment over the remainder of the year, Thanks.\nRick Smith: So Ryan, thanks again for the question. I think that\u2019s just seasonality. Q3 and Q4 our strongest quarters of the year. So coming off our two strongest quarters with what historically have been kind of slower starts. So we\u2019re in Q1 and Q2, it\u2019s not a huge surprise to us that TASER 7 sales are not going to be as strong here. And we expect that to definitely change in the back half of the year as we continue to build pipeline and work with large agencies on meaningful T7 deployments.\nAndrea James: Thanks, guys. Mike Latimore from Northland. You\u2019re up next.\nMike Latimore: Yes, thanks. Can you hear me, okay.\nRick Smith: Okay, yes.\nMike Latimore: Sounds good, thanks. I think you said that you have about 50% visibility into the kind of original guidance for the year. I guess, at this point last year, what was that visibility.\nRick Smith: Yes, in any given year, Mike, we typically into the year with about that. I think last year was a little less probably, I think we\u2019re on the mid-40s, I believe. And this year, we have every year as we continue to progress in our SaaS business, it\u2019s been increasing.\nAndrea James: What percentage are Q1 sales make of the full year. It\u2019s a much higher percentage that would be typical, this Q1.\nMike Latimore: Sure, okay. Makes sense. And then I believe, maybe third quarter, fourth quarter you\u2019re going to start recognizing more of the records revenue. As different features get launched, what \u2013 I think there\u2019s a little bit of a catch up event among customers that have already purchased the bundle. So like what kind of ARR bump might you get from it?\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. The first thing is we\u2019re actually not going to get a catch up, the way accounting works is that we\u2019re going to take the same amount of revenue just over a compressed period of time. So it\u2019s going to step up pretty materially over the remainder of those contracts. But there\u2019s not going to be a cumulative catch-up as like another long-term contracts. And right now we had \u2013 what we had said previously and our guidance was that our AR was going to grow $10 million per quarter. We felt that that was conservative this quarter. It grew about $12 million, $12 million to $13 million. And we think it\u2019s going to be, in that $10 million to $15 million range. And as we get towards the end of year, it\u2019s likely going to be at the top end of that range is more of our software products, specifically, records dispatch come online.\nMike Latimore: And then now you touched on this a little bit earlier, but in terms of just international cloud adoption, as you\u2019ve won some of these additional deals internationally. How many are sort of willing to go with Evidence.com in the cloud? Is that trending in the right direction?\nRick Smith: Yes, I\u2019d say it is trending in the right direction. I\u2019d say everything in the international and a huge credit to the team here and the team\u2019s leadership in each region. Things are generally trending in the right direction internationally, across video and CW. Again, these are \u2013 we\u2019re dealing with governments here, not state and local governments like federal government. So these deals do take longer to materialize, but we are seeing more interest in the cloud than we have in the past and more interest in CW\u2019s than we have in the past.\nMike Latimore: Thank you.\nAndrea James: Thank you, guys.\nRick Smith: Andrea, I\u2019d like to reach out and thank Ryan for throwing his hat in the ring to guests on the special backgrounds. And so for any analyst today, who wouldn\u2019t throw their hat in the ring in addition to the tee shirt schwag, if you want to get yourself one of these fancy Axon tattoos, I\u2019ll pay for it personally because we want to encourage you all to get your best Axon schwag on. So Andrea, back to you for some more questions.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Rick. We\u2019re actually to our buy-side investors on the call, who\u2019ve been emailing me. Thanks for guessing. And it sounds like even some of our investors kids are getting in on it. So I just, I love that, like, it\u2019s super cool. So thanks for emailing me to your guests is, I\u2019ll respond after the call. Okay. Next question is from Scott Kessler at Imperial. Scott, go ahead and turn your video on for us.\nScott Kessler: Hey, guys. I am hanging out outside. I unfortunately came in prepared, don\u2019t have any questions, so feel free to jump to the next person there.\nAndrea James: Okay, that\u2019s great. We have a 908 number dialed in and I\u2019m not sure who it is and I\u2019m wondering, if you\u2019d like to ask a question.\nRick Smith: Well, we\u2019re waiting there, Andrea. I can \u2013 I want to take on the elephant in the room that maybe Scott was uncomfortable addressing and that is Josh Isner. Can you share with folks what\u2019s going on with that epic beard? You\u2019ve got going on, I\u2019m sure focusing you for the first time with that big, may want to know.\nJosh Isner: Thanks, Rick for pointing that out. I really appreciate it. So yes, I made a commitment in early March that I would not shave or cut my hair until the office in Scottsdale reopen. At that time, it looked like a late April, early May start. Here we are on May 7 and it\u2019s been extended to June 1. And I am in a world of hurt right now and my wife is even in a bigger world of hurt looking at me every day. So thanks Rick. I appreciate it. And hopefully the next time I see everybody, it\u2019ll be a slightly different look.\nAndrea James: All right. So if any of our analysts have follow-ups, go ahead and let us know via the chat window. We have a few more minutes here. We did get some questions from the public. We hadn\u2019t planned on taking them, but I\u2019ll just read off a couple and we\u2019ll answer them if we have time. One is, is there a next generation of TASER 7 in development and if yes, what would be some of its enhanced features? Rick, I think you should take that one.\nRick Smith: Yes. We typically don\u2019t talk about new features until they\u2019re launched. I would say we are continually evaluating some of the programmatic aspects of TASER 7 to make sure that, we\u2019ve got ways that it can fit all of our different buyer personas. And kind of stay tuned as always for new product developments with Axon.\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. I actually, I want to piggyback on this because I know Rick is trying to do his best to not disclose too much, but one of the reasons I joined the company was to help Rick make the bullet, obviously. And the technology that we\u2019re working on now with the next generation TASER is going to be a big step in that direction. We laid out our goals towards the end of the decade. What we wanted to have accomplished in one of those is to have the TASER be the primary means for an officer to stop the threat. And I think that with what Rick and the TASER team have in mind and what they\u2019re working on, it\u2019s going to be a long way towards that.\nAndrea James: Okay. There\u2019s the next one is just an interesting question. Axon sells TASER self defense devices into the consumer market. Are there any plans to enter the consumer dash cam or body camera market?\nRick Smith: Yes, let me take that one. The answer is, no. The consumer dash cam market is much more of a commodity market and the elements that make our system valuable for professional law enforcement users would not be particularly applicable in that market. So, no.\nAndrea James: Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all we have time for from the public. Thanks for submitting your questions. I\u2019m going to turn the call back over to Rick to close us out.\nRick Smith: Awesome. Well, Hey, thanks. I\u2019m really enjoying the positive feedback on the new format. It\u2019s been enjoyable for me to, I feel a little more connected and seeing your faces and interacting online. Sorry for harassing a little bit there, Josh. It\u2019s just feels like this is a more human experience and I sure, we\u2019re going to evaluate and see if we keep doing it in Zoom. I certainly found this to be much more engaging. I hope you did too. I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us. As you know, Axon does not shy away from challenges. We viewed them as opportunities and we\u2019re trying new approaches and evangelizing our cloud software to public safety and increasing our productivity. And we\u2019re going to continue to lean in to everything that 2020 has got to throw out us. So we hope you all stay safe, healthy and sane during this period of disruption. And we look forward to updating you all again in August. So thanks. And we\u2019ll talk to you soon.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "Awesome. Thanks, Andrea, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We last spoke to you on our Q4 update call on February 27, and what now feels like a very different world, where people ate in restaurants and flew to business meetings and vacations. Three days later we curbed all non-essential travel for our employees, but our message to our team was very clear that we may curb travel or work from home; it does not mean that we are reducing the vigor with which we pursue our mission. Far from it, we are aggressively adapting to new conditions in the world as we Zoom into all our meetings and we will seek opportunities to use this changing environment to leverage our superior adaptability to gain ground against less agile competitors. In the past weeks, Axon has brought forth some major initiatives to address this crisis, including giving free global access to Axon Citizen for the remainder of 2020, and using our supply chain to source PPE for first responders in a nationwide campaign and partnership with the National Police Foundation, which even got the attention of Vice President, Pence, who tweeted about it. A large number of Axon employees donated money or personal time to this cause. Our first responders still face significant risks and we are continuing to match donations for PPE. If you, our investors, are able to support the cause, please do. Help us protect those who keep us safe. Go to axon.com/covid and scroll down and hit the Donate Now button. Even though I've been working from home and getting a lot more time with my kids, including some pedicures for my daughter, Fortnite lessons from my son and helping film product demos with my teenager, I personally have had more face time with customers over Zoom than I've ever had, even in person. I've been doing about five different Zoom customer meetings a day, and that's far higher than was possible when we had to travel in person meetings. So my personal customer engagement velocity is way up. And Jawad and I will be attending more investor conferences this quarter than at any time in the past years as we can now Zoom into those as well. We're proud to be thought leaders on driving technology adoption, and I'm pleased to see how well our customers have adapted to using this technology to be increasingly productive. I was on three customer meetings earlier today and most of them had never used video conferencing before the COVID crisis and now it's become standard. Here's what I'm learning from those customers and what they're telling me. They're working with reduced staff due to personnel being and safety. Customers are seeing this crisis. It's forcing them to adapt and change more rapidly than ever and technology will play an even larger role as a cornerstone in every new business process needed in the world post-COVID. Whether it's using Axon Citizen to gather evidence from the public or our prosecutor portal for sharing digital evidence with prosecutors and courts, the world is changing and Axon thrives on change. We're even helping some key industry thought leadership group replaced their canceled conferences and move them online. Luckily we have a bit of a reputation for being both innovative and pretty good at throwing great events, so we're loading our expertise to industry partners to help them thrive in this new world with us. Now let's talk about the future. Our best estimates for the year remain unchanged and our pipeline remains strong. However, customers are relating to us that they're facing large budget shortfalls and uncertainty in the macro environment unlike anything any of us who've ever seen. Currently our sales pipeline remains solid, but we cannot see over the horizon any better than the rest of you to know how the economy will shake out or if the federal government will step in to provide additional aid to state and local governments. Giving guidance implies a level of certainty that is simply not possible to ascertain right now. To be blunt, in an environment where we see so many companies acknowledging the uncertainties ahead by pulling formal guidance, we believe it would be most prudent to recharacterize our best estimates to acknowledge the higher than normal uncertainty. Hence, we're telling shareholders that even though our business has been very resilient today and our best estimates have not changed, the level of uncertainty has increased to a level where we are no longer comfortable characterizing those estimates as guidance until the macro environment stabilizes. We don't want to imply that we know something the rest of the world doesn't, namely how the economy will unfold in the coming months. We do have Chief Revenue Officer, Josh Isner on the line, and during the Q&A he can speak to the strength of our pipeline if you're interested. All that said, I couldn't be more bullish on Axon. We are change agents. Our adaptability and innovation centric approaches are unique advantages for us when the world changes rapidly as this is happening right now. This isn't the first time Axon has faced adversity. Myself, our President, our Chief Revenue Officer, we're all together managing through the last recession from which we emerged far stronger. In 2008, as the financial crisis ripped the world, we decided to lean in and transform our entire business from being a simple TASER device manufacturing business into an integrated tech company making wearables and cloud software. That transition was anything than easy and we've had many difficult learning curves to overcome. But as competitors in the public safety space retreated, that's exactly when we advanced into new opportunities and we established ourselves as the clear market leader in cloud hosted digital evidence management software and camera sensors. In the past year, we've now shipped two major software products, Axon Records, which is now live or signed with in-flight deployments at more than a dozen agencies; and Axon Dispatch, we just went live at our first customer. Today Axon is stronger than ever. We ended Q1 with nearly $400 million in cash and equivalents, zero debt and an underlying business that generates strong cash flow and high margin recurring revenues. Our Q1 revenue grew 27% year-over-year. And while net income was affected by stock-based compensation expense, our adjusted EBITDA more than doubled year-over-year to $30 million, reflecting a 20% margin. We have several moonshots in progress. Before this decade is out, we will launch a TASER weapon that will outperform a 9 millimeter pistol's stopping power. We will continue to make policing transparent and effective. And we will extend our reach across the criminal justice system, making it both more fair and more efficient. We will continue to create great social value or society and great value for you, our shareholders. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Luke Larson. Luke? Hey, Scott. Go ahead with your questions. Yes Yes, I would actually have \u2013 it's okay, I want to add one thing here. I don't know that COVID has impacted so much, but I would say my confidence in our strategy and how we approach developing software products is getting stronger by the day and sort of key element of our strategies. We decided not to try to go broad to win the battle of the RFPs with 800 check boxes, but to really build fantastic user-centric software that does the things those officers do every day really, really well. And that allows through our list officers \u2013 safety plan officers to try elements of the system and basically win through a fantastic user experience. And I think long-term that sets us up to have a really strong market position by focusing on the things that ultimately it makes it a great experience for the cops in the field. And that strategy appears to be playing out as every time they're touching our software, we're hearing, oh wow! Like this is a great experience and we have procurement plans that allow them to start small and expand with us. Yes. Yes. Let me take this one. I mean, there are some really bright silver linings to this, the cloud that is this pandemic. I talked about my customer engagement velocity. I literally, I have never had this many customer meetings and I think their eyes have been open to new ways of interacting. I think that our travel expenses should be more controllable in the future that we should be able to engage with more customers over Zoom. They're seeing that this is an effective way to engage. I'm also hearing and sensing two other things. One, another bright silver lining here is law enforcement is telling me that this has started to shift perceptions of police again, where a few years ago they were facing a lot of negativity. Now this is almost like a 911 sort of thing where people are realizing, hey, those cops are out there. More cops are being killed this year by the pandemic so far than guns and vehicle accidents combined. And that's a good thing that it's rebuilding public support for policing and we're hopeful that that will flow into the federal government actually stepping in and helping fund first responders. And then the other side of it is, the impetus to do business differently is just strong. I was talking with some customers this past week that want to start pushing the courts to start accepting digital evidence instead of forcing them to burn things to desk, right? We've been successful in getting prosecutors to start using evidence.com. The courts have been more resistant to it, where now people are downloading stuff that the prosecutor or the agency to put on disks to deliver to the court. And I've been out with some of our customers, hey, let's find the alpha patient. Let's find some judges that are going to break down the barrier and say, hey, look, let's move it online. And one of the things we hear is, well, courts don't have great like technology systems. That's music to our ears. They don't need it. They need a browser. Like they don't need to install servers and stuff, it's a fantastic opportunity for us to upgrade their experience. And everywhere I look, I see the negatives of COVID are driving change that previously wasn't possible. And I'll give you one other example, we with the push for Axon Citizen in Europe. There's been just a ton of resistance in mainland Europe to using the cloud for a whole bunch of reasons, we've talked about on previous conference calls, and we've been really pushing the team hard to engage with customers. Look, what could be a stronger reason to move to a cloud-hosted digital evidence sharing platform than social distancing in a world where you want to minimize the risk of your officers out going to pick up CDs and hard drives or thumb drives from the public. I don't know we have anything material to report back other than what we're hearing is quite different. Customers that have been traditionally quite resistant to change, they're changing across the board and we're looking at how we can help use this to drive positive long-term change, which can include a lot of digital transformation. Go ahead, please. Sure thing. So about a third into last year we've ramped up our efforts specifically focusing on corrections. And this year we have an independent sales team focused on that market. And I'm really excited about the work that they're doing so far. It wasn't a place where we were necessarily focused in the past, but now the use cases are coming much more \u2013 becoming much more clear. And obviously on the body camera side there are benefits there. And on the TASER side in terms of riot control and so forth. And one of the interesting things is given COVID officers are actually really risking their safety by going hands on in jails because COVID obviously could spread really quickly through a contained environment like that. So we're seeing more investment on a faster cadence than in the past, particularly in the CEW segment to keep officers from having to go hands on and protect them from a potential risk of infection. So long-term we definitely see corrections becoming a more meaningful part of our domestic business, both on the federal and on the state local level. Yes, I'm continuing from there on that second part of the question. Obviously we like to think of Axon as a learning and adapting machine. So we always continue to re-examine the data in front of us and reserve the right to wake up smarter as we learn more. But I think from what we've seen so far our transformation has been validating of our focus and prioritization that we have in front of us. Our R&D investment, which is we've continued to double down on and be aggressive about investment, looking forward to leverage as we go forward. Really on our core pillars of relation including TASER and sensors and signals, in the like across our categories for [Audio Dip] management and the new investments in the categories, productivity with records and communications and real time operations with CAD. And those are taken up the last fall, in addition to some of these in areas like Axon Air with drones in the lake. We evaluate those pretty regularly and we feel great about the validation we're seeing like what we've been describing with records and CAD and the rest that we've got the right to live into the best in each of those and the right sequencing. But we'll continue to evaluate as we go and make those small and bigger adjustments if and when that makes sense, but we're feeling pretty good about that prioritization. Sorry, Erik, you were breaking up a little. Do you mind just repeating that question, my apologies. Yes. Sure thing. Thanks very much for the question. I think just like with all kind of early customers, we're really focused right now on learning. And so we have a pipeline of customers that we look forward to working with on CAD deployments. But a higher priority for us is gaining some early use cases, references and success stories. And so for the next at least three to five customers, that's really where our focus lies is making sure we're ready to scale and we continue to build that interest pipeline. So when that pipeline starts to convert, there are plenty of happy customers that can speak to their success with the product. We anticipate a lot of interest in the product from all segments in the market and we're seeing it already. And so we're very, very excited about the potential of our CAD business. Sure. Nothing really across the market, certainly the customers that, that have voiced challenges whether they're budget or timing of some of those budgets. We're working through them on a one \u2013 on kind of a one off basis. But at this point, we don't plan on having like an overarching program across the market. Frankly, we just haven't seen that type of concern yet from the customer base. But certainly, we're going to continue to monitor it and we're necessary. We'll make adjustments. But right now we're still certainly executing as per our normal kind of approach to these deals. Yes. Qualitatively both of those numbers are low relative to the overall population. But state by state, we're really making progress quarter in and quarter out to show some really rapid growth in that department. So at this point, I'm not prepared to give a firm numbers on that, but qualitatively there's a lot of white space in that market and we think for the first time we're really seeing meaningful momentum there to start to capture some of that white space. So Ryan, thanks again for the question. I think that's just seasonality. Q3 and Q4 our strongest quarters of the year. So coming off our two strongest quarters with what historically have been kind of slower starts. So we're in Q1 and Q2, it's not a huge surprise to us that TASER 7 sales are not going to be as strong here. And we expect that to definitely change in the back half of the year as we continue to build pipeline and work with large agencies on meaningful T7 deployments. Okay, yes. Yes, in any given year, Mike, we typically into the year with about that. I think last year was a little less probably, I think we're on the mid-40s, I believe. And this year, we have every year as we continue to progress in our SaaS business, it's been increasing. Yes, I'd say it is trending in the right direction. I'd say everything in the international and a huge credit to the team here and the team's leadership in each region. Things are generally trending in the right direction internationally, across video and CW. Again, these are \u2013 we're dealing with governments here, not state and local governments like federal government. So these deals do take longer to materialize, but we are seeing more interest in the cloud than we have in the past and more interest in CW's than we have in the past. Andrea, I'd like to reach out and thank Ryan for throwing his hat in the ring to guests on the special backgrounds. And so for any analyst today, who wouldn't throw their hat in the ring in addition to the tee shirt schwag, if you want to get yourself one of these fancy Axon tattoos, I'll pay for it personally because we want to encourage you all to get your best Axon schwag on. So Andrea, back to you for some more questions. Well, we're waiting there, Andrea. I can \u2013 I want to take on the elephant in the room that maybe Scott was uncomfortable addressing and that is Josh Isner. Can you share with folks what's going on with that epic beard? You've got going on, I'm sure focusing you for the first time with that big, may want to know. Yes. We typically don't talk about new features until they're launched. I would say we are continually evaluating some of the programmatic aspects of TASER 7 to make sure that, we've got ways that it can fit all of our different buyer personas. And kind of stay tuned as always for new product developments with Axon. Yes, let me take that one. The answer is, no. The consumer dash cam market is much more of a commodity market and the elements that make our system valuable for professional law enforcement users would not be particularly applicable in that market. So, no. Awesome. Well, Hey, thanks. I'm really enjoying the positive feedback on the new format. It's been enjoyable for me to, I feel a little more connected and seeing your faces and interacting online. Sorry for harassing a little bit there, Josh. It's just feels like this is a more human experience and I sure, we're going to evaluate and see if we keep doing it in Zoom. I certainly found this to be much more engaging. I hope you did too. I'd like to thank you all for joining us. As you know, Axon does not shy away from challenges. We viewed them as opportunities and we're trying new approaches and evangelizing our cloud software to public safety and increasing our productivity. And we're going to continue to lean in to everything that 2020 has got to throw out us. So we hope you all stay safe, healthy and sane during this period of disruption. And we look forward to updating you all again in August. So thanks. And we'll talk to you soon."

            "content": "Hi, Charlie, that's a great question. Before I answer, and I'll come right back to it, I just want to acknowledge Breann Leath who is an officer out of Indianapolis Metro Police Department, and we've been very active in supporting the department and her. She passed away in April due to a officer involved shooting and very sad time for one of our longest standing customers, and we just want to acknowledge her and her family. We also want to acknowledge all of the first responders around the world, who didn't have the luxury of sheltering-in-place or quarantining, and are out on the front lines putting themselves and their families at risk every day. And we're here to support our customers, and our thoughts and prayers are with them during this time. Now as it pertains to pipeline, and it is accurate to say there have been some minor adjustments to the pipeline. We are hearing on a qualitative basis that some agencies do expect impacts on their budgets. And there's tax revenues that are in question and so forth, as well as federal support for state and local. On the flip side, we're also hearing from some customers that COVID is the reason they're thinking about going to standard issue for our product. So whether it's body cams or TASER, one way to limit contamination is not sharing equipment and we're hearing that sentiment as well. And so I think there's a little on both sides here. So there's nothing material either way at this point that we view as a major disruption to the pipeline. But we do have respect for the unprecedented risk that exists right now with COVID. And so we're certainly focused on executing, fulfilling all of our goals this year and continuing to build our long-term pipeline, not only in terms of state and local, but also federal, international and some of our newer channels as well. Thanks very much. Yes. To some extent, certainly we view this as an opportunity. We continue to invest, we're investing in the channel and the product, and we are using creative ways to continue to connect with our customers more virtually than ever. I think with or without COVID, we still feel like we are certainly a force to be reckoned with, both on the product side and the channel side in any new product that we're investing in and bringing to market. And so we're definitely confident in the long-term that we're going to be very, very competitive in all of these markets, whether it's DMS, CAD, RMS and so forth. Yes, sure, and thank you for the question, Keith. So I would characterize it as, look, two or three years ago, we made large investments in our international channel. We were seeing success at that point in Tier 1 markets, but outside of Tier 1 we were having very little success. And as we look at not only the Q1 results, but also the pipeline for the rest of the year, I'm feeling really good that that investment of a couple of years ago is really starting to pay off. And so while Q1 Tier 1 countries were strong in terms of revenue on the CEW side, we also saw some meaningful contributions from Tier 2 and rest of the world, and I expect those to continue throughout 2020, I think especially on the CEW side, we're starting to see a lot of that work that the team's been putting in coming to fruition. Okay, Joe, thanks for your question. And I'd be happy to take the first one and then hand it over for the second one. So on international subscriptions, we actually are seeing that already in our Tier 1 market. So in Australia, the UK and Canada, it is relatively common for agencies to sign up for a TASER 60 contract where they pay just like in the U.S. over 60 months. Especially in the UK, every agency in the UK that is a CEW customer is actually already on a TASER 60 plan. So the team has done a really nice job. They're transitioning to subscription. Australia is moving in that direction as well. And then Canada is lagging behind a little bit just due to the fact that we've commonly sold through distribution in Canada and the TASER 7 has not been authorized there yet. And so I would say that ball is moving in the right direction. There is some complication in Tier 2 and 3 markets especially some of the more volatile ones where there might be a little more risk of collectability on multi-year engagements and so forth. So we're monitoring that very closely to make sure that we're very confident in the deals we're signing. But I would say it's fair to expect international to continue to pivot more to a subscription type of set up on TASER business. Thanks, Rick for pointing that out. I really appreciate it. So yes, I made a commitment in early March that I would not shave or cut my hair until the office in Scottsdale reopen. At that time, it looked like a late April, early May start. Here we are on May 7 and it's been extended to June 1. And I am in a world of hurt right now and my wife is even in a bigger world of hurt looking at me every day. So thanks Rick. I appreciate it. And hopefully the next time I see everybody, it'll be a slightly different look."

            "content": "Thanks, Rick. Since COVID as a leadership team, we've been laser-focused on three key priorities; number one, the health and safety of our employees; number two, doing our part to help flatten the curve; and number three, keeping key initiatives going to support our customers. I want to give a shout out to all of Axon's employees. They've really stepped up the last two months. I want to give a specific shout out to Josh Goldman, our VP of Ops; Elizabeth Hart, who heads up our people team; and our entire IT team, for their ability to shift our entire workforce to work from home for all of our knowledge workers as well as keeping critical mission lines open with CDC recommended guidelines. These actions have allowed us to keep the business up and running to support our customers who are truly on the front lines. Early on in the crisis, we began receiving messages from law enforcement around the globe asking Axon if we will be shipping out TASER 7 and Axon Body 3. From major city police departments to small departments, many of our customers were anxiously awaiting to get their mission critical devices, making sure that our first responders have the tools that they need to keep communities safe was a key factor in our decision to keep mission critical manufacturing lines open. To keep our employ's health and safety and to do our part to flatten occur, we added a lot of precautions and continued paying employees in high risk groups even though they couldn't work. We detailed that in our shareholder letter and it compressed our TASER gross margins by 110 basis points. If there were no COVID-19, beyond our phenomenal Q1 results that kicked off a strong start to the year, the secondary headline this quarter would be that Axon Dispatch went live. This is a major milestone for our company and shows Axon's ability to keep key initiatives going even throughout a global pandemic. We told you last quarter that we would be live by mid-year with our first paying Dispatch customer and we're thrilled that we launched even a bit sooner. Dispatch is our entry into a $2 billion rapidly growing real-time command and control software market. We're pretty thrilled to be powering the 911 dispatching operations for the city of Maricopa, which is our first launch partner. This software is also critical to our mission to protect life. It empowers everyone involved in an incident response, dispatchers, call takers, command, patrol officers, firefighters and medical personnel. The goal here is to shorten the time from hello to hello. That's what the industry calls the time between when somebody first calls 911 to the time an officer arrives. Another key initiative for us is hiring, and I couldn't be prouder of the hiring velocity that we've seen and we continue to accelerate particularly in this last quarter, as always leaning in rather than holding back. In particular, Chief Product Officer, Jeff Kunins, who's on the call with us today, has rapidly filled key senior tech leadership roles including our new SVP of AI, VP of Digital Evidence Management, and our GM of Axon Air, and more while doubling down to rapidly grow our engineering bench with far raising talent in our global software hub in Seattle as well as in Vietnam and Scottsdale. I started out with a shout out to the Axon employees, and I want to end my section with another one. This is a great team that has really leaned in during the crisis to support each other as well as our customers. Thank you to all of our dedicated employees. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Jawad Ahsan. Hey, Scott, great question. We have a big upgrade cycle ahead of us with TASER 7 as well as AB 3 in addition to expanding in adjacent markets corrections as well as international expansion. And so we went through an exhaustive exercise to say what is the right level of inventory for us to make sure that we can fulfill customer demand, de-risk our supply chain, and also have enough for these expansions. That actually ended up being a great strategy and has helped us in the last few months. We're going through another analysis now to see what the right levels are throughout year-end. We want to ensure that we're managing our free cash flow, but also have the right inventory levels to support customer fulfillment."

            "content": "Thanks, Luke. The world has changed since our last earnings call, and the challenges we face today are unprecedented. As I reflect on our Q1 results and take stock of where we stand today, three words come to mind; pride, resilience, and confidence. We have made no secret of our love for our customers. I'm proud of the way we stepped up to source PPE for first responders in a nationwide campaign in partnership with the National Police Foundation. I'm proud of the way our employees contributed to that campaign. I'm even more proud of the way that our employees adapted to our new reality, continuing to work cohesively and productively, even with the distributed workforce. It's a testament to the internal tools, systems and support infrastructure we've worked hard to put into place. At this stage in our growth, as an enterprise SaaS and connected device company, we have purposefully chosen to be aggressive with our investments and conservative with our balance sheet. This strategy has brought us the resilience that will allow us to weather the storm and emerge stronger than ever. Our investments in both product and channel are yielding exciting returns and our liquidity position is exceptionally strong. We are also seeing three trends emerging that add to our resilience. First, the current crisis is fostering discussions about cloud software usage with agencies that wouldn't have previously considered it, and we're demonstrating the value and utility of Axon Citizen to agencies across the globe. Second, we're seeing more agencies move to Axon devices as standard issue, rather than pooling or sharing devices. And third, we're seeing the federal government step in to bolster law enforcement budgets and committing stimulus to law and order spending, which may have benefits that outlast the crisis. Our go-to-market model is increasingly resilient, as we sell more products that agencies pay for out of their operating budgets rather than being treated as an unpredictable capital expense. And the majority of our revenue is tied to bundle recurring contracts, 71% in 2019. In our SaaS business, net revenue retention over the past six months has trended at about 120%. This has become an important metric for us in terms of how we look at the business and that is why we're sharing it today. The metric captures two key factors; first, our annual churn is almost nil as our customers typically sign 5- to 10-year contracts, giving us more resilience and contracting than most other SaaS companies. In second, Axon retention recaptures that in any given year, some portion of our agency customers are upgrading their contracts to take advantage of all of the new software tools we have to offer. Some major cities are committing to SaaS upgrades with Axon at 300% of their prior contracts and that's a testament again to our resilience, and to the value proposition we offer our customers. Finally, as we look out at the remainder of the year, we are feeling confident. We are withdrawing our guidance today for one reason, the full extent and impact of the current crisis on the markets we serve and on our business simply cannot be known at this time. What we do know is that we are evaluating a wide range of scenarios with respect to the potential ongoing impact of the pandemic and we feel confident in our ability to manage through this crisis. In fact, our internal 2020 goals that we're managing to remain the same. In recent weeks, our federal and international pipelines have strengthened. We continue to hire bar-raising tech talent at an accelerating pace, and we continue to execute upon a robust pipeline closing large, multimillion dollar, multi-year officer's safety plan contracts. These are uncertain times, and our customers and employees are being impacted in significant ways. We're grateful to all of our employees around the world who continue to show incredible commitment to our mission, ingenuity and resolving their execution. While we're facing unprecedented adversity today, one thing is for sure, our best days are still ahead of us. With that, I'll turn it over to Andrea to take us through the questions. Yes. Scott, it's been around that. It's one of the reasons that we've started to disclose it is that it's stable, it's been stable enough over the past few quarters that we've decided to start disclosing it. It's something that we're very proud of. Yes. And I want to add, Scott, to that just so how to think about it from a financial perspective. It is going to be something that's going to be a fairly material use of cash this year. We think it's the right thing to do for the reasons that Luke mentioned. But that's one of the advantages that we've got with the balance sheet that we have to be able to be in a position to fund that inventory built. Yes, absolutely. Great question. So first, the first thing I say is we're incredibly excited to be live in the market with our first happy customer in Maricopa and Chief Stahl. And at the end of 2020, just to put it in context, for this first year, our goal is to be GA with a product, that's a fantastic fit for a significant percentage of U.S. agencies, live and/or active deployments with the next handful of customers beyond Maricopa and we en route to steadily growing SAM coverage with strong sales pipelines match. And so specifically what that means to your question is in the same way that for records in RMS, kind of the unit of currency for building up coverage of which customers for which you are a great fit for what they need, which we're now well on our journey and continuing to accelerate on. For CAD, the main dimensions are, one, whether a given jurisdiction, the key staff that serves the jurisdiction only serves law enforcement dispatch or also serves fire and EMS. And then the second primary dimension is whether it's serving a single jurisdiction at a time or if it's an aggregated piece that serves multiple jurisdictions at once. And so what you'll see on there, same kind of playbook we've been doing with Records is starting with a whole great product for a subset of agencies that fit in one of those, so specifically like single jurisdiction law enforcement only, and then we'll progressively from there becoming an awesome, excellent excessive tranche for potential customers. So that's our overall approach. Of course, it's early days, I'm very confident to Rick's point that over time Axon will probably be the number one share leader in both Records and Dispatch. And then along the way, we're going to wind up up-leveling the buying criteria for these categories to be much more about end-to-end agency productivity in the case of records and real-time operations in the case of CAD. So it's a multi-year journey, no one should have any illusions it's going to be overnight. But just as Rick said, customers are loving what we're building, they're loving the OSP 7 Plus bundling approach and the way that makes things easier to buy and adopt. And those two together are helping us state where the market is going. Yes. Jonathan, that's a great question and that's something we actually very purposefully went into 2020 with. Our budget for the year, we had disclosed in our previous guidance is that this is a year in which we're getting very aggressive about making investments in the R&D team and our product team in our sales channel. A lot of the open positions that we have are geared towards those groups as we're seeking to very aggressively, put the pedal to the metal and try to continue to grow, bring these products to market, continue to expand our footprint. And it's because of the proof points that we've seen in products like Records in some of the international markets that we've started to enter is that we're going to double down on those debts. Yes. We're not going to disclose to what degree it's going to weigh on margins, but it is going to weigh on margins in Q2. This is one of the trickiest things about not issuing guidance. We still are, as I mentioned earlier, managing to our internal estimates, which had formed the basis for our previous guidance. On the flip side, we're also seeing savings, right. People aren't traveling as much. There were some programs that we had committed to that we're not going to be able to do in person now and there's some cost savings that are associated with that. So while we are going to be impacted to a slightly larger degree in Q2 than what we saw in Q1, we also are going to see savings that are going to offset it. Yes. And I would just add on that we \u2013 today we have several different ways that a customer can acquire our products from just buying a individual device to multiple plans. Our premium plan, OSP 7 Plus, and the leadership team is very aligned around the benefits of this as are the customers. They can just start using on day one. And so that's been very positively received. I appreciate the sports analogy, but we're going to stick with the first answer on that one \u2013 well, thanks. Yes. The first thing is we're actually not going to get a catch up, the way accounting works is that we're going to take the same amount of revenue just over a compressed period of time. So it's going to step up pretty materially over the remainder of those contracts. But there's not going to be a cumulative catch-up as like another long-term contracts. And right now we had \u2013 what we had said previously and our guidance was that our AR was going to grow $10 million per quarter. We felt that that was conservative this quarter. It grew about $12 million, $12 million to $13 million. And we think it's going to be, in that $10 million to $15 million range. And as we get towards the end of year, it's likely going to be at the top end of that range is more of our software products, specifically, records dispatch come online. Yes. I actually, I want to piggyback on this because I know Rick is trying to do his best to not disclose too much, but one of the reasons I joined the company was to help Rick make the bullet, obviously. And the technology that we're working on now with the next generation TASER is going to be a big step in that direction. We laid out our goals towards the end of the decade. What we wanted to have accomplished in one of those is to have the TASER be the primary means for an officer to stop the threat. And I think that with what Rick and the TASER team have in mind and what they're working on, it's going to be a long way towards that."

Welcome to Axon\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. We appreciate you are tuning in today in the midst of considerable market volatility and global -- geopolitical risk. Today we have available Axon CEO, Rick Smith; President, Luke Larson; CFO, Jawad Ahsan; Chief Revenue Officer, Josh Isner; and Chief Product Officer, Jeff Kunins. I hope you\u2019ve all had a chance to read our Shareholder Letter, which was released after the market closed. You can find it at investor.axon.com. Our remarks today are meant to build upon the information in that robust letter. During this call, we discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made today are pursuant to and within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today and they are not guarantees of future performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are discussed in our SEC filings. Okay, so before we go to Rick, we are going to play our quarterly update video. This video was pre-recorded before current global events escalated. But we\u2019re making the decision to share it today because there\u2019s important information about our quarterly update in the video. Okay. Thank you. [Video Presentation] Thank you, Operator. Go ahead.\nRick Smith: All right. Thank you, Andrea. I was just waiting for the queue here. I love waiting -- watching those videos. We\u2019ve got the most creative finance team in the business. And as you can see from that video, we\u2019ve been looking forward to sharing results from the best year in Axon\u2019s history. But we\u2019re heavy hearted to do this on a day when democracy is under attack and wars breaking out in Europe. But we don\u2019t get to choose whether the times we live in will include geopolitical instability or global pandemics. What we can choose are our principles and how we respond. We stand for transparency, truth and protecting life. Our products are designed to strengthen trust in the rule of law and they support the United Nations 16th Sustainable Development Goal to foster peace, justice and strong institutions. My thought are especially with the U.K., Ukraine national police who are our customer, as well as our excellent teammates in Ukraine. As we kick off 2022, I\u2019m confident Axon\u2019s best days are ahead of us. We are prioritizing our people and giving them a platform to further excel at what they do. Last month, Dr. Richard Carmona announced he will be retiring from Axon\u2019s Board after 15 years of service. Dr. Carmona has been a tremendous contributor to Axon, helping us shape strategy and positioning Axon as we evolved from a single product company known as TASER to where we are today. He is simply a wonderful human being. We\u2019re incredibly grateful to him not only for his 15 years of service, but also for the way forward he helped us to define. As I reflect on what is driving our strength, it is a powerful combination of solving real challenges for our customers, creating a better user experience and attracting passionate talent. It\u2019s really our emphasis on building software at the core that creates a great user experience. Historically, our competitors built software to fit RFPs, which check a lot of boxes, but ultimately, does not function well in the hands of user. We\u2019ve been religious about understanding our customer\u2019s needs and building software and products that delight them when they use them. When customers test Axon solutions, we stand apart. As we consider the competitive landscape. One of the most important factors that sets us apart is that we truly have a highly integrated suite, a high performance ecosystem that seamlessly connects hardware, software and our community of users to achieve our mission of delivering a safer world. When competitors talk about winning market share, it\u2019s mostly focused on lower margin hardware buyers who don\u2019t get value great software and usually aren\u2019t ready to advance to the cloud. We look forward to welcoming those customers down the road, just like the many agencies here in the U.S. that are upgrading from continuing platforms to the Axon ecosystem. Perhaps even more important than the technology we\u2019ve built is the mission mindset of our employees that sets us apart. I regularly hear from chiefs raving about their positive experience with our employees, because they are so passionate about helping our customers succeed. I recently got a call from a State Police Colonel asking me to come to their headquarters for a surprise award ceremony where they recognized Axon rockstar Project Manager, Jenny Schupp for seamlessly upgrading them from a competing platform on to Axon. Great work, Jenny. So proud to have you on our team. Great tech and passionate people is just a magical combination and it works. Our momentum Fleet 3 has allowed us to continue to capture share with major cities, county sheriff\u2019s and state controls here in the domestic market. We\u2019ve converted several major agencies in the last year from competing platforms onto our network, joining our community. The whole ecosystem ties together our body cameras, fleet cameras, TASER weapons, drones and third-party centers with a growing suite of software capabilities and I\u2019m glad to see it\u2019s delighting our customers. We\u2019re laser focused on pursuing our mission and driving growth. And it\u2019s clear that our people are our best asset. As you\u2019ve heard from Luke over these years, we have been fortunate to attract people who are among the best in the world what they do. I\u2019m incredibly grateful and thankful to have these people on our team contributing to our success. Now, over to Luke to take you through some of our 2021 highlights in more detail.\nLuke Larson: Thanks, Rick. In 2021, Axon focus on our commitment to our mission, our customers and our employees. We continue to be in a period of rapid scale. Last year we hired more than 900 new Axon teammates and we set new company records by filing more than 100 patent applications. We also supported our customers through a period of turbulence. One of our initiatives included the creation and launch a Family First, a free and confidential mental health resource and training package for the families of law enforcement. Another fantastic initiative we launched last year was the Axon Roadshow. We hosted 200 events over the course of six months, where we visited customer agencies and gave demos of our products. We also grew our international markets with S\u00e3o Paulo Military Police adopting a large body camera deployment and the Dutch National Police undergoing a large TASER deployment. On the product front last year we launched Fleet 3 and ALPR, and demand has exceeded our expectations. As a result, Fleet bookings for 2021 far surpassed our projections and customers have raved and served as incredible references and our first launch of the Attorney Premiere in December opens up an entire new software category for us in the justice sector. While we\u2019re quick to highlight key wins in new market segments, our entire business has been able to achieve record results due to the stellar work that continues to be done by our state and local teams. Operationally, last quarter, we told you about industry-wide chips shortages that impacted our TASER 7 platform. We told you we had line of sight to clearing the backlog in the first half of 2022 and that remains the case. We continue to manage through challenges including delivery delays and our supply chain team is navigating extremely well. We also called out in today\u2019s Shareholder Letter, that approximately $15 million of AB3 is also shifting into 2022, as a result of an elongated supply chain. I want to note that we have been intentional over our preparedness, investing in manufacturing capacity and flexibility, thereby improving our ability to meet customer demand. We feel great about our pipeline and bookings and in what continues to be a very dynamic environment. As Rick noted, you often hear me post about our teams and the incomparable talent we have at Axon, recruiting is a major focus for us as we grow. We recently announced that we are opening an R&D hub in London, which will be our fifth after Scottsdale, Seattle; Tampere, Finland; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. And finally, if you know someone fantastic who wants to make an impact, we want the best people in the world to come to Axon, so please refer them to us. Now, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jawad Ahsan.\nJawad Ahsan: Excellent. I\u2019d like to start by recapping some of our financial highlights over the past few years. This is our third year in a row of 25% plus revenue growth. Our annual recurring revenue has tripled over those same past three years to $327 million and looking back over five years, our revenue has grown at a CAGR of 26% from 2016 to 2021. And over the same period, our adjusted EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 32%. We\u2019ve delivered both exciting topline growth and strong operating leverage, all while making investments that will not only continue these trends for years to come, but more importantly, help us achieve our mission to protect life. As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we intend to use this momentum to our advantage and stay on offense. What does that going to look like? We\u2019re introducing today a third pillar of our financial strategy, in addition to topline growth and bottomline leverage, and that third pillar is cash generation. We\u2019re laser focused on building an enterprise that will deliver 20% plus revenue growth for years to come, return increasing amounts of profitability to our shareholders as we grow and build a free cash flow generating machine that will make our businesses sustainable for the long-term and keep us nimble and flexible. This flexibility will be built on the stable foundation of a subscription-based business model that generates highly recurring cash flows. We recently talked about investing for growth in terms of R&D. We\u2019re still making those investments. But we also know that our continued growth at this pace will depend on more than just R&D. We\u2019ll need new sites and new offices around the world, as our global footprint expands. We\u2019ll need new facilities with new capabilities, both in terms of automation and streamline manufacturing, as well as showcase spaces for our technology, where we can collaborate with and gather feedback from our increasingly diverse customer and partner base. And finally, we\u2019ll also need the ability to move quickly when the right inorganic opportunity presents itself. It\u2019s for these reasons that we gave you more color than usual in our Shareholder Letter about our cash flow and CapEx expectations, including formal guidance for 2022. Transparency is of paramount importance to us and you can expect to hear more from us on this topic. We\u2019re incredibly proud of how we\u2019ve positioned the business to be cash generative for years to come. To recap, the three pillars in terms of what you can expect from us going forward. It\u2019s, number one, continued strong performance on the topline. Number two continued discipline in our operations, which will be evidenced by outperforming the rule of 40. And number three, a strong ramp in operating cash flow that will after the investments that we\u2019ve laid out, lead to a strong ramp in free cash flow. Looking ahead, we\u2019re also very excited by the next wave of new products and technologies that are going to become an important part of our growth story in their own right. Before we move to questions, I want to echo Rick\u2019s comments about the geopolitical crisis we are all facing as global citizens. Our thoughts are very much with the citizens of Ukraine today and we had Axon have never been more proud of our mission to protect life. And with that, Andrea, let\u2019s move to questions.\nA - Andrea James: Thanks so much, guys. Matt, can you bring everyone up into gallery view? Let me know when that, when we\u2019re all in gallery. Are we in gallery view? Okay. Awesome. Okay. Great. We\u2019ll take our first question from Jonathan Ho at William Blair. Go ahead, Jonathan.\nJonathan Ho: Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to start out with sort of, maybe what was different between your supply chain expectations around backlog and what ended up materializing around the quarter? And what\u2019s sort of giving you the confidence that you\u2019ll be able to sort of maintain, clearing the backlog by second quarter?\nRick Smith: Jonathan, thanks for that question. Yeah. We had just some material delays that impacted some of our original thinking. We still feel really strong about the total year outlook. And our supply chain teams just done a phenomenal job ensuring that we have line of sight to key revenue drivers. If I had to summarize it, I would say, we may see some quarter-to-quarter mix based on some of those material delays. But we still feel very strong for the year guidance that we published.\nJonathan Ho: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you referenced 25% of bookings coming from new types of customers. I just wanted to get a sense for, how much those customers can continue to contribute going forward, as we look at sort of that, that increasing ratio? What can that get to over time? Thank you.\nJawad Ahsan: Thanks, Jonathan. Nice to see you again. I\u2019d say, for international specifically, our goal is to have international outperformed the United States in bookings long-term. So I think we\u2019re just scratching the surface right now in that segment and the federal government will acknowledge our entire federal team. Just two years ago, we\u2019re -- was a kind of a $15 million to $20 million bookings business every year and last year we\u2019re just short of $100 million in that segment. And again, we think we\u2019re closer to the beginning then the end of that growth. And so we have a lot of confidence, especially in those two segments. And then, the Justice segment, the correction segment and enterprise, where we\u2019re starting to see some encouraging momentum as well. I -- one of the things that makes it challenging at times as our domestic segments still grows pretty substantially. But certainly, we hope and expect those new segments to outpace domestic and become a bigger and bigger part of that mix over time.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nAndrea James: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. Next question from Josh Reilly at Needham. Go ahead, Josh.\nJosh Reilly: Hey, there. Thanks for taking my questions and nice job on the quarter and year. So, I think, given the news in Ukraine here over the last week, curious how this maybe impacts your European opportunity, given the pipeline there in that region? And I know it\u2019s early, but do you anticipate any potential business disruption as a result of what\u2019s going on?\nRick Smith: We\u2019ve spent years and years building up a really strong team and pipeline in Europe. And last year the team really performed well against our goals. In terms of normalized five-year bookings we are up about 35%. In terms of 10-year bookings, we\u2019re up close to 60% in international. So these are deals that take a lot of time and energy to move through the sales cycle. And so the ones that we expect to close this year, largely we\u2019ve been working on already for quite some time. So I think we\u2019re in a place now where we feel like they\u2019re insulated from some of the uncertainty. But having said that, no one can predict the future in terms of how this will play out longer term. So, of course, there\u2019s a little bit more risk there today than there was last week, but we still feel really confident in our international and EMEA business throughout 2022.\nJosh Reilly: Okay. And then if you look at the increasing guidance and adjust for the $15 million of AB3 revenue that\u2019s pushed to 2022. How much of that $40 million increase is related to increase assumptions around TASER versus other products?\nRick Smith: I think it\u2019s a healthy mix. I think we believe the TASER business is going to grow this year across both domestic and our newer segments, and then video shipments and some other products, both on the software and hardware side will contribute there. We -- the team did a really nice job of not only closing out a strong Q4, but continuing to develop a pipeline for this year. And in Q1, we expect really significant book -- bookings growth over Q1 of last year and we\u2019re pushing really hard to make that trend continue throughout the year. So we think it\u2019ll be a mix of factors that drive that revenue and bookings result there.\nJosh Reilly: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nAndrea James: All right. Thank you. Will Power at Baird. Go ahead, Will.\nWill Power: All right. Great. Thanks. Rick, maybe starting with you, you all rolled out a bunch of new exciting products, whether it\u2019s VR, Bolt 2, Fleet 3, on and on Digital Evidence Management for justice. You look over the next five years, what should these new product categories get you most excited and what can be the biggest opportunity, I guess, growth for the company?\nRick Smith: Sorry, I had myself muted there, it\u2019s my patented move. That\u2019s kind of like asking me again, like which of my children I love the most. It\u2019s actually -- it\u2019s hard to pick. Like, over on the TASER side of the business, we\u2019ve got some crazy awesome new technology coming over the next 10 years. We are going to outperform a 9-millimeter pistol by 2030. I am highly confident. Over on the other side of the business, like solving problems for attorneys in the criminal justice system, that\u2019s high margin software. It\u2019s scaling rapidly, quickly. And we\u2019re passionate, our team over there talks about the opportunity to really impact fairness and efficiency in the justice system by having tools that enable public defenders, who may only have literally minutes with their clients have to work out plea deals to make them able to efficiently be able to process the video evidence and find what they need. So across our whole business, pretty much everything we do, impacts people\u2019s lives in an important way, because public safety is, it\u2019s really important and foundational work to a modern society. So I\u2019m excited across the board. I mean, consumer, I started this business to focus on the consumer space after a private citizen killed two of my friends, ruining their lives and now spending his life in jail. We need to give people something better than a bullet. It\u2019s 2022 and across the board, whether it\u2019s improving the efficiency of the justice system or saving lives or just putting medieval technology on the shelf, because we\u2019ve given the world something better. We\u2019re just excited across the board. So forgive my enthusiasm, but I actually love my job. I just got back from a two and a half day roadshow, saw 12 major agencies and I always come back super pumped. I literally got home about five minutes before the call. It\u2019s just such an awesome business to be in. And I\u2019ll just tell you this, I also, I\u2019m watching what\u2019s happening in Europe. And I can\u2019t help but think, like the world is looking at this quite differently. Like, what is this capricious use of war? It doesn\u2019t feel like it fits the modern world and I think we all were hoping it was gone. But the global revolves, you can feel it and I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019re turning a corner here. And I think we\u2019re seeing even in military circles, the acceptance of killing people is not what it was 100 years ago. And hopefully, we\u2019re going to get rid of it being accepted at all in the next century.\nWill Power: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. That all makes sense. Maybe if I can just ask the second one, either for you or Luke or whoever wants to take it. It has been a challenging hiring environment, especially for R&D talent and technology. I know you\u2019re opening a new hub in London, which presumably helps. Maybe just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of employee retention, difficulty hiring, how does that factor into plants and outlook there?\nRick Smith: Yeah. I\u2019m going to take that first, and Luke, I\u2019ll have you take the ball. Part of what we\u2019re doing in London as well, it\u2019s really important, we\u2019re beginning to continue to expand our global footprint that, we\u2019ve got a lot of customers in the U.K. and Scotland and across Europe. And we really feel it\u2019s incumbent on us to really have a global footprint, where we\u2019re sourcing talent around the world and putting that talent closer to our customers. So this both helps with a sourcing talent, but also we think from a customer intimacy perspective, it\u2019s getting help there as well. With that, Luke, can you take the rest on retention.\nLuke Larson: Yeah. Great question. As we, look, like in the last two years we\u2019ve seen this acceleration of remote work and that\u2019s given every employee in the world a lot of opportunities. I think a lot of companies are kind of scratching their heads going, how are we possibly going to retain people in this environment? I\u2019m super excited about that Axon, because I think we\u2019re going to be the beneficiary of that, because we built an amazing company. So when we go out and talk to candidates, we talk about the purpose and the mission that we have. We talked about the great team that we\u2019ve built and the talent that we\u2019ve attracted. I think one really exciting part of the business is the future growth that we see ahead of us. And so, that\u2019s not only for prospective employees, it\u2019s for existing employees as well. And so, I feel really confident about the team that we built and it\u2019s definitely a challenging hiring environment, but we think it\u2019s going to be one where we\u2019re going to thrive, because we built such a great business.\nRick Smith: Stay tuned at the end of the call. We\u2019ve got one more video for you, that the team put together, that really is showcases a bit of who we are and we\u2019re getting rave reviews from people seeing it online, who don\u2019t even know what we do, who want to come work for us. We aspire to have a place that not only works on big problems, but really has a good time doing it. It recognizes and celebrates the humanity of our people. We\u2019re all in this together working on problems we care about and that is resonating with our current employees and with folks we\u2019re trying to recruit in.\nWill Power: Yeah. Look forward to that.\nAndrea James: Yeah. Thanks. We\u2019re really excited to share that video with you at the end. So do stick around. Okay. Mita Marshall at Morgan Stanley. You are next.\nMita Marshall: Great. Thanks. You listed a number of kind of international agencies that you guys were having success with in the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of whether -- where you\u2019re seeing the most traction, either TASER s or body camera and just whether they\u2019re more likely to kind of bundle up front or if there\u2019s different needs with the software for those customers that maybe digging in on the international side and what traction you\u2019re seeing there? And then, maybe second, it sounded like you guys were able to kind of work around and find alternatives for a lot of the products, but just getting a sense of, if you think there\u2019s any price increases that will need to be passed on to customers? Thanks.\nRick Smith: Yeah. Thanks very much for the question. So, on international, I think, our focus is customer acquisition regardless of product. So I think some customers are better suited at the moment for TASER, are more interested in TASER s and others are pursuing body cameras or in-car video or even interview room. And for us our strategy has always been to make sure we can delight our customers with one of those products and then over time expand the ecosystem within each agency. And we really believe that\u2019s become a competitive differentiator for us in the United States over time and it will internationally as well. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little less common to see bundling of TASER s and body cams in most markets, the Commonwealth countries might be a little more common there. But it\u2019s still, in a lot of these markets, how can we get in there with any of our products and delight customers and build really strong productive trusting relationships. So that\u2019s really the focus internationally. And in terms of pricing, I think, we feel really good about where we stand right now. We\u2019ve -- we address pricing every year and meet as a team and decide kind of how best to go out to market and be fair in terms of the value that we\u2019re providing. And we don\u2019t at this point, anticipate passing any of the or passing any pricing increases along to our customers. We announced our new pricing in January. We feel great about it. We have many of our supplier contracts locked in. Our 10-year deals do contain escalator starting in year six to account for inflation and new products and new capabilities and so forth, and we continue to feel good about that.\nMita Marshall: Great.\nLuke Larson: I want to add on hear that one thing we are working on, that\u2019s why we laid it out for you in our cash estimates is our investment in automation, streamlining, manufacturing, labor reduction, right, that\u2019s a big investment we\u2019re making from a CapEx standpoint to help attack this from the cost side.\nMita Marshall: Perfect. Thanks for the context.\nAndrea James: Good. Thanks, Mita. Keith Housum at Northcoast. You\u2019re up next.\nKeith Housum: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Can you guys speak a little bit, perhaps, a crystal ball here, and perhaps, give us a little bit of a highlight in terms of what to expect for this year in terms of new product rollouts or updating existing ones, now AB3 is three years old, TASER, it\u2019s being in process. Perhaps, can you give us an update where you guys are out in the new products or in the improvements or changing or updating the old ones?\nRick Smith: Well, I\u2019ve got to contain my excitement here, you know that, Keith. The products are, we surprised that are getting to the end of their expected lifecycle, where do we start to expect to see some new ones coming along. So I can\u2019t give you any specifics. But we do get on a cadence of approximately two and a half to three years on body cameras and every five years on TASERs. And we just launched Fleet 3. There\u2019s a lot going on. But, unfortunately, I can\u2019t give you more than that, other than to share my smile with you and let you know, we got good stuff coming on the way.\nKeith Housum: Okay. I buy 3s in May 2018, correct, 2019, and mass, so just like probably I am missing for that one. My -- no comment for you guys necessary, my assumption is on that one. It\u2019s the next question more for Jawad. You guys did noted that you guys increased freight costs in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m assumed you got other costs and supply chain issues, can you perhaps give us some context what the impact was in the fourth quarter, how we should think about that in 2022?\nJawad Ahsan: Yeah. The impact is fairly muted on our margins when you saw gross margin compression, it was largely actually due to when we talked about the supply chain shortages that we had, unable to fulfill demand and so we had some fixed costs that were unable to be allocated over inventory and that caused a little bit of margin compression. But, overall, not a big disruption. This is again pointing back to the investments we\u2019re making in our manufacturing, processes, in automation to really get out ahead of that. We\u2019re seeing results. We\u2019ve been making those investments for a couple of years. They\u2019ve been on a bit of a smaller scale and now we\u2019re ramping those up because we\u2019re seeing such great benefits from those. And that\u2019s something that we expect to continue to pay dividends in the short-term and over the next few years, and as we, again, try to drive towards that long-term margin target of 30%.\nKeith Housum: Okay. So to recap, Jawad [ph], you don\u2019t expect any significant compression in 2022 because either of those issues.\nJawad Ahsan: That\u2019s correct.\nKeith Housum: \u2026on cost side. Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nAndrea James: Thank you, Keith. Next up it looks like Eric has dropped off, so we\u2019ll go to Paul Chung at JPMorgan. Go ahead, Paul.\nPaul Chung: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. So just -- I just want to talk about the kind of push out in 4Q revenues and kind of impact on the shape of your TASER contribution in 2022. And then how is your visibility on the weapons side and then given that higher subscription bundles, do we expect a little less volatility between the quarters? Then I\u2019ve a follow-up.\nRick Smith: Yeah. I think it\u2019s a good question. The teams worked really, really hard to get as much line of sight into the TASER supply chain as we can and they deserve a lot of credit for that. I think we feel very much that the outlook on supply chain does support our new revenue guidance. And so, as you remember in Q4, we did guide to around $204 million I think and surpassed that, and that just speaks to the fact that the team really did a good job pulling in every component that they could to be able to beat that guidance and we think we\u2019ve got a promising path forward in that regard. In terms of quarter-to-quarter flux, last year it became fairly consistent between Q2 and Q4. There was less kind of swing in the revenue results overall. I do think that is because the team is getting better and better at building a more substantial pipeline across segments and that allows us to have a little less execution risk quarter-to-quarter. So certainly every quarter we start with, how can we maximize the percentage of the pipeline that we close and that\u2019s going to continue to be a focus, and I really believe the team is primed for another really strong year in that regard.\nLuke Larson: And then Paul on your visibility question, we have got visibility to little over half, about half -- over half is booked, and it\u2019s one of the reasons we like to highlight our bookings number, because it\u2019s a really strong indicator of our future revenue growth.\nPaul Chung: And then on cash flow, very strong, so despite some of the component shortages here, talk about the working cap dynamics you expect over the year and then kind of benefits of a larger subscription base and then the shape of cash flows as we move through the year, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nRick Smith: Yeah. This is one we\u2019re really excited about. I\u2019m personally extremely\u2026\nPaul Chung: Yeah.\nRick Smith: \u2026excited about it. We\u2019ve built a business that is going to be hugely cash generative for years to come. This is something that we\u2019ve been building the foundation for many years and it\u2019s really starting to manifest itself in our cash flow statements. Last year we had a bit of a use of working capital and we expect that that\u2019s going to work itself out in the first half of the year. And going -- we obviously laid out the investment in the new campus, the automation, manufacturing initiatives. We have new sites and facilities opening around the world. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019ve given more visibility into our capital expenditure. We\u2019ve broken that out versus sort of like recurring business ongoing, excluding the one-time items. We are going to give you visibility to those one-time items over the next couple of years and we expect that once we\u2019re through the next couple of years with those investments that we\u2019re really going to be throwing off pretty significant amounts of cash.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Paul. And it looks like we have Astrid joined -- has joined us from Raymond James. Don\u2019t mean to put you on the spot, because your video is off, but do you have a question, Astrid? Okay. I\u2019m going to assume not. I\u2019ll give you another second. Is there anybody else who has a follow up? You can kind of come off mute. Don\u2019t all jump up at once. Oh, Will Power has his hand up. Go ahead.\nWill Power: There was a follow up, I was intrigued with -- on the corrections market look like a nice one in Ohio, I believe. So, I\u2019d love to get further color as to what the pipeline of opportunities looks like. It seems like that\u2019s been a kind of a budding opportunity for a while. Are we finally at the cusp of more significant win, so how do we think about that opportunity moving forward?\nRick Smith: Yeah. Absolutely. Deploying body camera at every correctional facility in Ohio was a huge win for the corrections team and one that took multiple years to deliver. There\u2019s a big market here. We often talk about internally like, for example, the California Department of Corrections is about the size of NYPD and office account. So there\u2019s a big market out there to go get. We\u2019ve reworked some of the offerings and packaging and bundling to better suit our corrections customers and we\u2019ve continued to build out that team over the last year and a half here. So we\u2019re really excited about the progress. There are still a lot of work to do and to do a different sale for sure than a lot of our more conventional law enforcement customers. But we expect that to be not only a part of our state and local growth moving forward, but also a part of our federal growth moving forward.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Will. Jonathan has a follow up. Go ahead, Jonathan.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, there. So just given when we started the call in VR, I thought it\u2019d be appropriate to just ask, just given the success that you\u2019re seeing there. Are there any stimulus funding or programs that can maybe drive even faster adoption in that VR space? And can you maybe remind us of how much of a step up in ASPs and you can see from sort of VR adoption? Thank you.\nRick Smith: Yeah. Absolutely. So, right now, if you buy a VR, our VR offering with TASER 7, it\u2019s about a $17 month uplift from the TASER 7 and we have some a la carte packages as well. I\u2019d say, like all of our products, early on we\u2019re far more focused on adoption than ASP right now. We believe that this is an extremely emerging and disruptive technology that is going to further our mission, obviously, the bullet, of course, we can do that through building a better and better TASER and we will. But the other side of that is making sure that we\u2019re able to simulate the type of stress that officers experience in the field. And so we really believe this is kind of our next big product category and we\u2019re really focused on becoming the market leader in this space. And like, we said this product outperformed both our body cameras and X26 in year one of sales, which is a great indicator. And the team\u2019s really focused on driving this business segment up past $100 million in bookings as fast as we can here.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nAndrea James: Rick, you\u2019re off mute, so you\u2019re going to close this out. Go ahead.\nRick Smith: Now, you made me want to double check and just make sure that I\u2019m off mute here. Well, hey, we\u2019re obviously just thrilled with the performance the team\u2019s been able to pull together over these past two years despite the pandemic and social unrest and now these new geopolitical challenges. But I have the great fortune to work with just some really awesome people who get out of bed, regardless of what\u2019s happening in the world and just get after our mission. So we want to conclude by sharing with you a really special project. Our team shot some drone footage of our current headquarters this week and we\u2019d love to take you through our Scottsdale office R&D and manufacturing facility. It\u2019s pretty cool. Check it out. [Video Presentation]",

            "content": "Excellent. I'd like to start by recapping some of our financial highlights over the past few years. This is our third year in a row of 25% plus revenue growth. Our annual recurring revenue has tripled over those same past three years to $327 million and looking back over five years, our revenue has grown at a CAGR of 26% from 2016 to 2021. And over the same period, our adjusted EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 32%. We've delivered both exciting topline growth and strong operating leverage, all while making investments that will not only continue these trends for years to come, but more importantly, help us achieve our mission to protect life. As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we intend to use this momentum to our advantage and stay on offense. What does that going to look like? We're introducing today a third pillar of our financial strategy, in addition to topline growth and bottomline leverage, and that third pillar is cash generation. We're laser focused on building an enterprise that will deliver 20% plus revenue growth for years to come, return increasing amounts of profitability to our shareholders as we grow and build a free cash flow generating machine that will make our businesses sustainable for the long-term and keep us nimble and flexible. This flexibility will be built on the stable foundation of a subscription-based business model that generates highly recurring cash flows. We recently talked about investing for growth in terms of R&D. We're still making those investments. But we also know that our continued growth at this pace will depend on more than just R&D. We'll need new sites and new offices around the world, as our global footprint expands. We'll need new facilities with new capabilities, both in terms of automation and streamline manufacturing, as well as showcase spaces for our technology, where we can collaborate with and gather feedback from our increasingly diverse customer and partner base. And finally, we'll also need the ability to move quickly when the right inorganic opportunity presents itself. It's for these reasons that we gave you more color than usual in our Shareholder Letter about our cash flow and CapEx expectations, including formal guidance for 2022. Transparency is of paramount importance to us and you can expect to hear more from us on this topic. We're incredibly proud of how we've positioned the business to be cash generative for years to come. To recap, the three pillars in terms of what you can expect from us going forward. It's, number one, continued strong performance on the topline. Number two continued discipline in our operations, which will be evidenced by outperforming the rule of 40. And number three, a strong ramp in operating cash flow that will after the investments that we've laid out, lead to a strong ramp in free cash flow. Looking ahead, we're also very excited by the next wave of new products and technologies that are going to become an important part of our growth story in their own right. Before we move to questions, I want to echo Rick's comments about the geopolitical crisis we are all facing as global citizens. Our thoughts are very much with the citizens of Ukraine today and we had Axon have never been more proud of our mission to protect life. And with that, Andrea, let's move to questions. Thanks, Jonathan. Nice to see you again. I'd say, for international specifically, our goal is to have international outperformed the United States in bookings long-term. So I think we're just scratching the surface right now in that segment and the federal government will acknowledge our entire federal team. Just two years ago, we're -- was a kind of a $15 million to $20 million bookings business every year and last year we're just short of $100 million in that segment. And again, we think we're closer to the beginning then the end of that growth. And so we have a lot of confidence, especially in those two segments. And then, the Justice segment, the correction segment and enterprise, where we're starting to see some encouraging momentum as well. I -- one of the things that makes it challenging at times as our domestic segments still grows pretty substantially. But certainly, we hope and expect those new segments to outpace domestic and become a bigger and bigger part of that mix over time. Yeah. The impact is fairly muted on our margins when you saw gross margin compression, it was largely actually due to when we talked about the supply chain shortages that we had, unable to fulfill demand and so we had some fixed costs that were unable to be allocated over inventory and that caused a little bit of margin compression. But, overall, not a big disruption. This is again pointing back to the investments we're making in our manufacturing, processes, in automation to really get out ahead of that. We're seeing results. We've been making those investments for a couple of years. They've been on a bit of a smaller scale and now we're ramping those up because we're seeing such great benefits from those. And that's something that we expect to continue to pay dividends in the short-term and over the next few years, and as we, again, try to drive towards that long-term margin target of 30%. That's correct."

            "name": "Luke Larson",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. In 2021, Axon focus on our commitment to our mission, our customers and our employees. We continue to be in a period of rapid scale. Last year we hired more than 900 new Axon teammates and we set new company records by filing more than 100 patent applications. We also supported our customers through a period of turbulence. One of our initiatives included the creation and launch a Family First, a free and confidential mental health resource and training package for the families of law enforcement. Another fantastic initiative we launched last year was the Axon Roadshow. We hosted 200 events over the course of six months, where we visited customer agencies and gave demos of our products. We also grew our international markets with Sa\u0303o Paulo Military Police adopting a large body camera deployment and the Dutch National Police undergoing a large TASER deployment. On the product front last year we launched Fleet 3 and ALPR, and demand has exceeded our expectations. As a result, Fleet bookings for 2021 far surpassed our projections and customers have raved and served as incredible references and our first launch of the Attorney Premiere in December opens up an entire new software category for us in the justice sector. While we're quick to highlight key wins in new market segments, our entire business has been able to achieve record results due to the stellar work that continues to be done by our state and local teams. Operationally, last quarter, we told you about industry-wide chips shortages that impacted our TASER 7 platform. We told you we had line of sight to clearing the backlog in the first half of 2022 and that remains the case. We continue to manage through challenges including delivery delays and our supply chain team is navigating extremely well. We also called out in today's Shareholder Letter, that approximately $15 million of AB3 is also shifting into 2022, as a result of an elongated supply chain. I want to note that we have been intentional over our preparedness, investing in manufacturing capacity and flexibility, thereby improving our ability to meet customer demand. We feel great about our pipeline and bookings and in what continues to be a very dynamic environment. As Rick noted, you often hear me post about our teams and the incomparable talent we have at Axon, recruiting is a major focus for us as we grow. We recently announced that we are opening an R&D hub in London, which will be our fifth after Scottsdale, Seattle; Tampere, Finland; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. And finally, if you know someone fantastic who wants to make an impact, we want the best people in the world to come to Axon, so please refer them to us. Now, with that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jawad Ahsan. Yeah. Great question. As we, look, like in the last two years we've seen this acceleration of remote work and that's given every employee in the world a lot of opportunities. I think a lot of companies are kind of scratching their heads going, how are we possibly going to retain people in this environment? I'm super excited about that Axon, because I think we're going to be the beneficiary of that, because we built an amazing company. So when we go out and talk to candidates, we talk about the purpose and the mission that we have. We talked about the great team that we've built and the talent that we've attracted. I think one really exciting part of the business is the future growth that we see ahead of us. And so, that's not only for prospective employees, it's for existing employees as well. And so, I feel really confident about the team that we built and it's definitely a challenging hiring environment, but we think it's going to be one where we're going to thrive, because we built such a great business. I want to add on hear that one thing we are working on, that's why we laid it out for you in our cash estimates is our investment in automation, streamlining, manufacturing, labor reduction, right, that's a big investment we're making from a CapEx standpoint to help attack this from the cost side. And then Paul on your visibility question, we have got visibility to little over half, about half -- over half is booked, and it's one of the reasons we like to highlight our bookings number, because it's a really strong indicator of our future revenue growth."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Andrea. I was just waiting for the queue here. I love waiting -- watching those videos. We've got the most creative finance team in the business. And as you can see from that video, we've been looking forward to sharing results from the best year in Axon's history. But we're heavy hearted to do this on a day when democracy is under attack and wars breaking out in Europe. But we don't get to choose whether the times we live in will include geopolitical instability or global pandemics. What we can choose are our principles and how we respond. We stand for transparency, truth and protecting life. Our products are designed to strengthen trust in the rule of law and they support the United Nations 16th Sustainable Development Goal to foster peace, justice and strong institutions. My thought are especially with the U.K., Ukraine national police who are our customer, as well as our excellent teammates in Ukraine. As we kick off 2022, I'm confident Axon's best days are ahead of us. We are prioritizing our people and giving them a platform to further excel at what they do. Last month, Dr. Richard Carmona announced he will be retiring from Axon's Board after 15 years of service. Dr. Carmona has been a tremendous contributor to Axon, helping us shape strategy and positioning Axon as we evolved from a single product company known as TASER to where we are today. He is simply a wonderful human being. We're incredibly grateful to him not only for his 15 years of service, but also for the way forward he helped us to define. As I reflect on what is driving our strength, it is a powerful combination of solving real challenges for our customers, creating a better user experience and attracting passionate talent. It's really our emphasis on building software at the core that creates a great user experience. Historically, our competitors built software to fit RFPs, which check a lot of boxes, but ultimately, does not function well in the hands of user. We've been religious about understanding our customer's needs and building software and products that delight them when they use them. When customers test Axon solutions, we stand apart. As we consider the competitive landscape. One of the most important factors that sets us apart is that we truly have a highly integrated suite, a high performance ecosystem that seamlessly connects hardware, software and our community of users to achieve our mission of delivering a safer world. When competitors talk about winning market share, it's mostly focused on lower margin hardware buyers who don't get value great software and usually aren't ready to advance to the cloud. We look forward to welcoming those customers down the road, just like the many agencies here in the U.S. that are upgrading from continuing platforms to the Axon ecosystem. Perhaps even more important than the technology we've built is the mission mindset of our employees that sets us apart. I regularly hear from chiefs raving about their positive experience with our employees, because they are so passionate about helping our customers succeed. I recently got a call from a State Police Colonel asking me to come to their headquarters for a surprise award ceremony where they recognized Axon rockstar Project Manager, Jenny Schupp for seamlessly upgrading them from a competing platform on to Axon. Great work, Jenny. So proud to have you on our team. Great tech and passionate people is just a magical combination and it works. Our momentum Fleet 3 has allowed us to continue to capture share with major cities, county sheriff's and state controls here in the domestic market. We've converted several major agencies in the last year from competing platforms onto our network, joining our community. The whole ecosystem ties together our body cameras, fleet cameras, TASER weapons, drones and third-party centers with a growing suite of software capabilities and I'm glad to see it's delighting our customers. We're laser focused on pursuing our mission and driving growth. And it's clear that our people are our best asset. As you've heard from Luke over these years, we have been fortunate to attract people who are among the best in the world what they do. I'm incredibly grateful and thankful to have these people on our team contributing to our success. Now, over to Luke to take you through some of our 2021 highlights in more detail. Jonathan, thanks for that question. Yeah. We had just some material delays that impacted some of our original thinking. We still feel really strong about the total year outlook. And our supply chain teams just done a phenomenal job ensuring that we have line of sight to key revenue drivers. If I had to summarize it, I would say, we may see some quarter-to-quarter mix based on some of those material delays. But we still feel very strong for the year guidance that we published. We've spent years and years building up a really strong team and pipeline in Europe. And last year the team really performed well against our goals. In terms of normalized five-year bookings we are up about 35%. In terms of 10-year bookings, we're up close to 60% in international. So these are deals that take a lot of time and energy to move through the sales cycle. And so the ones that we expect to close this year, largely we've been working on already for quite some time. So I think we're in a place now where we feel like they're insulated from some of the uncertainty. But having said that, no one can predict the future in terms of how this will play out longer term. So, of course, there's a little bit more risk there today than there was last week, but we still feel really confident in our international and EMEA business throughout 2022. I think it's a healthy mix. I think we believe the TASER business is going to grow this year across both domestic and our newer segments, and then video shipments and some other products, both on the software and hardware side will contribute there. We -- the team did a really nice job of not only closing out a strong Q4, but continuing to develop a pipeline for this year. And in Q1, we expect really significant book -- bookings growth over Q1 of last year and we're pushing really hard to make that trend continue throughout the year. So we think it'll be a mix of factors that drive that revenue and bookings result there. Sorry, I had myself muted there, it's my patented move. That's kind of like asking me again, like which of my children I love the most. It's actually -- it's hard to pick. Like, over on the TASER side of the business, we've got some crazy awesome new technology coming over the next 10 years. We are going to outperform a 9-millimeter pistol by 2030. I am highly confident. Over on the other side of the business, like solving problems for attorneys in the criminal justice system, that's high margin software. It's scaling rapidly, quickly. And we're passionate, our team over there talks about the opportunity to really impact fairness and efficiency in the justice system by having tools that enable public defenders, who may only have literally minutes with their clients have to work out plea deals to make them able to efficiently be able to process the video evidence and find what they need. So across our whole business, pretty much everything we do, impacts people's lives in an important way, because public safety is, it's really important and foundational work to a modern society. So I'm excited across the board. I mean, consumer, I started this business to focus on the consumer space after a private citizen killed two of my friends, ruining their lives and now spending his life in jail. We need to give people something better than a bullet. It's 2022 and across the board, whether it's improving the efficiency of the justice system or saving lives or just putting medieval technology on the shelf, because we've given the world something better. We're just excited across the board. So forgive my enthusiasm, but I actually love my job. I just got back from a two and a half day roadshow, saw 12 major agencies and I always come back super pumped. I literally got home about five minutes before the call. It's just such an awesome business to be in. And I'll just tell you this, I also, I'm watching what's happening in Europe. And I can't help but think, like the world is looking at this quite differently. Like, what is this capricious use of war? It doesn't feel like it fits the modern world and I think we all were hoping it was gone. But the global revolves, you can feel it and I'm hoping that we're turning a corner here. And I think we're seeing even in military circles, the acceptance of killing people is not what it was 100 years ago. And hopefully, we're going to get rid of it being accepted at all in the next century. Yeah. I'm going to take that first, and Luke, I'll have you take the ball. Part of what we're doing in London as well, it's really important, we're beginning to continue to expand our global footprint that, we've got a lot of customers in the U.K. and Scotland and across Europe. And we really feel it's incumbent on us to really have a global footprint, where we're sourcing talent around the world and putting that talent closer to our customers. So this both helps with a sourcing talent, but also we think from a customer intimacy perspective, it's getting help there as well. With that, Luke, can you take the rest on retention. Stay tuned at the end of the call. We've got one more video for you, that the team put together, that really is showcases a bit of who we are and we're getting rave reviews from people seeing it online, who don't even know what we do, who want to come work for us. We aspire to have a place that not only works on big problems, but really has a good time doing it. It recognizes and celebrates the humanity of our people. We're all in this together working on problems we care about and that is resonating with our current employees and with folks we're trying to recruit in. Yeah. Thanks very much for the question. So, on international, I think, our focus is customer acquisition regardless of product. So I think some customers are better suited at the moment for TASER, are more interested in TASER s and others are pursuing body cameras or in-car video or even interview room. And for us our strategy has always been to make sure we can delight our customers with one of those products and then over time expand the ecosystem within each agency. And we really believe that's become a competitive differentiator for us in the United States over time and it will internationally as well. I'd say it's a little less common to see bundling of TASER s and body cams in most markets, the Commonwealth countries might be a little more common there. But it's still, in a lot of these markets, how can we get in there with any of our products and delight customers and build really strong productive trusting relationships. So that's really the focus internationally. And in terms of pricing, I think, we feel really good about where we stand right now. We've -- we address pricing every year and meet as a team and decide kind of how best to go out to market and be fair in terms of the value that we're providing. And we don't at this point, anticipate passing any of the or passing any pricing increases along to our customers. We announced our new pricing in January. We feel great about it. We have many of our supplier contracts locked in. Our 10-year deals do contain escalator starting in year six to account for inflation and new products and new capabilities and so forth, and we continue to feel good about that. Well, I've got to contain my excitement here, you know that, Keith. The products are, we surprised that are getting to the end of their expected lifecycle, where do we start to expect to see some new ones coming along. So I can't give you any specifics. But we do get on a cadence of approximately two and a half to three years on body cameras and every five years on TASERs. And we just launched Fleet 3. There's a lot going on. But, unfortunately, I can't give you more than that, other than to share my smile with you and let you know, we got good stuff coming on the way. Yeah. I think it's a good question. The teams worked really, really hard to get as much line of sight into the TASER supply chain as we can and they deserve a lot of credit for that. I think we feel very much that the outlook on supply chain does support our new revenue guidance. And so, as you remember in Q4, we did guide to around $204 million I think and surpassed that, and that just speaks to the fact that the team really did a good job pulling in every component that they could to be able to beat that guidance and we think we've got a promising path forward in that regard. In terms of quarter-to-quarter flux, last year it became fairly consistent between Q2 and Q4. There was less kind of swing in the revenue results overall. I do think that is because the team is getting better and better at building a more substantial pipeline across segments and that allows us to have a little less execution risk quarter-to-quarter. So certainly every quarter we start with, how can we maximize the percentage of the pipeline that we close and that's going to continue to be a focus, and I really believe the team is primed for another really strong year in that regard. Yeah. This is one we're really excited about. I'm personally extremely... ...excited about it. We've built a business that is going to be hugely cash generative for years to come. This is something that we've been building the foundation for many years and it's really starting to manifest itself in our cash flow statements. Last year we had a bit of a use of working capital and we expect that that's going to work itself out in the first half of the year. And going -- we obviously laid out the investment in the new campus, the automation, manufacturing initiatives. We have new sites and facilities opening around the world. And so that's one of the reasons that we've given more visibility into our capital expenditure. We've broken that out versus sort of like recurring business ongoing, excluding the one-time items. We are going to give you visibility to those one-time items over the next couple of years and we expect that once we're through the next couple of years with those investments that we're really going to be throwing off pretty significant amounts of cash. Yeah. Absolutely. Deploying body camera at every correctional facility in Ohio was a huge win for the corrections team and one that took multiple years to deliver. There's a big market here. We often talk about internally like, for example, the California Department of Corrections is about the size of NYPD and office account. So there's a big market out there to go get. We've reworked some of the offerings and packaging and bundling to better suit our corrections customers and we've continued to build out that team over the last year and a half here. So we're really excited about the progress. There are still a lot of work to do and to do a different sale for sure than a lot of our more conventional law enforcement customers. But we expect that to be not only a part of our state and local growth moving forward, but also a part of our federal growth moving forward. Yeah. Absolutely. So, right now, if you buy a VR, our VR offering with TASER 7, it's about a $17 month uplift from the TASER 7 and we have some a la carte packages as well. I'd say, like all of our products, early on we're far more focused on adoption than ASP right now. We believe that this is an extremely emerging and disruptive technology that is going to further our mission, obviously, the bullet, of course, we can do that through building a better and better TASER and we will. But the other side of that is making sure that we're able to simulate the type of stress that officers experience in the field. And so we really believe this is kind of our next big product category and we're really focused on becoming the market leader in this space. And like, we said this product outperformed both our body cameras and X26 in year one of sales, which is a great indicator. And the team's really focused on driving this business segment up past $100 million in bookings as fast as we can here. Now, you made me want to double check and just make sure that I'm off mute here. Well, hey, we're obviously just thrilled with the performance the team's been able to pull together over these past two years despite the pandemic and social unrest and now these new geopolitical challenges. But I have the great fortune to work with just some really awesome people who get out of bed, regardless of what's happening in the world and just get after our mission. So we want to conclude by sharing with you a really special project. Our team shot some drone footage of our current headquarters this week and we'd love to take you through our Scottsdale office R&D and manufacturing facility. It's pretty cool. Check it out.

        "content": "Andrea James : Okay.\nRick Smith: All right. Great job, Angel and Andrea and our whole IR team. You guys just really did a nice job on that video. I hope our investors enjoyed it. So as you can see from our results, our teams are continuing to execute at the highest level. Perhaps the strongest growth indicator is record bookings of $0.5 billion in a single quarter. As bookings eventually flow through to revenue, Axon has become a substantially larger business in the coming years. And the momentum is really strong, with sales contracts booked up to 70% year-to-date compared to last year, and we expect another record bookings quarter in Q4. I'm proud of the results we're delivering in 2021 and even more energized by the opportunity in front of us. We've demonstrated our ability to scale the business and drive leverage in our model. Now, we're expanding our growth story as we continue to introduce new products, selling to new customer market segments and ad sales channels across geographies. Today, we're addressing an even larger TAM. As you saw in the video, our current estimates point to a total addressable market of $52 billion. With our top-line projected to reach at least $1 billion next year, you can see there's enormous white space that had. By way of example, in early October AXON had its largest ever presence at the Association of the United States Army's Annual Conference in Washington, DC. This provided us with an opportunity to showcase our AXON transformative solutions for law enforcement position us to disrupt the U.S. defense market, giving us a seat at the table to begin influencing how the military responds towards to the future. As I watched the helicopters evacuate our embassy in Kabul, it struck me that the United States has effectively not achieved durable, strategic success in our last 3 wars. And it's not for lack of sufficient lethality. Our military is the greatest fighting machine in the history of the world, with the most lethal and precise weapons. Yet, the more we killed in Vietnam, the more we lost the hearts and minds of the very people we needed to win over. And the same phenomenon played out in Iraq and Afghanistan. We can no longer kill our way to success in modern conflicts. And I believe the ability to capture bad actors will become ever more strategically valuable, and we intend to lead the way. As the world news is at a faster pace, Axon is remaining at the forefront of bringing transformative technologies to market. We're innovators at our core. You can see that when you look at our history. We signed the incorporation papers for TASER at my dining room table 28 years ago. And since that time our mission has remained unchanged, but our organization has significantly evolved. And today, we have a broad ecosystem of public safety products. We have continually found new ways to serve our customers from disruptive technologies and software, even when they met with initial resistance. We've always said extremely high bars for ourselves at Axon but we found that great challenges make us rise to meet them. Earlier this month, we held our 6th Annual Axon Accelerate Conference right here in Phoenix, and it sure felt great to be back in person with all our customers and colleagues. The theme of this year's conference, and the topic of my opening keynote, was that change is inevitable and today, technology is moving at an exponential pace. From virtual reality training to our drone program, Axon Air, to automatic license plate reader technology and transcription, we're unlocking the power of technology to reach our North Star of obsoleting the bullet and outperforming the 9-millimeter pistol and stopping power by 2030. Amid Accelerate, we introduced our next moonshot. Together with our customers in public safety, within the next 10 years, we aim to cut officer-involved shootings by half. We believe we can accomplish this with new technologies, new training procedures, new policies, and even new regulations to guide the way. In fact, I used to accelerate as an opportunity to introduce a regulatory framework. The 3 Laws of first respond to robotics to begin a critically important discussion of how we use robotics, not to kill each other, but specifically to avoid harming each other, with new ways to capture dangerous subjects. Any decision that impacts the human subject for robot must be made by an authenticated human operator accepting legal and moreover responsibility. That are first proposed law, second, there should be no lethal force. De -escalation should be the primary goal in the minimal use of force to stop a threat. And then the 3rd is that any institute of force deployed by a robotic system should be recorded in full audio video in all user data and reviewed by an independent oversight committee. I will be hosting a Reddit AMA in December to gather public input on these guidelines. We're proud of our history of increasing mechanisms of control and accountability to ensure that powerful new technologies are used for good from the data logs and the TASER to the very existence of body cameras and our ethical product framework that we use to guide our ALPR development. And now we are leading the way to set the regulatory framework years ahead of advanced non-lethal robotics technology. We're excited to continue to blaze new trails in our mission to end killing. We were fortunate to close out 3 days of robust, interactive dialogue at Accelerate with a keynote where I got to interview Former President George W. Bush. He delivered an incredibly inspiring talk, expressing gratitude to public safety officers and calling for civility to all citizens, which is squarely aligned with our mission to protect life, capture truth, and accelerate justice. And at the end of today's call, we're going to play for you a very powerful moment from Accelerate, so please stay tuned after the Q&A. And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Luke Larson, our President.\nLuke Larson : Thanks, Rick. Let me start by echoing your sentiment around Accelerate. We believe it all starts with creating a great experience for the customer, which means more than just listening. It's anticipating their needs by mapping technologies to insightful opportunities. A level of customer engagement we saw this year is a testament to the transformative power of the public safety platform we build. We're obsessed with creating value in a unique way that no one else can by solving real problems with solutions people are willing to use. Who is a phenomenal week learning from customers from all over the world I could not be more excited for the road ahead. Huge shout out to our marketing sales product teams and really all the employees that are icon and made such an impact on experience. The business continues to grow at a fast pace, which means recruiting and fostering the best and most diverse talent is critical to our success. Our ability to retain top talent not only allows Axon to move increasingly closer to accomplishing our mission, but also allows us to establish new goals along the way. To do this, we need to continue creating an organization that is future-proof, resilient to disruption, and at the forefront of innovation. We are currently hiring over 300 roles and we have embraced remote work as an opportunity to expand our talent pool, pooling from the best-in-class resources around the globe. How our employees spend their lives matter, which is why we put a great deal of consideration into the culture we are creating and the values we want to embody as we build the future. This means we're doubling down on our Jet-I and learning development initiatives. The teams we built, our unparalleled and it's incredible watching the collective hard work and dedication to our mission. We're laser-focused on how do we attract, retain, and develop the best talent. You know someone great that wants to make a great impact, send them our way. As we round out the year, we feel great about our product pipeline. We're finishing 2021 with exceptional bookings, which includes $30 million of TASER 7 revenue that we expected to deliver in Q4, but it's now just shifting into the first half of 2022. This is the result of an industry-wide chip shortage that impacted our TASER 7 platform. The supply chain conversation is universal right now, and while we are not immune, our teams are definitely navigating the situation. We have incredibly strong relationships and a long history with our supply chain partners who are invested in Axon's mission and are aligned in helping us meet our pipeline. Teamwork is harder than it seems on the surface and as our Company's skilled globally, it requires a consistent commitment to operate as 1 team. We're proud of our supply chain team to have done a tremendous job helping us manage through the global supply chain prices. While we've experienced some delays and the potential for interruption remains, we have line of sight to clearance in the first half of 2022 and continue to be confident in our ability to meet the needs of our customers and deliver on our annual revenue guidance, in spite of these challenges. I want to reiterate, we have line of sight to clearing the backlog in the first half of the year. We feel great about our pipeline and hoping to what continues to be a dynamic environment. Now, I will turn the call over to Axon's Chief Financial Officer, Jawad.\nJawad Ahsan : Thanks, Luke. I also want to start by echoing the excitement over our Accelerate conference. Meeting with our customers, partners, and employees from around the world was super energizing. It reinforced for me that Axon sits squarely at the intersection of social justice and advanced technology with a mission that galvanizes all of our stakeholders. These stakeholders include you, our investors. While we weren't able to offer an investor track at Accelerate this year, you've been top of mind for us. In light of feedback we received at our last proxy, we've been conducting a listening campaign to gather more specific feedback from our investors on our approach to governance in ESG. The input we've received has been invaluable and we look forward to sharing the outcome of these discussions in the coming months. Now, over the past several years, you've seen us invest aggressively in R&D and channel expansion. We've deployed capital to strategic partnerships, putting an early stake in the ground on emerging technologies and trends. These actions have enabled us to unlock transformative new products like VR and Respond new customer market segments like Federal and Justice, and new geographic regions worldwide. Today, we're excited to share that as a result of our strategic planning and continued investments, we're projecting substantial runway for growth with a new and updated Total Addressable Market or TAM. Our new TAM is almost double the last one that we shared with you. While our penetration in this new TAM is still relatively low, it's absolutely our intention to serve these markets with the investments we have in place, which will see us bring exciting new products to market over the next 18 to 24 months. There are two areas in particular I want to highlight. First, federal, we had Richard Coleman to run our federal business in 2018, and he has since built a stellar team who's performance has exceeded our expectations. We now view the federal team for Axon as a $9 billion opportunity across taser devices, body-worn cameras, demos, and other software. We count among our customers today, several of the branches of the federal government, including the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and the Drug Enforcement Agency. We've also been driving adoption of our new multi-jurisdictional sharing feature, which is enabling state and local agencies to seamlessly share evidence with U.S. attorneys. To better serve federal customers who have sensitive law enforcement information, We've made an investment to ensure our software complies with the Civilian Fed Rate High and the Defense Impact Level 5 security standards. At these security levels, we anticipate being able to offer a DEM solution to all 90+ federal law enforcement organization s across civilian and defense agencies. After a strong third quarter in which we added $35 million in new deals, we are on track to have another record year for federal bookings. Next, I want to briefly double-click on consumer. Axon has, since its inception, always had a consumer business, but it's historically not been one that we've devoted meaningful R&D to. With the ongoing development of our exciting new TASER device technology, we've committed to releasing a host of new personal safety devices over the next few years that will help advance our mission to truly obsolete the bullet. We also intend to begin offering personal safety solutions to mobile applications over this time frame. In our shareholder letter, we highlighted a TASER device penetration is less than 25% in the U.S. and even lower globally, but that represents the professional user. The penetration in consumer is virtually 0 in an $11 billion market, which means we have a tremendous runway ahead in just a segment alone. To be clear, we're still very early announcing consumer, but we have the alignment, the technology, the strategy, and most importantly, the mission to drive this growth. Now, before we open up the call to questions, I want to highlight 3 themes that we'd like you to take away this quarter. 1, we are significantly underpenetrated on our growing global TAM. 2, we're delivering against the rule of 40, investing for growth while achieving leverage. 3. Our year-to-date results and outlook for 2022 are a waypoint in towards building a much larger Company that is synonymous with public safety and protecting life. As we look ahead to 2022, we're carrying a ton of momentum into the new year. Our 2022 revenue projection has strengthened to at least $1 billion on top of what we expect will be at least 25% year-over-year growth in 2021. We added a record $28 million in ARR this past quarter to bring our total ARR to $288 million. We have an exciting runway ahead of us, and we look forward to sharing updates on our progress in the coming quarters. With that, Angel, let's move to questions.\nA - Angel Ambrosio: Okay. Thanks, Jawad and team. And as Rick noted, as we move into Q&A, I would encourage you all to stay tuned. If we have the time, we have a special surprise for you at the end of today's call. Moderators, can you bring everyone up into gal review? Okay. Great. All right. Our first question comes from Josh Reilly at Needham. Go ahead, Josh.\nJoshua Reilly: All right. Thanks, guys. Nice job on the quarter here. Maybe we'll just start with the $30 million shipped in Q4 teams or revenue. Would you expect all that to hit here in Q1 or will be more evenly spread out through the first half? And then what are the puts and takes on the timing of that revenue hitting?\nRick Smith: Thanks a lot for the question, Josh. I think at this point, we do see it hitting in both Q1 and Q2. And certainly, it's a challenging supply chain environment across the world right now and the team's doing a great job navigating through that. And so, of course, we're hoping we can fulfill as much of that in Q1 as we can, but realistically it'll be across Q1 and Q2.\nJoshua Reilly: Okay, great. And then maybe just a follow-up on Fleet 3. As that's launching here, is there going to be any impact to that production ramp given the semiconductor supply chain challenges? And then, is there going to be any initial impact to gross margin as a result of this ramp due to the Fleet 3 mix coming in as well?\nRick Smith: I let Jawad answer the second part of that question. But on Fleet 3, the demand has been very, very high, higher than we've ever seen for our in-car video products before. So we are shipping a record numbers of Fleet 3 as compared to Fleet 1 and Fleet 2 and we expect that to continue throughout next year. We are oversubscribed for the product right now and I think that speaks more towards the demand than anything else but we do expect to shift large quantities relative to previous versions in Q1 and moving forward, I'm sorry the Q4 of this year and moving forward and Q1.\nJawad Ahsan : Then Josh, the question on gross margins, we're not expecting at this point any impact from Fleet on gross margins.\nJoshua Reilly: Awesome. Thanks, guys. I'll move on here.\nAngel Ambrosio: Okay. Next question comes from analyst Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Go ahead, Jonathan.\nJonathan Ho : Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on another quarter of strong results. As we look at your revised TAM estimates, can you talk about maybe why the decision now to sort of update the TAM and maybe what underpins some of these assumptions since it seems like the markets appear to be a lot larger than you previously thought?\nJawad Ahsan : Yes, I'll start with that 1, John, and thanks for the question. So, we've been, as we talked about for the past few years, investing for growth beyond the TASER devices and body cameras, and we've given you flavors here and there of the markets that we're aiming towards the new products and segments. And what we wanted to do is reflect accurately how the business is oriented today. Our TAM has been expanding in the past few years, but that's also because the lens that we're looking at our business through has been widening as well, and things like VR, a bigger presence in federal, more of a focus on consumer; these investments are in-flight now, as I mentioned they're still very, very early inning s but its TAM release speaks more to our ambition. We wanted to align how we're thinking about our TAM opportunity with how we're investing for growth today. And we wanted to make sure that you guys are thinking about the same way that we are.\nJonathan Ho : Got it. And then when we look at this revised opportunity, what are the investments that you need to make to sort of unlock these additional markets? What are the most impactful ones, if you can just highlight that for us? Thank you.\nJawad Ahsan : Yes, the great thing about it is it's not a lot of incremental investment. The beauty of Axon business today is that the technology we have for TASER, for example, right? We've been investing in TASER for quite some time. We've talked a lot about the next-generation TASER technology, we're very excited about. And that technology is going to be able to serve our domestic and international law enforcement markets, it's going to be able to serve our federal markets, correction, enterprise security; it's going to, in a large way be able to translate to consumer as well. And so what we're really looking to do is gain leverage on the investments that we're already making. The same thing holds true with body camera and DEMS. You look at the body camera and DEMS product, it's really an enterprise solution that happens to be oriented towards law enforcement today and is geared towards law enforcement. We think that there are other use cases for that technology, and there are new areas like VR training that we are making a new incremental investment. In that content, there the demand is extremely strong. And in drones, here, we're looking to partner a little bit more and find the right partners to help us get into those markets. But what you should read into this is that we're not looking to really expand or to get too far ahead of our skis as far as investments into new technologies that's really driving leverage from the one that we have.\nJonathan Ho : Fantastic. Thank you\nAngel Ambrosio: Okay. Next -- next question comes from analyst Brian Gesuale at Raymond James. Go ahead, Brian. We also have Astrid on the call. so Astrid, if you would prefer to ask the question, you can go ahead and do that as well. Maybe we'll give you both a second and we will go to Paul Chung from JPMorgan.\nPaul Chung: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So just on your annual software contracts, what the customer is kind of what more of? How are you thinking about the dynamic between the new seats and increase in market share? And what are some of the upcoming features we should expect to kind of further drive that launch there?\nRick Smith: Paul, thanks for the question. I think the good news here is that the product team has done a fantastic job delivering several value-added feature sets over the last couple of years. And we're now seeing the market really start to value those. One of those is performance which measures how officers are complying with their agency policy. There's updated redaction tools, there's a product called Standards, which is our first module of our records products. And ultimately, as we bundle the solutions together in our officer safety plan offerings, we're seeing more and more customers buy those offerings. In fact, we've seen about double the number of licenses purchased this year, so far on that plan as last year and we only achieved through the year. The 2 to 3 quarters, I'd say so. There's a lot of runway ahead for customers to continue to adopt a lot of these feature sets that have been released. And our focus is really through customer success as well as sales, making sure that we do a really good job showing for training of value that these new features have. So that will be kind of our biggest focal point for our software sales team over the next few hours moving more and more customers into those offerings and we're certainly confident in our ability to do so.\nPaul Chung: Great. Then on the international front, you saw a very strong growth there, particularly in Europe, where you're seeing pockets of strength there in Europe and where we're seeing the most momentum, and then how the traction been in Asia, you called out that contract there in India; any comments there? Thank you.\nRick Smith: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So those who have been with us a while will recall for a long time, we're really disciplined about proving our international strategy and what we call our tier 1 markets, the UK, Canada and Australia. And we feel like, we've earned the right to expand beyond those markets now and we've hired out really talented teams in several markets around the world. In EMEA specifically, we're seeing exciting growth in the Netherlands, in Italy, in Spain, in Germany, in France. In addition to India, where we look at this first contract with [Indiscernible] kind of the first indicator that our strategy there is working, and we're going to continue to build out a team there across 1 of the largest leasing markets in the world. Another place we're really seeing a lot of success is Brazil, which 3 years or 4 years ago, we were barred from selling into and now, they are again buying both CWs and our video devices. And so we've got to the point now where both our sales team has localized into some of these markets and our product team is doing a fantastic job supporting our customers in those markets to round out the edges and achieve that last mile of product market fit and it's really coming together nicely for our international business.\nAngel Ambrosio: Okay, we are going to go back to Brian Gesuale from Raymond James. Good ahead Brian.\nBrian Gesuale: Yes. Thanks very much. You've had several really large wins here over the course of the year and some big deployments coming up with body cams as well as a lot of investments to make to continue to support that TAM mark opportunity out there. Can you maybe talk about how we might see the margins, having flow over the next couple of quarters as you start to bring those customers live and continue to invest in the business?\nJawad Ahsan : Yes, Brian, thanks for the question. I'll take that. So over the long term, I want to reiterate that we're driving the business towards 30% adjusted EBITDA margins, 70% gross margins. Over the next couple of quarters, I guess the best way to think about it, when we start off year, we have a comprehensive list of investments that we want to make in product and channel, operational excellence, etc., and we set our revenue targets and then determine which of these investments that we're going to fund, as you might imagine, not everything gets above the line. Now, everything gets a green light. As we over-deliver on revenue throughout the year, we unlocked funding for those items that were below the line because we do believe that we want to reinvest back in the business. We've got a tremendous opportunity to get after these new products, segments and channels, and so forth. Had we not had $30 million of revenue pushed into 2022, our adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4, would have stayed roughly flat to where they were at the end of Q3. But because we've been unlocking funding throughout the year for these new initiatives, we're now expecting to finish the year, at the EBITDA levels we've guided to, which translates to roughly 20% adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year. And then for next year, we're going to reset. Now, in 2 things to note here, the first one is that, the new initiatives that we're funding, things like VR training and federal next-generation TASER, body camera, records and dispatch fleet we're super excited about. For all these areas, demand is very strong, and just like we saw in 2021, you're going to see any over delivery fall right to the bottom line, you'll see margin tend to tick up. And the second thing note is that, we are in the budget process right now. We're going to treat 2022 just like we've been treating prior years, which is we're going to make sure -- there are going to be things that are below the line. So the Q4 margin rate, even though it's going to be slightly lower, we're going to view that as an anomaly.\nBrian Gesuale: Great, I appreciate that. And then the ARR that you booked in the quarter, I think sequentially it's about as strong as I can remember. Any specific shoutouts to particular lines of software? I know the VR /AR stuff has been -- had a lot of momentum over the course of the last couple of quarters. How might we think about some of that strength and what it might look like as we carry that momentum into '22?\nJawad Ahsan : Let me take that release to begin with. We're seeing improving the attach rates on our premium services like Respond, which is the live streaming of body cameras. And on our last call, we talked about how Charlottesville used that capability as they were taking down the controversial statues, to able to see world officers were and be able to tap into live video streams. There's also ALPR, of course, in Fleet. And Respond, as part of our new OSP 7+ premium, which is a plan that includes VR and transcription. So I think we're also seeing an improvement in the attach rates in our highest premium plan in addition to those individual elements.\nRick Smith: Yes, that's right. Actually, Brian, just to formalize, it is a record for us. It's the largest single quarter increase we've ever seen in the IR.\nBrian Gesuale: I thought so. Congratulations. I'll jump back in the queue, guys.\nAngel Ambrosio: Okay. Our next question comes from Keith Housum at Northcoast. Good ahead Keith.\nKeith Housum : Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the quarter once again. Appreciate all the color on the TAM and the penetration. As we look at your TASER weapons, they had a phenomenal quarter this quarter, can you provide a little color or context in terms of the percentage of weapons that are being sold as replacement or refresh versus really into new users?\nRick Smith: Thanks a lot for the question, Keith. Nice to see you again. Ultimately for us, I think there's 3 or 4 markets right now that, are adopting TASER. And the answer to your question, is really dependent on the market. For U.S. state in local, ultimately, our motion there is more of an upgrade motion, where folks are -- the majority of the market is upgrading from a Legacy TASER to the new TASER 7. Now, because we sell cameras and tasers in the same bundles now, we are seeing an uptick in that market in terms of first-time standard issue users, which is promising and we don't think can see -- continue to see that being low into the future. And then in other markets like, international and federal and enterprise security, we're seeing more and more first-time TASER users --\nRick Smith: So in international, for example, we have a TASER First strategy where we really want to bet on ourselves to deliver a really fantastic customer experience to a customer we've never worked with before and then they'll adopt our TASERs. And then, 1 year or 2 years later, once we put some equity into the bank there with those customers, we can go back and sell them additional products from our portfolio. And I think federal is a little bit of that as well, and then same with our private security channel. So little bit of a mixed bag depending on the market, but definitely seeing high demand across all of those markets.\nKeith Housum : So if you had to aggregate all the numbers, would it be 70% is going to be refreshed, 30% new? Or is it vice versa? Can you ballpark that for me?\nRick Smith: I don't have it off the top of my head. I have keep them prior -- I want to avoid any estimate until I've got the data in front of me so we can come back to you with something like that in a future quarter.\nKeith Housum : Fair enough, I'll appreciate that. Just as a follow-up on the supply chain, any chance of supply chain issues looks beyond is a dangerous weapons this quarter into body-worn cameras?\nLuke Larson : So I'll take that one Keith, we feel really good about our pipeline. We've been working closely with all of our suppliers. We get to sign contract and committed deliverables into Q1 and Q2. So at this time, in the first half of the year, we feel really confident we're going to We're going to get rid of the backlog on Tasers and keep the momentum going with our full product portfolio. Now, I would add the caveat, we are in the middle of a global supply chain crisis. Our team has done a phenomenal job navigating that, and I think our supply chain strategy has proven that out over the last 2 years, and we feel really good about it.\nKeith Housum : I appreciate. Thank you.\nAngel Ambrosio: Thanks, Keith. Our next question comes from Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum. Go ahead, Jeremy.\nJeremy Hamblin: Him Todd. I'll add my congratulations. Let me first start with a question I think probably for Rick in product development team. So with this ambitious target to make the bullet obsolete by 2030. It's been a few years now since TASER 7. How many iterations of the TASER products do you expect to roll out between now and then in that 8-year period in getting you to that capability where stopping power can match or exceed traditional hand gun?\nRick Smith: So I would say 2 or 3 product revs, between now and 2030 with [Indiscernible]. I don't know we would just to be really specific, I think by 2030 our goal is to outperform the 9 millimeter. And I think that's 2 or 3 product gens out.\nJeremy Hamblin: Okay. And in terms of the investment in your R&D team that, needs to be made to achieve a goal like that. Is that something that, you feel is going to accelerate from what it has been growing at over the last, let's say 4 or 5 years?\nRick Smith: No, not necessarily. The TASER developments are continuing to move along and that business, as it grows, is funding the R&D. I did also, at Accelerate, start to talk about robotics and part of this as well as being able to remove operators from harm's way and some of the most tie risk scenarios and to be able to incapacitate a target. In addition to the handheld Tasers devices, we know our customers also like, if you have a guy in a barricade situation who is armed or I was just talking with a major police chief earlier about incidents like somebody with a gun standing on his porch; you don't want to get within 25 feet of them. And so in those cases, being able to deploy a long range system, and ultimately, I've come to believe that, doing that through some sort of robotic is better than trying to develop some long-range rifle, will be part of the Net solution that it will take for us to cut police shootings in half. We think part that better weapons that, a human can operate themselves. TASER 8, 9, 10. And then also new capabilities, where they might be able to engage particularly dangerous subjects from further distances or even outside of the building.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks. That's actually a good segue and my follow-up question which is, personnel costs, are typically the highest expense for most police departments. This has been an incredibly dynamic 2-year period in law enforcement. vaccine mandates, civil unrest that we've been going through. I just wanted to get a sense for the insight that you are hearing from the police chiefs as to: 1. Staffing with new Patrol Officers, whether they're getting the personnel that they need. 2. The evolution with Axon as a partner, in how to potentially stretch the police force that's deployed in public domains a little bit better or more efficiently so that they can maintain their budgets. What is -- Can you just enlighten us a little bit more about what you're hearing from police chiefs?\nRick Smith: Yeah. I think one of the things we can do to best help them stretch their budget is to free officers from having these fairly expensive professionals spending a lot of time on data entry tasks and a lot of the work that we're doing, for example, in records may not read us directly on obsoleting the bullet, but it can read very directly on helping agencies leverage their staff. I mean, effectively, we could double their productivity if officers didn't have to spend half their day sitting at a laptop, typing up records. And we're doing a lot of work there on the back-office to connect all these sensors we have in the field all the way through, not just into reporting system in an agency, but now moving over into the justice system where you started to talk about how we're finding there's new efficiency needs for prosecutors in courts that are receiving the deluge of digital evidence that we're producing -- that our customers are now producing and handing off and that's creating new and other interesting areas where we can solve a lot of these efficiency problems that translate very directly into budgetary gains.\nJeremy Hamblin: Are they getting adequate staffing or are they having to rely on you even more as a partner? Because in some cases it does sound like staffing has been a challenge to get. I think there's a lot of people who feel like they've been, attacked maybe is an inappropriate word, publicly, and they are not looking to sign up for the job anymore but maybe an opportunity for Axon to again stretch those resources.\nRick Smith: Yeah. We certainly arguing that recruiting is particularly challenging in this environment. I mean, I do think we're also seeing a shift in public sentiment. I mean, in Minneapolis, the bill to replace the police department did not pass. I think we're starting to see a shift in our customers are starting to feel it as well where people are just realizing that law enforcement is a really a critical function and we need to have real solutions and that requires thoughtful investment. Not defunding, but ultimately, as it is more challenging for them to higher than productivity tools do become even more important.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks for the color. Well done. Best wishes.\nRick Smith: Great questions. Thank you.\nAngel Ambrosio: Okay, our next question comes from Eric Stampfel from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Eric.\nEric Stampfel : Hi, team. Thanks. Maybe if we could go back to the adoption you are seeing with Records and Respond. I guess just curious, are customers generally upgrading to those solutions as they're moving to higher value bundles with body camera contracts? Do you see that some customers actually have room in the budget to do that ahead of their existing contracts? Just anything on the cadence of adoption, understand it's still early for most customers.\nRick Smith: Yes. Absolutely Eric. Thanks for the question. And ultimately, we believe our products work best together, right. And we believe that, a digital evidence will be at the heart of every police record. Certainly, we're already seeing that trend and we expect that to only continue and grow in the next 5 to 10 years. And so, right now, most of our customers are buying Records in the same offering -- the OS [Indiscernible] of the officer 's safety plan offering and that strategy is serving us well. Right now, we're doing our best to balance more and more customers signing up for the Records products with nailing the experience for our first adopters. And we're hearing more and more positive sentiment from our early customers in records to attribute to the hard work or product team is doing to deliver that experience. And we really believe that stacking one customer onto the next than just doing that enough times to have a really positive early experience and records is what's going to lead to that significant adoption across the market later, and that's the mission we're focused on for now.\nEric Stampfel : Thank you. And then as we think about consumer and just as you're building out prospects for channels there, do you expect most of that to be in a direct model or are there opportunities to expand into store fronts, I guess just in how we think of the differences of sales model is the consumer opportunity really starts to ramp?\nJawad Ahsan : Thanks Eric. I will take that and maybe turn it over to Rick for some additional color. So today, it's both. Today, we sell through distributors and direct-to-consumers and we certainly plan in the near term to leverage both of those models going forward. We do think there's an opportunity for us to increase direct-to-consumer with some of the products we're developing. It's not only next-generation Taser but we're also in the process of developing mobile applications for personal safety, and those we're going to be going direct.\nEric Stampfel : Thank you.\nJawad Ahsan : I'll just leave it at that. I don't want to telegraph too much what we're doing. We haven't announced in terms of products yet, but we're excited about what's coming.\nRick Smith: Very excited.\nAngel Ambrosio: All right. Our next question comes from Will Power right there. Go ahead, Will.\nWill Power : Okay, great. Yeah, congratulations on strong results. I want to come back to your record, whoever wants to take it. I know you made the comment on the record bookings up 70%. I'd just love to get a little more color on the key drivers of components of that strength as it, is it dominated by any particular products, geographies you think about something between sensors, taser, international building is pretty broad based but any for the back drop on the drivers, that'd be great.\nRick Smith: Let me hand over to Josh. he's just a little closer to the customers in terms of the actual order-flow. I'm feeling broad, general support from the customers. And 1 thing we're hearing is the fact all the stuff works very well together, they see us really being quite valuable. Historically, police tax systems are sort of infamous for not playing well with other systems. Josh, how would you answer that question?\nJosh Isner : Ultimately, our bookings are a combination of several factors. I think in our core segments, the more and more officer safety plan adoption that we see drives bookings up because it is -- those are our highest ASP offerings. Now, in addition to that, we're seeing international grow very quickly and we're really, really excited about that. We had -- we're on track for a record year in international by mid double-digit percentages, that's very encouraging to see. We're also seeing that same growth in some of our newer segments, such as the Justice segment had a record quarter, our Enterprise segment had a rough record quarter with private security sales growing.  And then, of course, new products are also contributing, both Axon Air, which is our drone offering, and VR. VR is our fastest adopted product ever, including the TASER X26. And so, we're seeing just across -- it's the first quarter we've ever had where every single one of our sales teams exceeded their goal in Q3, and we're expecting that type of momentum to contribute -- or to continue across all segments and all products. Very encouraging stuff and I think that, in his comments to start, we expect to even post a better results next quarter in terms of total bookings.\nWill Power : That's great. And then maybe just a question for Jawad, I know you all provided a revenue guidance or a target for next year. Maybe I missed this, but any framework for EBITDA margins for next year? I know you have longer-term 30% on target. I know this year you've largely outperformed where you intended to be, you've got investments planned, there were some of the puts and takes we should think about as we put our models together for next year to be in the right sim code.\nJawad Ahsan : Yes, I appreciate the question, Will, you certainly nailed the party line. We are driving towards 30% margins long term and we're going to remain opportunistic about where to invest weeks are in the process of setting our budget for 2022. We have not formerly guided to EBITDA dollars or margin for next year the way that we're thinking about it is, as I mentioned, we have a host of investments that we'd like to fund. Not everything is going to get funded and as we go throughout the year and hopefully surpass our revenue targets, we're going to unlock more funding. The reason we're doing that is there's just so much opportunity in front of us and it's across a variety of categories. It's cross multiple products, multiple channels, multiple geographies, and I want to make sure that we're keeping our top-line growing and the way we do that is by investing, right? And not focusing on EBITDA. So, what you can count on from us is we're going to stay disciplined, that's something that Rick and I rest the executive team are very much aligned on. That we want to drive leverage in the business overtime but we also are going to prioritize investing in getting after this TAM that we shared with you today.\nWill Power : Thank you.\nAngel Ambrosio: Okay. And I think that's everybody, unless there are any follow-up questions. No? All right. Rick, over to you to close us out.\nRick Smith: Okay. Well, again, thanks everybody for joining us and we look forward to updating you as we bring the year to a close next quarter. And I do want to close out by sharing a powerful moment that we shared with our customers at Accelerate where we missed having our investors this year. We celebrated their sacrifice these past few years through the pandemic and widespread social challenges so with that, let's share the moment. Please stay on, folks, don't run to your next call. Take a moment to share this with us. Your investments make this possible.",

            "name": "Jawad Ahsan",
            "content": "Thanks, Luke. I also want to start by echoing the excitement over our Accelerate conference. Meeting with our customers, partners, and employees from around the world was super energizing. It reinforced for me that Axon sits squarely at the intersection of social justice and advanced technology with a mission that galvanizes all of our stakeholders. These stakeholders include you, our investors. While we weren't able to offer an investor track at Accelerate this year, you've been top of mind for us. In light of feedback we received at our last proxy, we've been conducting a listening campaign to gather more specific feedback from our investors on our approach to governance in ESG. The input we've received has been invaluable and we look forward to sharing the outcome of these discussions in the coming months. Now, over the past several years, you've seen us invest aggressively in R&D and channel expansion. We've deployed capital to strategic partnerships, putting an early stake in the ground on emerging technologies and trends. These actions have enabled us to unlock transformative new products like VR and Respond new customer market segments like Federal and Justice, and new geographic regions worldwide. Today, we're excited to share that as a result of our strategic planning and continued investments, we're projecting substantial runway for growth with a new and updated Total Addressable Market or TAM. Our new TAM is almost double the last one that we shared with you. While our penetration in this new TAM is still relatively low, it's absolutely our intention to serve these markets with the investments we have in place, which will see us bring exciting new products to market over the next 18 to 24 months. There are two areas in particular I want to highlight. First, federal, we had Richard Coleman to run our federal business in 2018, and he has since built a stellar team who's performance has exceeded our expectations. We now view the federal team for Axon as a $9 billion opportunity across taser devices, body-worn cameras, demos, and other software. We count among our customers today, several of the branches of the federal government, including the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and the Drug Enforcement Agency. We've also been driving adoption of our new multi-jurisdictional sharing feature, which is enabling state and local agencies to seamlessly share evidence with U.S. attorneys. To better serve federal customers who have sensitive law enforcement information, We've made an investment to ensure our software complies with the Civilian Fed Rate High and the Defense Impact Level 5 security standards. At these security levels, we anticipate being able to offer a DEM solution to all 90+ federal law enforcement organization s across civilian and defense agencies. After a strong third quarter in which we added $35 million in new deals, we are on track to have another record year for federal bookings. Next, I want to briefly double-click on consumer. Axon has, since its inception, always had a consumer business, but it's historically not been one that we've devoted meaningful R&D to. With the ongoing development of our exciting new TASER device technology, we've committed to releasing a host of new personal safety devices over the next few years that will help advance our mission to truly obsolete the bullet. We also intend to begin offering personal safety solutions to mobile applications over this time frame. In our shareholder letter, we highlighted a TASER device penetration is less than 25% in the U.S. and even lower globally, but that represents the professional user. The penetration in consumer is virtually 0 in an $11 billion market, which means we have a tremendous runway ahead in just a segment alone. To be clear, we're still very early announcing consumer, but we have the alignment, the technology, the strategy, and most importantly, the mission to drive this growth. Now, before we open up the call to questions, I want to highlight 3 themes that we'd like you to take away this quarter. 1, we are significantly underpenetrated on our growing global TAM. 2, we're delivering against the rule of 40, investing for growth while achieving leverage. 3. Our year-to-date results and outlook for 2022 are a waypoint in towards building a much larger Company that is synonymous with public safety and protecting life. As we look ahead to 2022, we're carrying a ton of momentum into the new year. Our 2022 revenue projection has strengthened to at least $1 billion on top of what we expect will be at least 25% year-over-year growth in 2021. We added a record $28 million in ARR this past quarter to bring our total ARR to $288 million. We have an exciting runway ahead of us, and we look forward to sharing updates on our progress in the coming quarters. With that, Angel, let's move to questions. Then Josh, the question on gross margins, we're not expecting at this point any impact from Fleet on gross margins. Yes, I'll start with that 1, John, and thanks for the question. So, we've been, as we talked about for the past few years, investing for growth beyond the TASER devices and body cameras, and we've given you flavors here and there of the markets that we're aiming towards the new products and segments. And what we wanted to do is reflect accurately how the business is oriented today. Our TAM has been expanding in the past few years, but that's also because the lens that we're looking at our business through has been widening as well, and things like VR, a bigger presence in federal, more of a focus on consumer; these investments are in-flight now, as I mentioned they're still very, very early inning s but its TAM release speaks more to our ambition. We wanted to align how we're thinking about our TAM opportunity with how we're investing for growth today. And we wanted to make sure that you guys are thinking about the same way that we are. Yes, the great thing about it is it's not a lot of incremental investment. The beauty of Axon business today is that the technology we have for TASER, for example, right? We've been investing in TASER for quite some time. We've talked a lot about the next-generation TASER technology, we're very excited about. And that technology is going to be able to serve our domestic and international law enforcement markets, it's going to be able to serve our federal markets, correction, enterprise security; it's going to, in a large way be able to translate to consumer as well. And so what we're really looking to do is gain leverage on the investments that we're already making. The same thing holds true with body camera and DEMS. You look at the body camera and DEMS product, it's really an enterprise solution that happens to be oriented towards law enforcement today and is geared towards law enforcement. We think that there are other use cases for that technology, and there are new areas like VR training that we are making a new incremental investment. In that content, there the demand is extremely strong. And in drones, here, we're looking to partner a little bit more and find the right partners to help us get into those markets. But what you should read into this is that we're not looking to really expand or to get too far ahead of our skis as far as investments into new technologies that's really driving leverage from the one that we have. Yes, Brian, thanks for the question. I'll take that. So over the long term, I want to reiterate that we're driving the business towards 30% adjusted EBITDA margins, 70% gross margins. Over the next couple of quarters, I guess the best way to think about it, when we start off year, we have a comprehensive list of investments that we want to make in product and channel, operational excellence, etc., and we set our revenue targets and then determine which of these investments that we're going to fund, as you might imagine, not everything gets above the line. Now, everything gets a green light. As we over-deliver on revenue throughout the year, we unlocked funding for those items that were below the line because we do believe that we want to reinvest back in the business. We've got a tremendous opportunity to get after these new products, segments and channels, and so forth. Had we not had $30 million of revenue pushed into 2022, our adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4, would have stayed roughly flat to where they were at the end of Q3. But because we've been unlocking funding throughout the year for these new initiatives, we're now expecting to finish the year, at the EBITDA levels we've guided to, which translates to roughly 20% adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year. And then for next year, we're going to reset. Now, in 2 things to note here, the first one is that, the new initiatives that we're funding, things like VR training and federal next-generation TASER, body camera, records and dispatch fleet we're super excited about. For all these areas, demand is very strong, and just like we saw in 2021, you're going to see any over delivery fall right to the bottom line, you'll see margin tend to tick up. And the second thing note is that, we are in the budget process right now. We're going to treat 2022 just like we've been treating prior years, which is we're going to make sure -- there are going to be things that are below the line. So the Q4 margin rate, even though it's going to be slightly lower, we're going to view that as an anomaly. Let me take that release to begin with. We're seeing improving the attach rates on our premium services like Respond, which is the live streaming of body cameras. And on our last call, we talked about how Charlottesville used that capability as they were taking down the controversial statues, to able to see world officers were and be able to tap into live video streams. There's also ALPR, of course, in Fleet. And Respond, as part of our new OSP 7+ premium, which is a plan that includes VR and transcription. So I think we're also seeing an improvement in the attach rates in our highest premium plan in addition to those individual elements. Thanks Eric. I will take that and maybe turn it over to Rick for some additional color. So today, it's both. Today, we sell through distributors and direct-to-consumers and we certainly plan in the near term to leverage both of those models going forward. We do think there's an opportunity for us to increase direct-to-consumer with some of the products we're developing. It's not only next-generation Taser but we're also in the process of developing mobile applications for personal safety, and those we're going to be going direct. I'll just leave it at that. I don't want to telegraph too much what we're doing. We haven't announced in terms of products yet, but we're excited about what's coming. Yes, I appreciate the question, Will, you certainly nailed the party line. We are driving towards 30% margins long term and we're going to remain opportunistic about where to invest weeks are in the process of setting our budget for 2022. We have not formerly guided to EBITDA dollars or margin for next year the way that we're thinking about it is, as I mentioned, we have a host of investments that we'd like to fund. Not everything is going to get funded and as we go throughout the year and hopefully surpass our revenue targets, we're going to unlock more funding. The reason we're doing that is there's just so much opportunity in front of us and it's across a variety of categories. It's cross multiple products, multiple channels, multiple geographies, and I want to make sure that we're keeping our top-line growing and the way we do that is by investing, right?

            "content": "Thanks, Rick. Let me start by echoing your sentiment around Accelerate. We believe it all starts with creating a great experience for the customer, which means more than just listening. It's anticipating their needs by mapping technologies to insightful opportunities. A level of customer engagement we saw this year is a testament to the transformative power of the public safety platform we build. We're obsessed with creating value in a unique way that no one else can by solving real problems with solutions people are willing to use. Who is a phenomenal week learning from customers from all over the world I could not be more excited for the road ahead. Huge shout out to our marketing sales product teams and really all the employees that are icon and made such an impact on experience. The business continues to grow at a fast pace, which means recruiting and fostering the best and most diverse talent is critical to our success. Our ability to retain top talent not only allows Axon to move increasingly closer to accomplishing our mission, but also allows us to establish new goals along the way. To do this, we need to continue creating an organization that is future-proof, resilient to disruption, and at the forefront of innovation. We are currently hiring over 300 roles and we have embraced remote work as an opportunity to expand our talent pool, pooling from the best-in-class resources around the globe. How our employees spend their lives matter, which is why we put a great deal of consideration into the culture we are creating and the values we want to embody as we build the future. This means we're doubling down on our Jet-I and learning development initiatives. The teams we built, our unparalleled and it's incredible watching the collective hard work and dedication to our mission. We're laser-focused on how do we attract, retain, and develop the best talent. You know someone great that wants to make a great impact, send them our way. As we round out the year, we feel great about our product pipeline. We're finishing 2021 with exceptional bookings, which includes $30 million of TASER 7 revenue that we expected to deliver in Q4, but it's now just shifting into the first half of 2022. This is the result of an industry-wide chip shortage that impacted our TASER 7 platform. The supply chain conversation is universal right now, and while we are not immune, our teams are definitely navigating the situation. We have incredibly strong relationships and a long history with our supply chain partners who are invested in Axon's mission and are aligned in helping us meet our pipeline. Teamwork is harder than it seems on the surface and as our Company's skilled globally, it requires a consistent commitment to operate as 1 team. We're proud of our supply chain team to have done a tremendous job helping us manage through the global supply chain prices. While we've experienced some delays and the potential for interruption remains, we have line of sight to clearance in the first half of 2022 and continue to be confident in our ability to meet the needs of our customers and deliver on our annual revenue guidance, in spite of these challenges. I want to reiterate, we have line of sight to clearing the backlog in the first half of the year. We feel great about our pipeline and hoping to what continues to be a dynamic environment. Now, I will turn the call over to Axon's Chief Financial Officer, Jawad. So I'll take that one Keith, we feel really good about our pipeline. We've been working closely with all of our suppliers. We get to sign contract and committed deliverables into Q1 and Q2. So at this time, in the first half of the year, we feel really confident we're going to We're going to get rid of the backlog on Tasers and keep the momentum going with our full product portfolio. Now, I would add the caveat, we are in the middle of a global supply chain crisis. Our team has done a phenomenal job navigating that, and I think our supply chain strategy has proven that out over the last 2 years, and we feel really good about it."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "All right. Great job, Angel and Andrea and our whole IR team. You guys just really did a nice job on that video. I hope our investors enjoyed it. So as you can see from our results, our teams are continuing to execute at the highest level. Perhaps the strongest growth indicator is record bookings of $0.5 billion in a single quarter. As bookings eventually flow through to revenue, Axon has become a substantially larger business in the coming years. And the momentum is really strong, with sales contracts booked up to 70% year-to-date compared to last year, and we expect another record bookings quarter in Q4. I'm proud of the results we're delivering in 2021 and even more energized by the opportunity in front of us. We've demonstrated our ability to scale the business and drive leverage in our model. Now, we're expanding our growth story as we continue to introduce new products, selling to new customer market segments and ad sales channels across geographies. Today, we're addressing an even larger TAM. As you saw in the video, our current estimates point to a total addressable market of $52 billion. With our top-line projected to reach at least $1 billion next year, you can see there's enormous white space that had. By way of example, in early October AXON had its largest ever presence at the Association of the United States Army's Annual Conference in Washington, DC. This provided us with an opportunity to showcase our AXON transformative solutions for law enforcement position us to disrupt the U.S. defense market, giving us a seat at the table to begin influencing how the military responds towards to the future. As I watched the helicopters evacuate our embassy in Kabul, it struck me that the United States has effectively not achieved durable, strategic success in our last 3 wars. And it's not for lack of sufficient lethality. Our military is the greatest fighting machine in the history of the world, with the most lethal and precise weapons. Yet, the more we killed in Vietnam, the more we lost the hearts and minds of the very people we needed to win over. And the same phenomenon played out in Iraq and Afghanistan. We can no longer kill our way to success in modern conflicts. And I believe the ability to capture bad actors will become ever more strategically valuable, and we intend to lead the way. As the world news is at a faster pace, Axon is remaining at the forefront of bringing transformative technologies to market. We're innovators at our core. You can see that when you look at our history. We signed the incorporation papers for TASER at my dining room table 28 years ago. And since that time our mission has remained unchanged, but our organization has significantly evolved. And today, we have a broad ecosystem of public safety products. We have continually found new ways to serve our customers from disruptive technologies and software, even when they met with initial resistance. We've always said extremely high bars for ourselves at Axon but we found that great challenges make us rise to meet them. Earlier this month, we held our 6th Annual Axon Accelerate Conference right here in Phoenix, and it sure felt great to be back in person with all our customers and colleagues. The theme of this year's conference, and the topic of my opening keynote, was that change is inevitable and today, technology is moving at an exponential pace. From virtual reality training to our drone program, Axon Air, to automatic license plate reader technology and transcription, we're unlocking the power of technology to reach our North Star of obsoleting the bullet and outperforming the 9-millimeter pistol and stopping power by 2030. Amid Accelerate, we introduced our next moonshot. Together with our customers in public safety, within the next 10 years, we aim to cut officer-involved shootings by half. We believe we can accomplish this with new technologies, new training procedures, new policies, and even new regulations to guide the way. In fact, I used to accelerate as an opportunity to introduce a regulatory framework. The 3 Laws of first respond to robotics to begin a critically important discussion of how we use robotics, not to kill each other, but specifically to avoid harming each other, with new ways to capture dangerous subjects. Any decision that impacts the human subject for robot must be made by an authenticated human operator accepting legal and moreover responsibility. That are first proposed law, second, there should be no lethal force. De -escalation should be the primary goal in the minimal use of force to stop a threat. And then the 3rd is that any institute of force deployed by a robotic system should be recorded in full audio video in all user data and reviewed by an independent oversight committee. I will be hosting a Reddit AMA in December to gather public input on these guidelines. We're proud of our history of increasing mechanisms of control and accountability to ensure that powerful new technologies are used for good from the data logs and the TASER to the very existence of body cameras and our ethical product framework that we use to guide our ALPR development. And now we are leading the way to set the regulatory framework years ahead of advanced non-lethal robotics technology. We're excited to continue to blaze new trails in our mission to end killing. We were fortunate to close out 3 days of robust, interactive dialogue at Accelerate with a keynote where I got to interview Former President George W. Bush. He delivered an incredibly inspiring talk, expressing gratitude to public safety officers and calling for civility to all citizens, which is squarely aligned with our mission to protect life, capture truth, and accelerate justice. And at the end of today's call, we're going to play for you a very powerful moment from Accelerate, so please stay tuned after the Q&A. And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Luke Larson, our President. Thanks a lot for the question, Josh. I think at this point, we do see it hitting in both Q1 and Q2. And certainly, it's a challenging supply chain environment across the world right now and the team's doing a great job navigating through that. And so, of course, we're hoping we can fulfill as much of that in Q1 as we can, but realistically it'll be across Q1 and Q2. I let Jawad answer the second part of that question. But on Fleet 3, the demand has been very, very high, higher than we've ever seen for our in-car video products before. So we are shipping a record numbers of Fleet 3 as compared to Fleet 1 and Fleet 2 and we expect that to continue throughout next year. We are oversubscribed for the product right now and I think that speaks more towards the demand than anything else but we do expect to shift large quantities relative to previous versions in Q1 and moving forward, I'm sorry the Q4 of this year and moving forward and Q1. Paul, thanks for the question. I think the good news here is that the product team has done a fantastic job delivering several value-added feature sets over the last couple of years. And we're now seeing the market really start to value those. One of those is performance which measures how officers are complying with their agency policy. There's updated redaction tools, there's a product called Standards, which is our first module of our records products. And ultimately, as we bundle the solutions together in our officer safety plan offerings, we're seeing more and more customers buy those offerings. In fact, we've seen about double the number of licenses purchased this year, so far on that plan as last year and we only achieved through the year. The 2 to 3 quarters, I'd say so. There's a lot of runway ahead for customers to continue to adopt a lot of these feature sets that have been released. And our focus is really through customer success as well as sales, making sure that we do a really good job showing for training of value that these new features have. So that will be kind of our biggest focal point for our software sales team over the next few hours moving more and more customers into those offerings and we're certainly confident in our ability to do so. Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So those who have been with us a while will recall for a long time, we're really disciplined about proving our international strategy and what we call our tier 1 markets, the UK, Canada and Australia. And we feel like, we've earned the right to expand beyond those markets now and we've hired out really talented teams in several markets around the world. In EMEA specifically, we're seeing exciting growth in the Netherlands, in Italy, in Spain, in Germany, in France. In addition to India, where we look at this first contract with [Indiscernible] kind of the first indicator that our strategy there is working, and we're going to continue to build out a team there across 1 of the largest leasing markets in the world. Another place we're really seeing a lot of success is Brazil, which 3 years or 4 years ago, we were barred from selling into and now, they are again buying both CWs and our video devices. And so we've got to the point now where both our sales team has localized into some of these markets and our product team is doing a fantastic job supporting our customers in those markets to round out the edges and achieve that last mile of product market fit and it's really coming together nicely for our international business. Yes, that's right. Actually, Brian, just to formalize, it is a record for us. It's the largest single quarter increase we've ever seen in the IR. Thanks a lot for the question, Keith. Nice to see you again. Ultimately for us, I think there's 3 or 4 markets right now that, are adopting TASER. And the answer to your question, is really dependent on the market. For U.S. state in local, ultimately, our motion there is more of an upgrade motion, where folks are -- the majority of the market is upgrading from a Legacy TASER to the new TASER 7. Now, because we sell cameras and tasers in the same bundles now, we are seeing an uptick in that market in terms of first-time standard issue users, which is promising and we don't think can see -- continue to see that being low into the future. And then in other markets like, international and federal and enterprise security, we're seeing more and more first-time TASER users -- So in international, for example, we have a TASER First strategy where we really want to bet on ourselves to deliver a really fantastic customer experience to a customer we've never worked with before and then they'll adopt our TASERs. And then, 1 year or 2 years later, once we put some equity into the bank there with those customers, we can go back and sell them additional products from our portfolio. And I think federal is a little bit of that as well, and then same with our private security channel. So little bit of a mixed bag depending on the market, but definitely seeing high demand across all of those markets. I don't have it off the top of my head. I have keep them prior -- I want to avoid any estimate until I've got the data in front of me so we can come back to you with something like that in a future quarter. So I would say 2 or 3 product revs, between now and 2030 with [Indiscernible]. I don't know we would just to be really specific, I think by 2030 our goal is to outperform the 9 millimeter. And I think that's 2 or 3 product gens out. No, not necessarily. The TASER developments are continuing to move along and that business, as it grows, is funding the R&D. I did also, at Accelerate, start to talk about robotics and part of this as well as being able to remove operators from harm's way and some of the most tie risk scenarios and to be able to incapacitate a target. In addition to the handheld Tasers devices, we know our customers also like, if you have a guy in a barricade situation who is armed or I was just talking with a major police chief earlier about incidents like somebody with a gun standing on his porch; you don't want to get within 25 feet of them. And so in those cases, being able to deploy a long range system, and ultimately, I've come to believe that, doing that through some sort of robotic is better than trying to develop some long-range rifle, will be part of the Net solution that it will take for us to cut police shootings in half. We think part that better weapons that, a human can operate themselves. TASER 8, 9, 10. And then also new capabilities, where they might be able to engage particularly dangerous subjects from further distances or even outside of the building. Yeah. I think one of the things we can do to best help them stretch their budget is to free officers from having these fairly expensive professionals spending a lot of time on data entry tasks and a lot of the work that we're doing, for example, in records may not read us directly on obsoleting the bullet, but it can read very directly on helping agencies leverage their staff. I mean, effectively, we could double their productivity if officers didn't have to spend half their day sitting at a laptop, typing up records. And we're doing a lot of work there on the back-office to connect all these sensors we have in the field all the way through, not just into reporting system in an agency, but now moving over into the justice system where you started to talk about how we're finding there's new efficiency needs for prosecutors in courts that are receiving the deluge of digital evidence that we're producing -- that our customers are now producing and handing off and that's creating new and other interesting areas where we can solve a lot of these efficiency problems that translate very directly into budgetary gains. Yeah. We certainly arguing that recruiting is particularly challenging in this environment. I mean, I do think we're also seeing a shift in public sentiment. I mean, in Minneapolis, the bill to replace the police department did not pass. I think we're starting to see a shift in our customers are starting to feel it as well where people are just realizing that law enforcement is a really a critical function and we need to have real solutions and that requires thoughtful investment. Not defunding, but ultimately, as it is more challenging for them to higher than productivity tools do become even more important. Great questions. Thank you. Yes. Absolutely Eric. Thanks for the question. And ultimately, we believe our products work best together, right. And we believe that, a digital evidence will be at the heart of every police record. Certainly, we're already seeing that trend and we expect that to only continue and grow in the next 5 to 10 years. And so, right now, most of our customers are buying Records in the same offering -- the OS [Indiscernible] of the officer 's safety plan offering and that strategy is serving us well. Right now, we're doing our best to balance more and more customers signing up for the Records products with nailing the experience for our first adopters. And we're hearing more and more positive sentiment from our early customers in records to attribute to the hard work or product team is doing to deliver that experience. And we really believe that stacking one customer onto the next than just doing that enough times to have a really positive early experience and records is what's going to lead to that significant adoption across the market later, and that's the mission we're focused on for now. Very excited. Let me hand over to Josh. he's just a little closer to the customers in terms of the actual order-flow. I'm feeling broad, general support from the customers. And 1 thing we're hearing is the fact all the stuff works very well together, they see us really being quite valuable. Historically, police tax systems are sort of infamous for not playing well with other systems. Josh, how would you answer that question? Okay. Well, again, thanks everybody for joining us and we look forward to updating you as we bring the year to a close next quarter. And I do want to close out by sharing a powerful moment that we shared with our customers at Accelerate where we missed having our investors this year. We celebrated their sacrifice these past few years through the pandemic and widespread social challenges so with that, let's share the moment. Please stay on, folks, don't run to your next call. Take a moment to share this with us. Your investments make this possible."

            "content": "Ultimately, our bookings are a combination of several factors. I think in our core segments, the more and more officer safety plan adoption that we see drives bookings up because it is -- those are our highest ASP offerings. Now, in addition to that, we're seeing international grow very quickly and we're really, really excited about that. We had -- we're on track for a record year in international by mid double-digit percentages, that's very encouraging to see. We're also seeing that same growth in some of our newer segments, such as the Justice segment had a record quarter, our Enterprise segment had a rough record quarter with private security sales growing.  And then, of course, new products are also contributing, both Axon Air, which is our drone offering, and VR. VR is our fastest adopted product ever, including the TASER X26. And so, we're seeing just across -- it's the first quarter we've ever had where every single one of our sales teams exceeded their goal in Q3, and we're expecting that type of momentum to contribute -- or to continue across all segments and all products. Very encouraging stuff and I think that, in his comments to start, we expect to even post a better results next quarter in terms of total bookings."

        "content": "Rick Smith: All right. Great job on the video, Andrea. And folks, I'm giving for Andrea a heart-attack today; I was supposed to be safely in my home office connected to the internet, but I've been out all day, with most of the summer doing customer demos. I'm in the fleet three demo vehicle, and we had a bunch of great meetings today. In fact, we're going to do this live without a net, I am going to do a quick screen share and show you what we're seeing live from the fleet vehicle here; hang on a second. All right, so as you can see there, hey, Garrett wave; in the backseat, we have our prisoner transport area, that's Garrett Langley, the CEO of Flock Safety, an incredible partner of ours, they do -- they are all here with another customers. They've told us today about a number of crimes they've already solved, thanks to Flock cameras. And then we do the mobile; so it's [indiscernible] has been a great investment for us, and really brings powerful capability through partnership; you'll see on the upper left there is a wide angle camera, and then on the right is our high resolution 4K camera that we use for the license plate reading, gives us great resolution at closing speeds of upto 140 miles an hour. Yes, we've got our Product Manager here as well. I'll show you -- here is an example of a plate read; this is from -- just a sample list we use not from criminal data; so this is just a sample we did earlier today. And you'll see -- this will pop an alert; the officer can then check and make sure that it's got it correct, they can go in and they can do things like categorize their existing videos, whether it's the in-car body cameras, etcetera. It's a really intuitive simple user interface, and we're getting fantastic customer reviews. All right, so with that -- I have been traveling a lot seeing our customers which has been great. We've also been encouraged to see this summer at The National Conversation Ramp; policing is evolving to reflect what we've known all along, i.e. police reform and progress bars investment, and focused attention from our best and brightest minds. We're obviously pumped about our quarterly performance, and I couldn't be prouder of how our team is executing and it's translating into growth that we've sustained now over the last few years, and we intend to keep doing it. I'm also proud of our product development team. They have been working really hard as we've invested to build these transformative capabilities. In the fleet three, which I just demoed right here; we're able to bring artificial intelligence, to bring ALPR to every car. Within 90 days of launch, we've already been done deploying 550 vehicles at Pinellas County [ph], and to my awareness, I -- as far as I know, that's the largest ALPR in the country, and it's happening literally within weeks our product launch. And we're already late stage negotiations with another major city to deploy over 1,500 license plate readers, more than doubling what we're doing right now, tech analysis. So you all know, you know, you shouldn't text and drive; those who are doing this all the time they're typing in license plates while they're driving, or they've got to read it in over the radio. Fleet Street [ph] does that for them at a dramatically lower price point, allowing them to deploy this to every car making driving safer, and reducing crime. We've already had customers just in the first few weeks catching serious offenders and finding missing children. On another front our Axon evidence software continues to grow well beyond simply being a backend for our cameras. We want highly competitive digital evidence program in EMEA with an EMEA government encompassing the management of all digital evidence, independent of body camera programs; and this builds on to similar success we've had in Canada and paves the way for us to continue to lead with our software solutions. We feel really well positioned for the back half of the year and beyond as we see traction beyond core, U.S. municipal law enforcement moving into counties and state patrols, federal government and private enterprises. International revenue grew 60% in Q2 and international bookings, which are our forward looking indicator nearly tripled. So in some my part, at Axon, we're excited, we're leading the way in creating a work environment where employees can maximize their happiness and productivity. We offer remote hybrid options; you can work from the office, you can work from your home, you can work from your car; I'm showing you today even on the earnings call. So, we're focused on doing whatever it takes to get the best top tier talent, keep them focused, keep them rested, keep them happy, keep them energized, keep them creative and that's how you get great products and breakout capabilities. So our leadership is now supported by an exceptional workforce that is almost 2,000 people and that's what is going to help drive us to long-term profitable growth; this continuing to build and maintain and groom a fantastic team. And with that, let me turn over to the President of the Company, Luke Larson.\nLuke Larson: Thanks, Rick. The business is firing on all cylinders and we are focused on sustaining momentum. Operationally, we're doing really well, even in the face of global supply chain risk. The reality of the current macro situation is well documented, from geopolitical factors to semiconductor and resin shortages, to logistics, import stoppages are the continued impact of COVID. There's never been a more complex time to make electronics, we have risen to the challenge, and we monitor conditions daily and have put risk mitigation strategies in place that are supporting a rapid growth. While these headwinds persist, our teams are definitely navigating and effectively positioning the business to continue to meet our increasing demand pipeline. In fact, our teams are delivering Olympic level execution on behalf of all of our stakeholders, most notably our customers and our shareholders. Another area where you will see this is our teaser segment gross margins, which are up 500 basis points over last year, as we sell into strong demand; we have engineered costs out of our building materials, and the effects of that continued into this quarter. As you saw in our video and read in our letter, we are ecstatic about the fleet 3 launch and that it's shipping; and we're getting ecstatic reviews from our early customers, as Rick mentioned earlier. And we believe we're just getting started with virtual reality training, with booking nearing $8 million in the first six months, up less than $1 million in the first six months of last year. You've heard me talk about virtual reality on the last several earnings calls, and we're pleased of the demand that we're seeing, and that validates our excitement. We're looking forward to a strong back half of the year and continued momentum into 2022. And with that, let me turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jawad Ahsan.\nJawad Ahsan: Thanks, Luke. The results we're sharing with you today reflect the straightforward and consistent nature of our strategy, which is threefold; execute in the near term in a focused and disciplined way, identify and invest in future areas of growth, and then finally, reinvest the upside from our strong top line performance back into the business to accelerate that growth. We believe that the goals we're working towards are profound, and that our success will be measured by metrics such as the number of lives saved and the level of transparency in the justice system. This is why last quarter, we invited you to look at our business the same way that we look at it; with a long term view. It's why we move to giving two-year annual guidance, because we're thinking about in building the business for the long-term. As you saw in our shareholder letter; today, we are raising our outlook for both fiscal year's 2021 and 2022, which reflects our confidence in our growing global demand. We now expect to deliver between $825 million to $850 million in revenues in 2021, and $960 million in revenues in 2022. We're also pleased with how our investments are seeing traction on three fronts; in international sales channels with new products in a new non-municipal law enforcement markets. Rick highlighted the international strength; now, I'd like to touch upon the traction we're seeing in these latter two categories: new products and new markets. New product bookings are up more than 100% year-over-year. We like looking at bookings as if they forward looking indicator as Rick mentioned, and we typically signed contracts with an average five-year life. These products are largely fast centric and are helping drive our net dollar retention of 119%. They're the result of more recent R&D and include software products, such as records, in standards, respond, VR, citizen, performance, transcription, Axon Air and others. We're also expanding outside of law enforcement into new markets, including federal, enterprise security, consumer and fire & EMS. Bookings in these new markets doubled year-over-year and we see substantial runway for expansion. We focused a lot on financial discipline, which means balancing investing for growth while also demonstrating leverage. This is an area where we feel a strong sense of accountability. So I'm pleased to point out that Q2 adjusted EBITDA grew at 83% year-over-year, and we were able to do that while investing to scale into a broader global profile. Finally, I wanted to highlight that I'm not only proud of how the business is executing, but also of the corporate strategy capability that we've built, where we're partnering with and investing in other innovators and thought leaders in our space. Our recent partnerships and investments are reflective of our vision for the Axon brand to become synonymous with public safety. And equally important, allow us to leverage and expand our platform in a transformative way. To build a public safety ecosystem of the future, we're aligning with other innovators and technology disruptors. For example, our expanding ecosystem relationships with Celebrate and Rapid SOS were driven by our focus on customers and their growing needs for digital evidence management and real-time operations. Our strategic investments in companies, such as Flock Safety, have done well and even more importantly, supported our fleet three go-to-market by allowing us to bundle and co sell our solutions, which you can literally see on display today. Our partnership with Skydio makes their drones in autonomy software solutions available to agencies through AXON. It also paves the way for the integration of Skydio's offerings with AXON product suite, giving customers groundbreaking evidence management, real-time situational awareness, and scene reconstruction capabilities. We take our role as capital stewards very seriously and I'm thrilled to share these exciting updates that demonstrate how our investments are creating real value for the company, our customers, and our shareholders. With that, Andrea, let's move to questions.\nAndrea James: Thank you, Jawad and team. Moderators, can we pull everybody into the gallery view, please? We're all in the gallery view, so everyone is on camera. Just remember that. We'll take our first question from Jonathan Ho at William Blair. Go ahead, Jonathan. You are up.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results. I just wanted to start out with some of the comments around supply chain and whether you're seeing any specific impact on product lines and what some of the mitigations, you mentioned, are that you've put into place around supply chain?\nRick Smith: Great question. Supply chain constraints are a reality for every manufacturer, as we all know. We're managing through it because a lot of intention internally, specifically for me and my teams that as we work to mitigate that risk. Some of the things that we've done to mitigate risk is we've bought out and we bought in advance and beefed up our supply chain and our guiding factors is in the reality. Even with the supply chain constraints, we still feel really strong about the guidance that we put out earlier.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. Then just in terms of a follow-up, can you give us a little bit more color on how you're reaching some of the newer markets, like federal enterprise and non-traditional customer types? Maybe if you can give us a sense of what could drive faster adoption in these markets? That'd be great as well, thank you.\nRick Smith: Thanks for the question, Jonathan, nice to see you again. For us, it's really about focusing on building the right teams to enter these markets and we've talked about in the past on our federal team as well as Mike Shore on our enterprise security team and a lot of folks around the business that are opening up new segments for us. It's really just putting in the work. There's no shortcut to that and we're building stronger relationships. We're identifying stakeholders early in the federal space, we're identifying opportunities within the budget cycles within congress to fund some future projects. I think the team is just executing really well across all of those fronts. So very, very excited for what the future holds for our newer markets.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nAndrea James: Great. All of our analysts, we have you in our queue already. So, you're good. We were going to assume you're going to ask a question and if you're not, that's fine. Scott Bird from Needham. We'll have you up next. Go ahead, Scott.\nScott Bird: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a fantastic quarter. I guess lots of questions will set on one here international. You all highlighted international extensively in your prescriptive remarks. How should we think about that opportunity unfolding maybe from a product perspective over the next one to two years? TASER sales look good, camera sales generally look good. Are all of the markets facing big massive opportunities or is it really going to be led by one or the other over the near or intermediate term?\nRick Smith: I think there's opportunity across the across the globe, Scott. Three or four years ago, when we started really explaining how we're thinking of going to market, we focused on three individual markets UK, Australia, and Canada and all of those continue to perform really well. What we're seeing in those markets is there's wider adoption of our product line. So, body cams, TASERs, and new developments [indiscernible] without body cams, meaning managing other types of digital evidence that are not generated by body cameras. Of course, longer term, we're excited about things like -- in interview room and in records and so forth. So, in those tier-one markets, they continue to lead the way as we expand our product portfolio. Then there's growing opportunity in tier two and tier three markets just on TASERs and body cameras. The cloud is not a great fit everywhere across the world right now. So, in markets like that, we're really focusing more on the TASER side and building an install base that we can go back to later and sell body cameras in the cloud and it's working out. We're seeing TASER orders in very large volumes. We expect that to continue. It's not necessarily something that will happen every quarter, but every year for sure. We're really encouraged by just the growth in both in APAC, EMEA, and the Americas. So, very excited to see international continuing to grow. A lot of people put a lot of hard work into it and we have plenty of runway left in front of us.\nScott Bird: Awesome, if I might, as a quick follow-up to that, Josh, is Axon [ph] body cameras. What's the reception been like for the LTE connectivity on the AV Threes internationally? Obviously, the reception I think has been generally positive here, quite positive. We have the same opportunity to see sales there or just didn't know if their infrastructure is set up the same way as our [indiscernible]?\nJosh Isner: Absolutely, it's got better than expected is the short answer to that one. We're seeing markets, but we do not necessarily think about our plan is, it's kind of our first candidates to deploy streaming technology. They're expressing a lot of desire to do so. So, our product team is just doing a fantastic job, trying to support as many vendor relationships as we can right now to make sure that we have a viable LTE partner in each market, whether it's an Asia, Europe, or South America. We're seeing demand across all of those markets. We're very excited. I'd like to call you one customer in the UK just signed our largest international Respond-Plus deal to date, which is our live streaming package. That happened in Q2 and we're very excited. There's a few more of those in the pipeline here.\nScott Bird: Great. I'll jump back into the queue. Congrats on a wonderful quarter again.\nAndrea James: We'll take Mita Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Mita. You are up.\nMita Marshall: Great, thanks. We echo my congratulations. You noted that you were doing your investments on the federal sales teams. I just wanted to get a sense of have you started to see the opportunities out of the DOJ? It is mandating of the camera policy or are those still things that we'll build in the pipeline as we go along? As you focus on the federal market, are there any unique software capabilities that you could develop for that market? Thanks\nRick Smith: Yes, absolutely. I appreciate the question. I think if this was a baseball game, we still feel like we're in the first inning here in federal. So, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. We've completed some large framework contracts and we expect customers to now order against those frameworks. We're seeing the business grow across DOJ and DHS and other segments of federal. We keep building the team to more specifically approach the different opportunities within the federal government. Just in the federal civilian market, a lot of opportunity for both body cameras and TASERs. Then, longer term, certainly building products specifically for federal customers, including the military, is on our radar. So, a lot of growth ahead in federal and really believe in the team to keep delivering in that regard.\nMita Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nAndrea James: Okay, we'll take question from Will Power at Baird. Go ahead, Will.\nWill Power: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I've got to ask Rick, since he's driving the car. We'd love to just to hear more about the early learnings on fleet three and ALPR, what do you think now in the vehicles? What are the early indications and comments you're getting from agencies and how do we think about the ramp of that product this year or next couple of years?\nRick Smith: Yes. So first thing I would say is, this is the first product that we've launched that was developed substantially through our new engineering leadership. Hans Moran's our head of engineering came on right before we launched AB3. He kind of picked that up right at the end and he's really brought in some very talented people on his team and they push pretty hard with me to get an additional six months before we took the product to market to really wring out any of the bugs, so we could go to market at quality and it\u2019s scale. And you never want to jinx it by patting yourself on the back this early, but much more hear from customers is that they're really happy with not only the design, but that the system does seem to be pretty wrung out in terms of pretty reliable, and they're not seeing the types of bugs that they've seen in some of our prior launches. We had find that right balance between innovation and speed and quality and testing pre-launch, as we've gotten bigger, especially in each new market, when we're launching a new product and a new market, you may decide to move a little bit faster. But as you start to hit scale like in the TASER and now in the body cameras and fleet business, you've got to be ready to launch at higher volumes and really at higher quality. So, one of these about customers, they really like the fleet was designed clearly to be an in car camera whereas the previous two versions were really spin offs of our body camera hardware. The ALPR is working much better than people expected, I mean, I think we've had customers telling us they've put some of these side by side with their more traditional and much more expensive license plate reader systems, and we're kicking their butt right now, part of it's just the technology of having a color camera makes it we can do state recognition much easier, a lot of the infrared systems struggle with that. And so you'll get a lot of miss reads because you get the plate number right, but the state wrong or to be able to read things like temporary plates, which are the paper ones that are printed out on a laser printer, a traditional infrared system won't even see those, they don't exist because they don't have infrared reflective coatings on it. So, we've also been able to learn through our partnership with Flock, and we've got probably an 18-months headstart of doing these color AI based ALPR cameras. You know, we've invested in them, we've got a board observer seat, we've done integrations on the back end and we're sharing learning\u2019s across so we can both help each other. And I would just say that we're seeing a higher tax rate than we even thought, we would say, and usually agencies didn't think of ALPR is something you put in every car, because of the price point historically it's been well we have our dedicated ALPR vehicles, we have a couple of them. But I think we're seeing pretty widespread like with [indiscernible], some of these other big customers flipping the switch and it's just a software upgrade to put ALPR in every car.\nWill Power: That's great color, thank you. I just like to fit in one more question for whoever wants to take. I'd love just to hear an update on what kind of benefits you're seeing from some of the federal funding initiatives are designed to help state and local, is that something that's having a meaningful impact today, is most that still on the come from what do you see kind of the funding environment side?\nRick Smith: Yes, it's interesting. It's a great question. Well, like, you know, this time last year, the we're wondering, and we're getting a lot of questions about hey what is the shutdowns going to mean for municipal budgets moving forward, and we're very thankful that they didn't seem to have a very large impact and then you tack on some of the federal funding through the different acts including the CARES Act and it's given major cities the opportunity to potentially spend more on technology, I wouldn't say that it's so much of an outlier that it's worth noting though, we're really have the belief that we're able to prove that our products generate a real ROI for our customers and that they're costing themselves money by not deploying our products and so we're really confident that what we're building has real value and that will continue with or without federal support and we're really focused on just continuing to build out those business cases.\nWill Power: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay, next we'll go to Keith Housum at Northcoast. Go ahead, Keith.\nKeith Housum: Thanks. I appreciate it. And congratulations for the quarter. Speaking of the quarter a little bit -- you know, the quarter was just [indiscernible]. Was there anything unusual like large core areas that will not be repeated for the rest of the year; it should be taken into consideration?\nRick Smith: We had some large CW activity internationally Keith, but I'd stopped short of saying that it was so heavy in Q2 that it wouldn't repeat itself in future quarters, we're very optimistic that the growth is going to continue and that we've got a very strong pipeline across both products in domestic and international. And so, we're really excited to get started in the second half year and continuing to grow.\nKeith Housum: Okay, great. And then you just had a paragraph in the letter, you talk about [indiscernible] and properly on to a different various partner, you should consider that like a setback in the look on the dispatch, or just kind of planning in the evolution of the work you guys are doing more now. Can you provide some more context there?\nRick Smith: Yes, so I'll take that one. I would say organizationally it\u2019s a setback, we never let our customers fail. And in this case, I think what we just learned together was we have both underestimated how much strain it was going to put on such a small agency. We need hours per week from their dispatchers to be spending with our software developers and then just having IT support to be able to deploy and train people on software updates, because it has been a moving target. And so this is one of those where I think we saw have great respect and great gratitude for Maricopa, they helped us learn a ton about dispatch and they're going to continue to be a customer along much of our product line, we'll see where it shakes out, they have told us at this point, they just need something that's more mature and stable, they just don't have the bandwidth to keep iterating with us. In some ways, there's a little bit of an accelerator for us in that we have a major say partner and a major county lined up behind them. And we're also learning the needs of some of these big, very high volume CAD installations are just different than they are in the smaller agencies and we think that's where the volume of the market is, and so on the bright side of this is allowing us to really focus in on refining and getting the product for scale of these bigger customers.\nKeith Housum: It was Maricopa your only city or you did you have several other partners there?\nRick Smith: No, they were our first and our only partners, they are still running on it. They've just like I said let us know they're fatigued and they've asked us to support them through the transition and we have, and then we're preparing. We're moving towards deployment we expect next year of a major city and a major County.\nKeith Housum: Great, thanks.\nRick Smith: Just to clarify there Keith, we do have several cities under contract for dispatch. We're just working with them one at a time here as we build the product. And so while Maricopa was the only one live, there are certainly many behind that that are already signed up and contracted.\nKeith Housum: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay, next, Mike Latimore from Northland. Go ahead, Mike.\nMike Latimore: Great. One north to the next north I guess here. You've talked in the past about growing cloud ARR $15 million [ph] a quarter; I guess that's still the goal and if so over the next couple of quarters, what would be the main driver of that growth?\nRick Smith: Mike, great question. That's very much the plan we're still anticipating about 15 million of growth per quarter this year. And when you look out at the investments that we've been making in all the new products that are launching, the majority of them are SaaS centric, software centric, and they're getting traction that's what we tried to highlight in our prepared remarks in our shareholder letter, we're getting traction across the board. It's not any one product per se. And it's the strength across the depth of products, the breadth and depth of products, it's going to keep driving that ARR, in the near term it's going to be about $15 million [ph] per year, and we're hoping that's going to accelerate.\nMike Latimore: Great, and then just on the supply chain shortages that are out there, you know, sort of absent those constraints, how much higher might the revenues be in terms of the guidance here.\nRick Smith: So we've already factored in the supply chain constraints, as Luke talked about, we spent a lot of time internally trying to mitigate those risks and making sure that it's not going to disrupt operations. And the guidance that we've given reflects any potential disruption we might see from supply chain.\nMike Latimore: I guess I was wondering if there's without the supply chain how much higher might have that been?\nRick Smith: Yes, what we've got to do is what we've got to do and then we're going to.\nAndrea James: Yes, Mike. I would just say the guidance reflects a number of factors supply chains, one our demand pipelines another one that there's a number of factors that we take into account in the guidance.\nMike Latimore: Thanks.\nOperator: Ryan Kimbrel, we've got you. Let's take our next question; Ryan Kimbrel from Craig-Hallum. I'm sorry, Ryan, it's our first time talking to you. Hi, welcome.\nRyan Kimbrel: Okay, right. Just one for me, I just wanted to touch on conversion rates. I'm not sure what detail you track conversion, but I'm wondering how that's trended over the last say year and a half and you know if you want to be more general and be started to convert more of those quality leads as your customers budget situation has become a little bit healthier?\nRick Smith: So, thanks for the question, Ryan. I think we're not going to disclose too much on conversion rates other than to say of whenever there's an opportunity for body cams, cloud, TASERs, dams, RMS or CAD, we expect to be competitive. It's a very, very competitive market. There's a lot of vendors in it. But we do our best to position our products in a way that the customer will value the most and certainly we expect to win, we want to win. We've got a competitive team and that's the tone we want to set.\nRyan Kimbrel: All right, fair enough. Thanks, guys. And congrats, again.\nAndrea James: Okay, wondering if any of you guys have hopped back into the kill. So go ahead and use the hand race feature. Give me a second here. Now, are we good to go. Okay, great. We'll have Rick, close this out.\nRick Smith: All right. Thanks, everybody. It was pretty fun doing this from the fleet vehicle. It was not planned, but we were at a customer site and the customer wanted to keep going and I think it was the right call. So this was an unexpected benefit. We appreciate the new faces. We appreciate those who've been with us for a while. Obviously, the business is really doing well and we're excited to see what happens in the back half of the years, Josh and his team continue to go out and bring in the revenue and our development teams keep launching products, and the new products are scaling. There's a lot of great stuff going on, lot of positive energy. And we'll look forward to seeing you all on our next quarterly zoom. So everybody stay safe. And let's get this delta variant behind us to get back to normal and we can. Thanks, everybody.",

Our recent partnerships and investments are reflective of our vision for the Axon brand to become synonymous with public safety. And equally important, allow us to leverage and expand our platform in a transformative way. To build a public safety ecosystem of the future, we're aligning with other innovators and technology disruptors. For example, our expanding ecosystem relationships with Celebrate and Rapid SOS were driven by our focus on customers and their growing needs for digital evidence management and real-time operations. Our strategic investments in companies, such as Flock Safety, have done well and even more importantly, supported our fleet three go-to-market by allowing us to bundle and co sell our solutions, which you can literally see on display today. Our partnership with Skydio makes their drones in autonomy software solutions available to agencies through AXON. It also paves the way for the integration of Skydio's offerings with AXON product suite, giving customers groundbreaking evidence management, real-time situational awareness, and scene reconstruction capabilities. We take our role as capital stewards very seriously and I'm thrilled to share these exciting updates that demonstrate how our investments are creating real value for the company, our customers, and our shareholders. With that, Andrea, let's move to questions."

            "content": "Thanks, Rick. The business is firing on all cylinders and we are focused on sustaining momentum. Operationally, we're doing really well, even in the face of global supply chain risk. The reality of the current macro situation is well documented, from geopolitical factors to semiconductor and resin shortages, to logistics, import stoppages are the continued impact of COVID. There's never been a more complex time to make electronics, we have risen to the challenge, and we monitor conditions daily and have put risk mitigation strategies in place that are supporting a rapid growth. While these headwinds persist, our teams are definitely navigating and effectively positioning the business to continue to meet our increasing demand pipeline. In fact, our teams are delivering Olympic level execution on behalf of all of our stakeholders, most notably our customers and our shareholders. Another area where you will see this is our teaser segment gross margins, which are up 500 basis points over last year, as we sell into strong demand; we have engineered costs out of our building materials, and the effects of that continued into this quarter. As you saw in our video and read in our letter, we are ecstatic about the fleet 3 launch and that it's shipping; and we're getting ecstatic reviews from our early customers, as Rick mentioned earlier. And we believe we're just getting started with virtual reality training, with booking nearing $8 million in the first six months, up less than $1 million in the first six months of last year. You've heard me talk about virtual reality on the last several earnings calls, and we're pleased of the demand that we're seeing, and that validates our excitement. We're looking forward to a strong back half of the year and continued momentum into 2022. And with that, let me turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jawad Ahsan."

            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "All right. Great job on the video, Andrea. And folks, I'm giving for Andrea a heart-attack today; I was supposed to be safely in my home office connected to the internet, but I've been out all day, with most of the summer doing customer demos. I'm in the fleet three demo vehicle, and we had a bunch of great meetings today. In fact, we're going to do this live without a net, I am going to do a quick screen share and show you what we're seeing live from the fleet vehicle here; hang on a second. All right, so as you can see there, hey, Garrett wave; in the backseat, we have our prisoner transport area, that's Garrett Langley, the CEO of Flock Safety, an incredible partner of ours, they do -- they are all here with another customers. They've told us today about a number of crimes they've already solved, thanks to Flock cameras. And then we do the mobile; so it's [indiscernible] has been a great investment for us, and really brings powerful capability through partnership; you'll see on the upper left there is a wide angle camera, and then on the right is our high resolution 4K camera that we use for the license plate reading, gives us great resolution at closing speeds of upto 140 miles an hour. Yes, we've got our Product Manager here as well. I'll show you -- here is an example of a plate read; this is from -- just a sample list we use not from criminal data; so this is just a sample we did earlier today. And you'll see -- this will pop an alert; the officer can then check and make sure that it's got it correct, they can go in and they can do things like categorize their existing videos, whether it's the in-car body cameras, etcetera. It's a really intuitive simple user interface, and we're getting fantastic customer reviews. All right, so with that -- I have been traveling a lot seeing our customers which has been great. We've also been encouraged to see this summer at The National Conversation Ramp; policing is evolving to reflect what we've known all along, i.e. police reform and progress bars investment, and focused attention from our best and brightest minds. We're obviously pumped about our quarterly performance, and I couldn't be prouder of how our team is executing and it's translating into growth that we've sustained now over the last few years, and we intend to keep doing it. I'm also proud of our product development team. They have been working really hard as we've invested to build these transformative capabilities. In the fleet three, which I just demoed right here; we're able to bring artificial intelligence, to bring ALPR to every car. Within 90 days of launch, we've already been done deploying 550 vehicles at Pinellas County [ph], and to my awareness, I -- as far as I know, that's the largest ALPR in the country, and it's happening literally within weeks our product launch. And we're already late stage negotiations with another major city to deploy over 1,500 license plate readers, more than doubling what we're doing right now, tech analysis. So you all know, you know, you shouldn't text and drive; those who are doing this all the time they're typing in license plates while they're driving, or they've got to read it in over the radio. Fleet Street [ph] does that for them at a dramatically lower price point, allowing them to deploy this to every car making driving safer, and reducing crime. We've already had customers just in the first few weeks catching serious offenders and finding missing children. On another front our Axon evidence software continues to grow well beyond simply being a backend for our cameras. We want highly competitive digital evidence program in EMEA with an EMEA government encompassing the management of all digital evidence, independent of body camera programs; and this builds on to similar success we've had in Canada and paves the way for us to continue to lead with our software solutions. We feel really well positioned for the back half of the year and beyond as we see traction beyond core, U.S. municipal law enforcement moving into counties and state patrols, federal government and private enterprises. International revenue grew 60% in Q2 and international bookings, which are our forward looking indicator nearly tripled. So in some my part, at Axon, we're excited, we're leading the way in creating a work environment where employees can maximize their happiness and productivity. We offer remote hybrid options; you can work from the office, you can work from your home, you can work from your car; I'm showing you today even on the earnings call. So, we're focused on doing whatever it takes to get the best top tier talent, keep them focused, keep them rested, keep them happy, keep them energized, keep them creative and that's how you get great products and breakout capabilities. So our leadership is now supported by an exceptional workforce that is almost 2,000 people and that's what is going to help drive us to long-term profitable growth; this continuing to build and maintain and groom a fantastic team. And with that, let me turn over to the President of the Company, Luke Larson. Great question. Supply chain constraints are a reality for every manufacturer, as we all know. We're managing through it because a lot of intention internally, specifically for me and my teams that as we work to mitigate that risk. Some of the things that we've done to mitigate risk is we've bought out and we bought in advance and beefed up our supply chain and our guiding factors is in the reality. Even with the supply chain constraints, we still feel really strong about the guidance that we put out earlier. Thanks for the question, Jonathan, nice to see you again. For us, it's really about focusing on building the right teams to enter these markets and we've talked about in the past on our federal team as well as Mike Shore on our enterprise security team and a lot of folks around the business that are opening up new segments for us. It's really just putting in the work. There's no shortcut to that and we're building stronger relationships. We're identifying stakeholders early in the federal space, we're identifying opportunities within the budget cycles within congress to fund some future projects. I think the team is just executing really well across all of those fronts. So very, very excited for what the future holds for our newer markets. I think there's opportunity across the across the globe, Scott. Three or four years ago, when we started really explaining how we're thinking of going to market, we focused on three individual markets UK, Australia, and Canada and all of those continue to perform really well. What we're seeing in those markets is there's wider adoption of our product line. So, body cams, TASERs, and new developments [indiscernible] without body cams, meaning managing other types of digital evidence that are not generated by body cameras. Of course, longer term, we're excited about things like -- in interview room and in records and so forth. So, in those tier-one markets, they continue to lead the way as we expand our product portfolio. Then there's growing opportunity in tier two and tier three markets just on TASERs and body cameras. The cloud is not a great fit everywhere across the world right now. So, in markets like that, we're really focusing more on the TASER side and building an install base that we can go back to later and sell body cameras in the cloud and it's working out. We're seeing TASER orders in very large volumes. We expect that to continue. It's not necessarily something that will happen every quarter, but every year for sure. We're really encouraged by just the growth in both in APAC, EMEA, and the Americas. So, very excited to see international continuing to grow. A lot of people put a lot of hard work into it and we have plenty of runway left in front of us. Yes, absolutely. I appreciate the question. I think if this was a baseball game, we still feel like we're in the first inning here in federal. So, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. We've completed some large framework contracts and we expect customers to now order against those frameworks. We're seeing the business grow across DOJ and DHS and other segments of federal. We keep building the team to more specifically approach the different opportunities within the federal government. Just in the federal civilian market, a lot of opportunity for both body cameras and TASERs. Then, longer term, certainly building products specifically for federal customers, including the military, is on our radar. So, a lot of growth ahead in federal and really believe in the team to keep delivering in that regard. Yes. So first thing I would say is, this is the first product that we've launched that was developed substantially through our new engineering leadership. Hans Moran's our head of engineering came on right before we launched AB3. He kind of picked that up right at the end and he's really brought in some very talented people on his team and they push pretty hard with me to get an additional six months before we took the product to market to really wring out any of the bugs, so we could go to market at quality and it's scale. And you never want to jinx it by patting yourself on the back this early, but much more hear from customers is that they're really happy with not only the design, but that the system does seem to be pretty wrung out in terms of pretty reliable, and they're not seeing the types of bugs that they've seen in some of our prior launches. We had find that right balance between innovation and speed and quality and testing pre-launch, as we've gotten bigger, especially in each new market, when we're launching a new product and a new market, you may decide to move a little bit faster. But as you start to hit scale like in the TASER and now in the body cameras and fleet business, you've got to be ready to launch at higher volumes and really at higher quality. So, one of these about customers, they really like the fleet was designed clearly to be an in car camera whereas the previous two versions were really spin offs of our body camera hardware. The ALPR is working much better than people expected, I mean, I think we've had customers telling us they've put some of these side by side with their more traditional and much more expensive license plate reader systems, and we're kicking their butt right now, part of it's just the technology of having a color camera makes it we can do state recognition much easier, a lot of the infrared systems struggle with that. And so you'll get a lot of miss reads because you get the plate number right, but the state wrong or to be able to read things like temporary plates, which are the paper ones that are printed out on a laser printer, a traditional infrared system won't even see those, they don't exist because they don't have infrared reflective coatings on it. So, we've also been able to learn through our partnership with Flock, and we've got probably an 18-months headstart of doing these color AI based ALPR cameras. You know, we've invested in them, we've got a board observer seat, we've done integrations on the back end and we're sharing learning's across so we can both help each other. And I would just say that we're seeing a higher tax rate than we even thought, we would say, and usually agencies didn't think of ALPR is something you put in every car, because of the price point historically it's been well we have our dedicated ALPR vehicles, we have a couple of them. But I think we're seeing pretty widespread like with [indiscernible], some of these other big customers flipping the switch and it's just a software upgrade to put ALPR in every car. Yes, it's interesting. It's a great question. Well, like, you know, this time last year, the we're wondering, and we're getting a lot of questions about hey what is the shutdowns going to mean for municipal budgets moving forward, and we're very thankful that they didn't seem to have a very large impact and then you tack on some of the federal funding through the different acts including the CARES Act and it's given major cities the opportunity to potentially spend more on technology, I wouldn't say that it's so much of an outlier that it's worth noting though, we're really have the belief that we're able to prove that our products generate a real ROI for our customers and that they're costing themselves money by not deploying our products and so we're really confident that what we're building has real value and that will continue with or without federal support and we're really focused on just continuing to build out those business cases. We had some large CW activity internationally Keith, but I'd stopped short of saying that it was so heavy in Q2 that it wouldn't repeat itself in future quarters, we're very optimistic that the growth is going to continue and that we've got a very strong pipeline across both products in domestic and international. And so, we're really excited to get started in the second half year and continuing to grow. Yes, so I'll take that one. I would say organizationally it's a setback, we never let our customers fail. And in this case, I think what we just learned together was we have both underestimated how much strain it was going to put on such a small agency. We need hours per week from their dispatchers to be spending with our software developers and then just having IT support to be able to deploy and train people on software updates, because it has been a moving target. And so this is one of those where I think we saw have great respect and great gratitude for Maricopa, they helped us learn a ton about dispatch and they're going to continue to be a customer along much of our product line, we'll see where it shakes out, they have told us at this point, they just need something that's more mature and stable, they just don't have the bandwidth to keep iterating with us. In some ways, there's a little bit of an accelerator for us in that we have a major say partner and a major county lined up behind them. And we're also learning the needs of some of these big, very high volume CAD installations are just different than they are in the smaller agencies and we think that's where the volume of the market is, and so on the bright side of this is allowing us to really focus in on refining and getting the product for scale of these bigger customers. No, they were our first and our only partners, they are still running on it. They've just like I said let us know they're fatigued and they've asked us to support them through the transition and we have, and then we're preparing. We're moving towards deployment we expect next year of a major city and a major County. Just to clarify there Keith, we do have several cities under contract for dispatch. We're just working with them one at a time here as we build the product. And so while Maricopa was the only one live, there are certainly many behind that that are already signed up and contracted. Mike, great question. That's very much the plan we're still anticipating about 15 million of growth per quarter this year. And when you look out at the investments that we've been making in all the new products that are launching, the majority of them are SaaS centric, software centric, and they're getting traction that's what we tried to highlight in our prepared remarks in our shareholder letter, we're getting traction across the board. It's not any one product per se. And it's the strength across the depth of products, the breadth and depth of products, it's going to keep driving that ARR, in the near term it's going to be about $15 million [ph] per year, and we're hoping that's going to accelerate. So we've already factored in the supply chain constraints, as Luke talked about, we spent a lot of time internally trying to mitigate those risks and making sure that it's not going to disrupt operations. And the guidance that we've given reflects any potential disruption we might see from supply chain. Yes, what we've got to do is what we've got to do and then we're going to. So, thanks for the question, Ryan. I think we're not going to disclose too much on conversion rates other than to say of whenever there's an opportunity for body cams, cloud, TASERs, dams, RMS or CAD, we expect to be competitive. It's a very, very competitive market. There's a lot of vendors in it. But we do our best to position our products in a way that the customer will value the most and certainly we expect to win, we want to win. We've got a competitive team and that's the tone we want to set. All right. Thanks, everybody. It was pretty fun doing this from the fleet vehicle. It was not planned, but we were at a customer site and the customer wanted to keep going and I think it was the right call. So this was an unexpected benefit. We appreciate the new faces. We appreciate those who've been with us for a while. Obviously, the business is really doing well and we're excited to see what happens in the back half of the years, Josh and his team continue to go out and bring in the revenue and our development teams keep launching products, and the new products are scaling. There's a lot of great stuff going on, lot of positive energy. And we'll look forward to seeing you all on our next quarterly zoom. So everybody stay safe. And let's get this delta variant behind us to get back to normal and we can. Thanks, everybody."

We're seeing markets, but we do not necessarily think about our plan is, it's kind of our first candidates to deploy streaming technology. They're expressing a lot of desire to do so. So, our product team is just doing a fantastic job, trying to support as many vendor relationships as we can right now to make sure that we have a viable LTE partner in each market, whether it's an Asia, Europe, or South America. We're seeing demand across all of those markets. We're very excited. I'd like to call you one customer in the UK just signed our largest international Respond-Plus deal to date, which is our live streaming package. That happened in Q2 and we're very excited.

I\u2019m Andrea James, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Today, we have with us CEO, Rick Smith; President, Luke Larson; CFO, Jawad Ahsan; Chief Revenue Officer, Josh Isner; and Chief Product Officer, Jeff Kunins. I hope you\u2019ve all had a chance to read our very robust shareholder letter, which we released after the market closed. You can find it at investor.axon.com. Our remarks today are meant to build upon the information in that robust letter. At the end of this call, we\u2019ll play our quarterly earnings video. That\u2019s our first time doing it on the earnings call, and you\u2019re welcome to stay for that. If for some reason, we lose connectivity, we\u2019ll endeavor to post a copy of our prepared remarks to investor.axon.com.

Now, turning it over to Rick.\nRick Smith: Thanks, Andrea, and hello, everyone. As you can see from the shareholder letter, we\u2019ve had an exceptional start to the year. Our teams have remained heads down, executing on our mission and driving growth across all of our products and markets. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what we\u2019ve built of Axon\u2019s position as a true change agent and ultimately and most exciting, where we\u2019re heading. We\u2019ve always been passionate about innovation, and the inherent drive continues to propel our business forward. Today, I\u2019d like to address current events, public and personal that are relevant to our business. First, recent current events, including last year\u2019s death of George Floyd and the events that followed, forced our nation to reflect upon the values we hold true for all Americans. Axon is and will remain committed to creating technologies that save lives, increase transparency and help communities and public safety agencies who serve them, achieve a higher quality of life to ensure everyone makes it home safe. Customers and increasingly communities, see us as a key thought leader and key partner in the global drive to transform public safety. We hear stories daily about customers using our products to save lives and protect their communities. And we believe our problem-solving approach to these major challenges will continue to drive our growth. Two years ago when I published my book, The End of Killing, it was a radical idea that we can actually make the bullet obsolete and create less lethal weapons that could become the primary use of force and eventually displace lethal weapons. Customers were far more receptive to this idea than I could have anticipated. And in light of the events of the past 12 months, we are here pleased from our public safety customers and the broader community that they cannot wait until the deadline I had set at the end of this decade for us to achieve the goal of surpassing the sidearm and effectiveness. Our teams are working extremely hard to bring in the date for the next-generation of TASER weapons, which I believe will be the largest single leaping capability in the history of less lethal weapons. Customers have even begun signing 10-year programs with us to enable seamless upgrades, and we worked with them to create programs that will even allow them early upgrades when the next-generation launches. Now, to set expectation, the next-generation of TASER is a couple of years out due to the intense testing a ground-up new design requires, as well as the full production automation and scaling. But, I wanted to talk about the issue head on, given the growing intense public interest and to help our investors understand why you might be seeing this dynamic behind 10-year program? Second, on a personal note, the passing of my father, Phil Smith, our founding Chairman, last month, was a monumental loss. He was instrumental in helping to get TASER off the ground in its early days, and our Company would not exist without it. His final 24 hours were an amazing capstone to an incredible life. His mission lives on among all of us at Axon, and I will miss calling him after the call today to discuss the results. As we look to the future, Axon can be a huge force for progress through our vision of obsoleting the bullet, reducing social conflict, enabling a fair and effective justice system and building for racial equity, diversity and inclusion. Luke and Jawad will now take you through some more highlights of our business.\nLuke Larson: Thanks, Rick. As stated in our shareholder letter, which we\u2019ve got a ton of positive feedback on, shout out to our IR team, our teams are executing on our 2021 strategic priorities to grow our core, scale new products, unlock new markets and drive efficiency to fuel growth. We believe Axon has been at the forefront of change. But the past year, we\u2019ve been put in the center of truly unprecedented events that inspired our teams to show up in many new ways. Our body cameras are capturing the most critical events in the world. We\u2019re proud of that. And it\u2019s a responsibility we take very seriously. During the civil unrest in the Capitol on January 6, for instance, DC Metropolitan Police and the Montgomery County Police who are Axon Body customers were called in for backup and the Justice Department has released Axon Body camera videos related to that incident. Axon Body cameras are also providing critical evidence in many of the current events that we\u2019re all familiar with. Just last week, NPR published a story about a team of public safety experts and world economists that says body-worn cameras are both, beneficial and cost-effective. The University of Chicago Crime Lab and the Council on Criminal Justice Task Force on Policing, released a report and stated the key benefit of body-worn cameras is the reduced use of police force. For example, among the police department study, they saw complaints against police dropped 17%, and this is really the compelling statistic is that use of force by police during fatal and nonfatal encounters fell by nearly 10%. Professor Jens Ludwig, Head of the Crime Lab, says, if you\u2019re a local government looking at adopting the cost from your narrow green eyeshade bottom line, the technology probably pays for itself and the benefits to the public are a huge win and easily outweigh the cost. Our focus as a management team is to invest in growth, so that we can continue delivering technologies to protect life and truce. In February, we outlined the capital investments we\u2019re making this year, including the TASER manufacturing, we have a great update to share on that front as you see in our shareholder letter. These investments are growing the TASER manufacturing capacity and driving gross margin expansion. This positions us to meet growing TASER demand globally and in our federal sector. So far this year, TASER device manufacturing and supply chain improvements are on track to deliver more than $4 million in gross cost savings in 2021. We are also excited about the momentum that we are seeing in our Software and Sensors segment. Later this year, we expect to launch our third-generation fleet solution. This is our dashboard cam solution, which features AI powered, automatic license plate recognition, known in the industry as ALPR. Demand for this premium fleet bundle, which includes ALPR software add-on and the live streaming off of our cameras is exceeding our expectations by a healthy margin, and you can read more about this in detail in our shareholder letter. We are also seeing growing adoption in the usage of LTE-enabled live streaming off of the body cameras and remote evidence uploads. And in the coming weeks, we expect to transition the Baltimore Police Department to our record solution, and the training and feedback has been going very well. Finally, we\u2019re transforming how agencies train their officers by addressing the inefficiencies around the classroom, role-playing and simulator training. By leveraging VR, we are addressing their two biggest issues, budget and time. In the coming days, we have an exciting product launch that we can\u2019t wait to tell you more about. We just did a sneak peak of our big VR announcement yesterday with TASER\u2019s training advisory board, and it was very well received. We have a lot to be excited about in 2021 and beyond. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jawad.\nJawad Ahsan: Thanks, Luke. As our teams continue to execute at an extremely high level, we\u2019re able to confidently invest in our future. Our strong balance sheet also gives us the flexibility to drive growth broadly across products, markets and geographies. We\u2019ve recently made three strategic investments in Flock Safety, RapidSOS and Cellebrite, as well as expanded our strategic partnerships. These were carefully crafted moves that allow us to extend our platform as we aim to build the public safety ecosystem of the future. In Q1, we invested $20 million in RapidSOS and more recently completed a strategic partnership. When people dial 911, lives are literally in the balance when the call center doesn\u2019t know where they are. RapidSOS is a leader in solving this problem. For example, if you call 911 today, using your iPhone, in the vast majority of U.S. jurisdictions, Apple will send your location to public safety via RapidSOS. Now, the location and live streams of Axon Body cameras and Axon Fleet cameras can be integrated into the RapidSOS platform, and RapidSOS data can be integrated into our new Axon Respond dispatching platform. Another recent investment in strategic partnership includes a $90 million participation in a PIPE transaction in connection with Cellebrite going public by a SPAC IPO. Cellebrite is the market leader in digital intelligence. Their software complements our lead in digital evidence management, and they share our strong emphasis on safeguards to protect privacy. We are consistently hearing great feedback from our customers in common with Cellebrite, and the company has been delivering compelling results. This partnership will make Evidence.com even more valuable for our customers. From an M&A perspective, as you can see, we\u2019re taking a deliberate approach to how we partner and deploy our capital. You can expect to see us continue to be opportunistic and make strategic moves that strengthen and extend our platform. To be clear, we will be highly selective. Our continued strong execution allows us to make these types of investments and keep our strategic focus on investing for growth. However, it\u2019s really the fact that we always lead with our mission to protect life, truce in the communities we serve that has us taking a long-term view on our business. As we work towards goals such as obsoleting the bullet, we are measuring our progress over a longer term horizon. In fact, we\u2019d like to invite you to think about our business the way that we do in terms of years and not quarters. This is why today, we are introducing two-year revenue guidance for both, 2021 and 2022. For 2021, we are raising our revenue guidance by $40 million at the midpoint to $800 million. In 2022, our early view of the year anticipates that we will deliver approximately $920 million in revenue. The combination of positive underlying demand trends and our strategic growth and expansion initiatives gives us tremendous confidence in our longer term outlook. We\u2019ve been making investments in several new geographies outside of the U.S. and many of these investments are starting to yield results. The nature of the international market is such that the deals are often for larger regions or entire nations. The larger and more complex nature of these deals makes their timing difficult to forecast and thus, growth is not as linear as we might expect in the U.S. We, therefore, expect the phasing of revenue from international deals to contribute to variability in our quarterly revenue, a trend we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. This is why we\u2019re anchoring on annual revenue guidance. We don\u2019t want the timing of large international deals to signal anything about the underlying growth rate of our business. We are laser-focused on building a business that will sustainably grow at a 20%-plus CAGR. I want to reiterate that we are committed to continuing to execute and invest with rigor and discipline. As such, and given our strength and outlook for the year, we\u2019re raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 by $12.5 million at the midpoint. We\u2019re also maintaining our long-term target adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%, while continuing to invest for growth. I\u2019d like to close by highlighting another aspect of Axon that I\u2019m particularly proud of. How diversified we\u2019ve become. We sell hardware and software, solutions and services, products and training. We\u2019ve diversified geographically as well as to the types of customers we sell to. Revenues from our market-leading tailored devices and body cameras remain on a strong growth trajectory, while our ARR has now surpassed $240 million and is expected to grow approximately $15 million per quarter. I\u2019ve never felt better about how Axon is positioned for growth, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how our team continues to deliver. And with that, Andrea, let\u2019s move to questions.\nA - Andrea James: Thanks, Jawad and team. I just want to check with our moderators that we can bring everybody up into the gallery view. And given me a nod when we are up in gallery view. Okay. We are up in gallery review. And analysts, we\u2019ve got you all in our queue. So, no need to use the hand raise feature. And just let us know if you have a follow-up. We\u2019ll take our first question from Keith Housum at Northcoast.\nRick Smith: That\u2019s my move, Keith. You\u2019re on mute. I got a patent on that.\nKeith Housum: All right. How are we doing now? All right. Thanks guys. Congratulations on a great quarter, and I appreciate the guidance going forward. Rick, it looks like now two quarters in a row, fantastic TASER sales with growth. Perhaps you can provide a little bit more color on what you think some of the drivers are. How are you guys achieving this TASER growth the past few quarters? And I guess, previous quarter [indiscernible] type of growth?\nRick Smith: Yes. I\u2019ll touch on it. And then, Josh, I\u2019ll hand it off to you. I would say, there\u2019s really a shifting focus. 10 years ago, the focus with TASER, there was a lot of focus on sort of the medical safety of the devices. I think, we\u2019ve come out of that, where now there\u2019s really an intense focus on effectiveness. And in my book, where I talked about, I\u2019m very transparent. We are not yet reliable enough to be a substitute for lethal force, but we\u2019re heading that direction. We made a big step with TASER 7, and we\u2019ll make an even bigger step on our next launch. And I think our customers are pretty excited, and we\u2019re just seeing a lot of TASER 7 adoption that has really kind of picked up. We\u2019re also seeing, I think, broader international adoption. There\u2019s -- we\u2019re getting -- I see orders coming in our daily reports, and I got to go look at the map to see where some of these countries are that a few years ago, weren\u2019t even on our radar, and now we\u2019re getting much broader coverage. And with that, Josh, let me hand over to you.\nJosh Isner: Yes. Thank you, Rick. Ultimately, I think it\u2019s just a continued story of a lot of investments in the channel that we\u2019ve made over the years are starting to pay off. As Jawad said, we\u2019re diversifying, state and local law enforcement is absolutely a big part of that growth story, but so is international, so is federal, so is corrections. And so, we\u2019ve got a lot of talented people doing a lot of great work right now. And we\u2019ll continue to invest in white space in the channel to make sure those results continue to grow in the out years.\nKeith Housum: Okay, great. And then, just if I could, my follow-up, I\u2019ve got a guy ask a question about the supply chain issues that\u2019s happening really across all technologies these days. I guess, where in your portfolio of products, I guess, do you have any pinch points with supply chain? And are the issues getting worse here as we\u2019re going into the second quarter?\nJeff Kunins: Yes. Great question, Keith. I\u2019ll fill that. So, our supply chain and ops team is led by a phenomenal guy, named Josh Goldman. And over the last year, we\u2019ve really put buffers in place to ensure that we can meet the quarterly demand, as well as forecast out critical components. And I\u2019ve just got to give the team a lot of credit to have navigated the last 12 months, and we\u2019re keeping that same strategy looking forward. And as of today, we feel really good about it.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Keith. We\u2019ll take our next question from Will Power at Baird.\nWill Power: Great, okay. Thanks for taking the question. Rick, first, sorry for your loss.\nRick Smith: Thanks, Will. On the positive side, I hope to die the way he did. It was actually as positive and uplifting as such a thing could be.\nWill Power: Okay. That\u2019s good. Well, congratulations on the results. Obviously, really strong across the board. I guess, maybe broadly looking at the opportunities in the U.S. in the spending habits. What are you seeing in terms of municipal budgets, any headwinds on that front? And to what degree are some of the federal aid plans helping?\nRick Smith: Josh?\nJosh Isner: Absolutely. So, I think, about this time last year, there were a lot of questions about how that would materialize, and we\u2019re still very happy to say it really hasn\u2019t in a meaningful way. And in fact, a lot of the federal conveyed packages have provided additional funding to state and local. At first, it was mainly the large cities, but in the latest grant package, it was for small and midsized cities as well. So, we don\u2019t see any kind of systematic challenges across municipal funding that make it any more or less worried some than in the past. We think it\u2019s in front of us, and we provide the right products that our customers value. We really believe that they\u2019ll be able to find funding to buy them.\nWill Power: Okay. That\u2019s great. And if I could sneak in just one. Really nice to see some of the early Fleet 3 indicators. I\u2019m wondering if you could just provide any more color as to what\u2019s kind of helping set you apart in the market? Any issues potentially on the supply side in terms of meeting that demand? Just any more background there would be great.\nRick Smith: I\u2019m sorry, what was it? I couldn\u2019t hear what product are you referring to, Will?\nJeff Kunins: Fleet.\nJosh Isner: Fleet. Why don\u2019t I take the first stab and then pass it to Jeff. So, one thing that I talked about that we\u2019re really excited about is just the attach rate to the ALPR. And this is one where I think the customers are saying, hey, I can go with one solution with Axon and get these two critical benefits. It also is a great story around how we\u2019re able to provide not only the hardware but also the software and advanced software that the customers are willing to pay for it. Go ahead, Jeff.\nJeff Kunins: Yes. Just continuing on that. First and foremost, on the camera system itself, we\u2019re really proud and looking forward to shipping it to customers that is overwhelmingly our best camera system ever for the car. And we\u2019ve -- just on those merits alone, that drives a lot of the demand that we\u2019re seeing. And then, as we\u2019ve alluded to, one of the things that is Axon\u2019s greatest strength is how we combine these devices with the power of intelligent cloud services. And so, both, with our Respond live streaming connected and as well as our Vievu disruptively affordable and ethically designed from the ground up approach to ALPR really creates, for the first time, the ability for an agency to afford for the same budgets they\u2019re used to spending to put ALPR capability in every single vehicle. And so, you put all that together at an attractive overall price. And again, we still have -- we look forward to shipping it later this year and seeing how customers love it.\nRick Smith: I\u2019ve got to add one more thing. And maybe we\u2019re too transparent sometimes. But with Fleet 1 and 2, we\u2019re scrapping, we have to get to market fast. The hardware was not our strength in those products. And we still got to, I think, the top end of the suppliers in the market. Fleet 3, now we\u2019re bringing our a game. This is the first camera where the hardware has been designed from the ground up for this use case. Previously, we did take our body cameras and then refactor them to the car. And we learned a ton by doing that. But, I\u2019m really pumped to see what\u2019s going to happen because what we\u2019re bringing on now has been purpose-built over a multiyear period by some really talented and awesome folks. So, I\u2019m excited to see how it performs in the market.\nAndrea James: All right. Thanks. Well, we love the families here at Axon. We\u2019ll take our next question from Jonathan Ho at William Blair. Go ahead, Jonathan.\nJonathan Ho: I wanted to just start out with the two-year guidance. Just given the lumpiness that you\u2019re seeing in some of these international deals and the longer sales cycles, I guess, can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re building that long run above forecast? And what maybe gives you the confidence to be able to offer a two-year view this early?\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. I\u2019d like to start with that, and would love to hear Josh\u2019s input as well. So, there are a couple of factors, Jonathan. The first one is, look, quite frankly, the business is rocking and rolling. We\u2019ve got -- you\u2019ve heard us allude to it. We\u2019ve collected a pretty fantastic collection of talent in all of our functions, and they are executing crisply and reliably. And I have a tremendous amount of confidence in them. The pipeline that we\u2019ve built, I feel like we\u2019ve got a very high likelihood that we\u2019re going to execute on that to such a degree that I feel confident going out two years on our guidance. The second factor is -- and we\u2019ve also alluded to this, is that these international deals, it makes it difficult for us to give quarter-to-quarter guidance. It\u2019s better for us to think in terms of years. Because they\u2019re larger, they\u2019re more complex, there\u2019s so many more factors involved, financial, operational, regulatory, political. And really, we think about the business in terms of years. And what we\u2019re working towards is to build a business that will sustainably grow at a 20%-plus CAGR year-over-year.\nJosh Isner: And then, lastly, I would just add, one of the benefits of really focusing on bookings as a forward-looking indicator of our results. Our bookings continue to grow year in and year out. And we saw that last year. We\u2019re seeing it this year as well. And we\u2019re very excited about what that means for the future. So, we certainly do between bringing on more and more enterprise sales talent that gets better and better at forecasting, combining that with having growing bookings year-over-year, it gives us a lot of confidence that we\u2019re going to keep growing.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. Can you also maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of the traction that you\u2019re seeing relative to the RMS and CAD solutions, specifically your software suite? And maybe how that\u2019s sort of contributing to net retention and some of the expansionary metrics there as well? Thank you.\nJosh Isner: Certainly. We\u2019re really excited. We\u2019re seeing customers that have had a lot of confidence in us historically willing to partner with us more on our newer offerings. When we go into police departments, one of the questions we always ask is, what\u2019s the best piece of functioning software you deploy today? And oftentimes we hear it\u2019s Evidence.com. And that inspires a lot of confidence from our customers that the next piece of enterprise software we deliver is going to be equally good or better. And so, right now, we have to be very careful in terms of making sure that we set the right expectations. We bring on the right customers for us early on, and we make those customers really successful. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now. And we believe just like we have in every category that we\u2019ve entered, we turn those early evangelists into a growing market over the years to come, and we have a lot of confidence we\u2019re going to do that in our records and dispatch as well.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Jonathan. We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum. Go ahead, Jeremy.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks. And congratulations on the strong results, and also as well my thoughts on your family. I wanted to actually ask about Cellebrite. And thinking about the investments that you\u2019ve made in that business, what is the likelihood that with the rapid growth that they\u2019re seeing that you\u2019re going to have additional investments made in that business down the road? How much more integrated can you potentially see these businesses becoming?\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. I\u2019ll start. So, Cellebrite is a company that we\u2019ve been admiring from a far for some time now. We had a chance to build a relationship with them prior to the SPAC deal coming on our radar. It\u2019s someone we really admired. As we talk about, they\u2019re a leader in digital intelligence. We think it\u2019s a very natural extension of our lead in digital evidence management. And this is a long-term play. We really view our partnership with them as strategically important to Axon. And we\u2019ll evaluate the opportunity to invest more or something beyond that going forward. But, at this point, we feel really good about where we\u2019re at.\nLuke Larson: I think, I would just add to that. Just as Jawad talked about earlier, you can see that pattern in all of these very judicious investments we\u2019ve made so far. So, between Flock Safety and then RapidSOS and then now with Cellebrite, all of them are -- yes, they\u2019re a financial investments, but they\u2019re very purposefully chosen to be a match for places where customers win as we do interesting things together commercially as well. And the investment is an accelerant to what we would otherwise want to naturally do as great partners.\nJeremy Hamblin: Great. And then, I also wanted to just ask about your annual recurring revenue, you\u2019ve had very steady pace on this. It\u2019s roughly $20 million a quarter that you\u2019re adding on. As the Company gets bigger and bigger, what would potentially drive deviation to the upside from that $20 million a quarter? Is it just perhaps just gaining significant traction in RMS? Is that going to be the big driver? But, how do we potentially step up from that level from here?\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. So, one of the things that Josh alluded to is for us, the leading indicator is really bookings. And we\u2019re right now, just like we\u2019ve made investments in new international markets, we\u2019re also making investments in these new product categories, like records and dispatch. And we\u2019re in the very early innings. We\u2019re building a product that we\u2019re very proud of. And we think it\u2019s going to be a market leader. And so, the leading indicator for us is going to be bookings. As those bookings come in, we think that will just continue to add that will end up translating into ARR.\nAndrea James: Jeremy, I just wanted to piggyback, just real quick just to make sure your numbers on that one. We\u2019re very proud of the rate that we\u2019re adding ARR, but it\u2019s been -- the average over the last year has been closer to $15 million a quarter. And that\u2019s what Jawad, the number he referenced in his script as well. We\u2019ll take our next question from John Godin [ph] at Needham. Go ahead, John.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. I appreciate you taking my questions. Congrats on the nice quarter. I have a question around the VR products. Obviously, given a lot of the social unrest, how have you seen demand trends early on for that? And thinking from a high level, given looking out two or three years, how do you see that product kind of growing and coming to market? And then, maybe also where you think that you fit in competitively? Thanks.\nJawad Ahsan: Yes. Why don\u2019t I start with that and then have Josh follow-up. So, the demand that we\u2019ve seen for VR, I would say, is nearly unprecedented, where customers are coming to us. We\u2019re explaining what our existing offering is with community agent scenarios, some of the future ideas that we\u2019re developing. And we\u2019ve seen a really, really healthy pipeline from all sized agencies, a lot of geographical distribution. So, we feel like this is one where there\u2019s a lot of demand.\nJosh Isner: Yes. I think that\u2019s right. I just want to be clear though. I\u2019m very cautious to attribute that to really anything except we\u2019re addressing a need that has existed for the last 20 years, it will exist in the next 20 years. And there aren\u2019t -- we can\u2019t control kind of year-to-year what the narrative is in the public or what\u2019s going on externally. So, for us, it\u2019s about building products that we think better and make our customers more effective and safer at their jobs, make communities safer. And we think VR is of that category. And we\u2019re super excited about this one. We see a lot of demand in the market. We see a lot of alignment with our mission long term. And this is one that -- it\u2019s a new category that we\u2019re really proud to be participating in. And we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s very focused and excited about scaling it over the next several years.\nAndrea James: We\u2019ll take our next question from Erik Lapinski at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Erik.\nErik Lapinski: Maybe going back to the Baltimore rollout of records. And just wondering as you\u2019re working through that, like what\u2019s the level of customization that a larger police department would be pushing forward with that? Like, is the product modular enough that you can kind of work around what they might want? I guess, just wondering like how that process goes and if it has altered the development path in any way from making it more customizable?\nRick Smith: Sure. No, great question. Inherently, not only for us but for everyone playing in any of these large complex enterprise software plays inside and outside of public safety, there is that advance. And I think for us, it was clear as we continue to go forward that we are really excited about that we\u2019re building the right pieces in the right order, as we keep building up the product and winning and working to delight our early customers. And as Josh said earlier today and as you\u2019ve heard me say on the last couple of calls, this is a multiyear journey for us, and we are determined in our path to ultimately become number one in these categories, but we also have evolutions it takes time. And it\u2019s one piece of our overall path of our sensors and software contributing more and more the full portfolio of scenarios that our customers need to be successful every day. So, we feel great about that rollout and about what -- what Baltimore\u2019s needs, and each of our early customers\u2019 needs are, apply all of the additional customers as we keep going.\nAndrea James: And we just got some feedback from the outside that Erik\u2019s question and John\u2019s maybe not that well heard. So, John Godin [ph] had asked about virtual reality, training. And Erik had asked about the level of customization required for Baltimore PD.\nErik Lapinski: If I can ask 1 more, too, just on international traction in bookings there. Is that primarily TASER right now, or are you also seeing it picking up with the body cam side? I think, the last time we\u2019ve asked on that, it was kind of TASER was really leading some of the international expansion, but wondering if body cam has followed?\nAndrea James: And the question is about what products -- just real quick, Josh. The question is about what products are driving our international bookings. Thanks, Josh. Go ahead.\nJosh Isner: Yes. Sorry about that. Absolutely. I think it\u2019s a great question. The good news is, we\u2019re seeing both. It depends on the market. Some markets, we lead with TASER. And then, we grow those into body cam customers in other markets and customers were leading with body cams and even [Technical Difficulty] without body cameras, which is a growing segment for us in international, where large customers, and we expect to see a couple of these in the next couple of quarters, buy software-only packages from us in high volumes. So we\u2019re particularly excited about that new trend that we\u2019re seeing. And so, we feel like we\u2019re really, really well positioned, just like in the United States, where we started with one product and have diversified and grown customers into adopting several of our products. We\u2019re seeing that same thing starting to happen in international.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Erik. Do any of our analysts have any follow-up questions? No? Okay. Well, thanks, guys, so much for joining us. We\u2019re going to have Rick close us out.\nRick Smith: Thanks, Andrea. Hey, before you leave, if you have time to stick around, we\u2019re going to play our quarterly earnings video. So, thanks for joining. We look forward to updating you throughout the year. We\u2019ll drop off after this video. And the webcast will be posted to investor.axon.com. Roll video.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrea, and hello, everyone. As you can see from the shareholder letter, we've had an exceptional start to the year. Our teams have remained heads down, executing on our mission and driving growth across all of our products and markets. I couldn't be more proud of what we've built of Axon's position as a true change agent and ultimately and most exciting, where we're heading. We've always been passionate about innovation, and the inherent drive continues to propel our business forward. Today, I'd like to address current events, public and personal that are relevant to our business. First, recent current events, including last year's death of George Floyd and the events that followed, forced our nation to reflect upon the values we hold true for all Americans. Axon is and will remain committed to creating technologies that save lives, increase transparency and help communities and public safety agencies who serve them, achieve a higher quality of life to ensure everyone makes it home safe. Customers and increasingly communities, see us as a key thought leader and key partner in the global drive to transform public safety. We hear stories daily about customers using our products to save lives and protect their communities. And we believe our problem-solving approach to these major challenges will continue to drive our growth. Two years ago when I published my book, The End of Killing, it was a radical idea that we can actually make the bullet obsolete and create less lethal weapons that could become the primary use of force and eventually displace lethal weapons. Customers were far more receptive to this idea than I could have anticipated. And in light of the events of the past 12 months, we are here pleased from our public safety customers and the broader community that they cannot wait until the deadline I had set at the end of this decade for us to achieve the goal of surpassing the sidearm and effectiveness. Our teams are working extremely hard to bring in the date for the next-generation of TASER weapons, which I believe will be the largest single leaping capability in the history of less lethal weapons. Customers have even begun signing 10-year programs with us to enable seamless upgrades, and we worked with them to create programs that will even allow them early upgrades when the next-generation launches. Now, to set expectation, the next-generation of TASER is a couple of years out due to the intense testing a ground-up new design requires, as well as the full production automation and scaling. But, I wanted to talk about the issue head on, given the growing intense public interest and to help our investors understand why you might be seeing this dynamic behind 10-year program? Second, on a personal note, the passing of my father, Phil Smith, our founding Chairman, last month, was a monumental loss. He was instrumental in helping to get TASER off the ground in its early days, and our Company would not exist without it. His final 24 hours were an amazing capstone to an incredible life. His mission lives on among all of us at Axon, and I will miss calling him after the call today to discuss the results. As we look to the future, Axon can be a huge force for progress through our vision of obsoleting the bullet, reducing social conflict, enabling a fair and effective justice system and building for racial equity, diversity and inclusion. Luke and Jawad will now take you through some more highlights of our business. That's my move, Keith. You're on mute. I got a patent on that. Yes. I'll touch on it. And then, Josh, I'll hand it off to you. I would say, there's really a shifting focus. 10 years ago, the focus with TASER, there was a lot of focus on sort of the medical safety of the devices. I think, we've come out of that, where now there's really an intense focus on effectiveness. And in my book, where I talked about, I'm very transparent. We are not yet reliable enough to be a substitute for lethal force, but we're heading that direction. We made a big step with TASER 7, and we'll make an even bigger step on our next launch. And I think our customers are pretty excited, and we're just seeing a lot of TASER 7 adoption that has really kind of picked up. We're also seeing, I think, broader international adoption. There's -- we're getting -- I see orders coming in our daily reports, and I got to go look at the map to see where some of these countries are that a few years ago, weren't even on our radar, and now we're getting much broader coverage. And with that, Josh, let me hand over to you. Thanks, Will. On the positive side, I hope to die the way he did. It was actually as positive and uplifting as such a thing could be. Josh? I'm sorry, what was it? I couldn't hear what product are you referring to, Will? I've got to add one more thing. And maybe we're too transparent sometimes. But with Fleet 1 and 2, we're scrapping, we have to get to market fast. The hardware was not our strength in those products. And we still got to, I think, the top end of the suppliers in the market.

It also is a great story around how we're able to provide not only the hardware but also the software and advanced software that the customers are willing to pay for it. Go ahead, Jeff. And then, lastly, I would just add, one of the benefits of really focusing on bookings as a forward-looking indicator of our results. Our bookings continue to grow year in and year out. And we saw that last year. We're seeing it this year as well. And we're very excited about what that means for the future. So, we certainly do between bringing on more and more enterprise sales talent that gets better and better at forecasting, combining that with having growing bookings year-over-year, it gives us a lot of confidence that we're going to keep growing. Certainly. We're really excited. We're seeing customers that have had a lot of confidence in us historically willing to partner with us more on our newer offerings. When we go into police departments, one of the questions we always ask is, what's the best piece of functioning software you deploy today? And oftentimes we hear it's Evidence.com. And that inspires a lot of confidence from our customers that the next piece of enterprise software we deliver is going to be equally good or better. And so, right now, we have to be very careful in terms of making sure that we set the right expectations. We bring on the right customers for us early on, and we make those customers really successful. And that's what we're focused on right now. And we believe just like we have in every category that we've entered, we turn those early evangelists into a growing market over the years to come, and we have a lot of confidence we're going to do that in our records and dispatch as well. Yes. I think that's right. I just want to be clear though. I'm very cautious to attribute that to really anything except we're addressing a need that has existed for the last 20 years, it will exist in the next 20 years. And there aren't -- we can't control kind of year-to-year what the narrative is in the public or what's going on externally. So, for us, it's about building products that we think better and make our customers more effective and safer at their jobs, make communities safer. And we think VR is of that category. And we're super excited about this one. We see a lot of demand in the market. We see a lot of alignment with our mission long term. And this is one that -- it's a new category that we're really proud to be participating in. And we've got a team that's very focused and excited about scaling it over the next several years. Yes. Sorry about that. Absolutely. I think it's a great question. The good news is, we're seeing both. It depends on the market. Some markets, we lead with TASER. And then, we grow those into body cam customers in other markets and customers were leading with body cams and even [Technical Difficulty] without body cameras, which is a growing segment for us in international, where large customers, and we expect to see a couple of these in the next couple of quarters, buy software-only packages from us in high volumes. So we're particularly excited about that new trend that we're seeing. And so, we feel like we're really, really well positioned, just like in the United States, where we started with one product and have diversified and grown customers into adopting several of our products. We're seeing that same thing starting to happen in international."

            "content": "Yes. Great question, Keith. I'll fill that. So, our supply chain and ops team is led by a phenomenal guy, named Josh Goldman. And over the last year, we've really put buffers in place to ensure that we can meet the quarterly demand, as well as forecast out critical components. And I've just got to give the team a lot of credit to have navigated the last 12 months, and we're keeping that same strategy looking forward. And as of today, we feel really good about it. Fleet. Yes. Just continuing on that. First and foremost, on the camera system itself, we're really proud and looking forward to shipping it to customers that is overwhelmingly our best camera system ever for the car. And we've -- just on those merits alone, that drives a lot of the demand that we're seeing. And then, as we've alluded to, one of the things that is Axon's greatest strength is how we combine these devices with the power of intelligent cloud services. And so, both, with our Respond live streaming connected and as well as our Vievu disruptively affordable and ethically designed from the ground up approach to ALPR really creates, for the first time, the ability for an agency to afford for the same budgets they're used to spending to put ALPR capability in every single vehicle. And so, you put all that together at an attractive overall price. And again, we still have -- we look forward to shipping it later this year and seeing how customers love it."

            "name": "Luke Larson",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. As stated in our shareholder letter, which we've got a ton of positive feedback on, shout out to our IR team, our teams are executing on our 2021 strategic priorities to grow our core, scale new products, unlock new markets and drive efficiency to fuel growth. We believe Axon has been at the forefront of change. But the past year, we've been put in the center of truly unprecedented events that inspired our teams to show up in many new ways. Our body cameras are capturing the most critical events in the world. We're proud of that. And it's a responsibility we take very seriously. During the civil unrest in the Capitol on January 6, for instance, DC Metropolitan Police and the Montgomery County Police who are Axon Body customers were called in for backup and the Justice Department has released Axon Body camera videos related to that incident. Axon Body cameras are also providing critical evidence in many of the current events that we're all familiar with. Just last week, NPR published a story about a team of public safety experts and world economists that says body-worn cameras are both, beneficial and cost-effective. The University of Chicago Crime Lab and the Council on Criminal Justice Task Force on Policing, released a report and stated the key benefit of body-worn cameras is the reduced use of police force. For example, among the police department study, they saw complaints against police dropped 17%, and this is really the compelling statistic is that use of force by police during fatal and nonfatal encounters fell by nearly 10%. Professor Jens Ludwig, Head of the Crime Lab, says, if you're a local government looking at adopting the cost from your narrow green eyeshade bottom line, the technology probably pays for itself and the benefits to the public are a huge win and easily outweigh the cost. Our focus as a management team is to invest in growth, so that we can continue delivering technologies to protect life and truce. In February, we outlined the capital investments we're making this year, including the TASER manufacturing, we have a great update to share on that front as you see in our shareholder letter. These investments are growing the TASER manufacturing capacity and driving gross margin expansion. This positions us to meet growing TASER demand globally and in our federal sector. So far this year, TASER device manufacturing and supply chain improvements are on track to deliver more than $4 million in gross cost savings in 2021. We are also excited about the momentum that we are seeing in our Software and Sensors segment. Later this year, we expect to launch our third-generation fleet solution. This is our dashboard cam solution, which features AI powered, automatic license plate recognition, known in the industry as ALPR. Demand for this premium fleet bundle, which includes ALPR software add-on and the live streaming off of our cameras is exceeding our expectations by a healthy margin, and you can read more about this in detail in our shareholder letter. We are also seeing growing adoption in the usage of LTE-enabled live streaming off of the body cameras and remote evidence uploads. And in the coming weeks, we expect to transition the Baltimore Police Department to our record solution, and the training and feedback has been going very well. Finally, we're transforming how agencies train their officers by addressing the inefficiencies around the classroom, role-playing and simulator training. By leveraging VR, we are addressing their two biggest issues, budget and time. In the coming days, we have an exciting product launch that we can't wait to tell you more about. We just did a sneak peak of our big VR announcement yesterday with TASER's training advisory board, and it was very well received. We have a lot to be excited about in 2021 and beyond. Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jawad. I think, I would just add to that. Just as Jawad talked about earlier, you can see that pattern in all of these very judicious investments we've made so far. So, between Flock Safety and then RapidSOS and then now with Cellebrite, all of them are -- yes, they're a financial investments, but they're very purposefully chosen to be a match for places where customers win as we do interesting things together commercially as well. And the investment is an accelerant to what we would otherwise want to naturally do as great partners."

            "name": "Jawad Ahsan",
            "content": "Thanks, Luke. As our teams continue to execute at an extremely high level, we're able to confidently invest in our future. Our strong balance sheet also gives us the flexibility to drive growth broadly across products, markets and geographies. We've recently made three strategic investments in Flock Safety, RapidSOS and Cellebrite, as well as expanded our strategic partnerships. These were carefully crafted moves that allow us to extend our platform as we aim to build the public safety ecosystem of the future. In Q1, we invested $20 million in RapidSOS and more recently completed a strategic partnership. When people dial 911, lives are literally in the balance when the call center doesn't know where they are. RapidSOS is a leader in solving this problem. For example, if you call 911 today, using your iPhone, in the vast majority of U.S. jurisdictions, Apple will send your location to public safety via RapidSOS. Now, the location and live streams of Axon Body cameras and Axon Fleet cameras can be integrated into the RapidSOS platform, and RapidSOS data can be integrated into our new Axon Respond dispatching platform. Another recent investment in strategic partnership includes a $90 million participation in a PIPE transaction in connection with Cellebrite going public by a SPAC IPO. Cellebrite is the market leader in digital intelligence. Their software complements our lead in digital evidence management, and they share our strong emphasis on safeguards to protect privacy. We are consistently hearing great feedback from our customers in common with Cellebrite, and the company has been delivering compelling results. This partnership will make Evidence.com even more valuable for our customers. From an M&A perspective, as you can see, we're taking a deliberate approach to how we partner and deploy our capital. You can expect to see us continue to be opportunistic and make strategic moves that strengthen and extend our platform. To be clear, we will be highly selective. Our continued strong execution allows us to make these types of investments and keep our strategic focus on investing for growth. However, it's really the fact that we always lead with our mission to protect life, truce in the communities we serve that has us taking a long-term view on our business. As we work towards goals such as obsoleting the bullet, we are measuring our progress over a longer term horizon. In fact, we'd like to invite you to think about our business the way that we do in terms of years and not quarters. This is why today, we are introducing two-year revenue guidance for both, 2021 and 2022. For 2021, we are raising our revenue guidance by $40 million at the midpoint to $800 million. In 2022, our early view of the year anticipates that we will deliver approximately $920 million in revenue. The combination of positive underlying demand trends and our strategic growth and expansion initiatives gives us tremendous confidence in our longer term outlook. We've been making investments in several new geographies outside of the U.S. and many of these investments are starting to yield results. The nature of the international market is such that the deals are often for larger regions or entire nations. The larger and more complex nature of these deals makes their timing difficult to forecast and thus, growth is not as linear as we might expect in the U.S. We, therefore, expect the phasing of revenue from international deals to contribute to variability in our quarterly revenue, a trend we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. This is why we're anchoring on annual revenue guidance. We don't want the timing of large international deals to signal anything about the underlying growth rate of our business. We are laser-focused on building a business that will sustainably grow at a 20%-plus CAGR. I want to reiterate that we are committed to continuing to execute and invest with rigor and discipline. As such, and given our strength and outlook for the year, we're raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 by $12.5 million at the midpoint. We're also maintaining our long-term target adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%, while continuing to invest for growth. I'd like to close by highlighting another aspect of Axon that I'm particularly proud of. How diversified we've become. We sell hardware and software, solutions and services, products and training. We've diversified geographically as well as to the types of customers we sell to. Revenues from our market-leading tailored devices and body cameras remain on a strong growth trajectory, while our ARR has now surpassed $240 million and is expected to grow approximately $15 million per quarter. I've never felt better about how Axon is positioned for growth, and I'm looking forward to seeing how our team continues to deliver. And with that, Andrea, let's move to questions. Yes. I'd like to start with that, and would love to hear Josh's input as well. So, there are a couple of factors, Jonathan. The first one is, look, quite frankly, the business is rocking and rolling. We've got -- you've heard us allude to it. We've collected a pretty fantastic collection of talent in all of our functions, and they are executing crisply and reliably. And I have a tremendous amount of confidence in them. The pipeline that we've built, I feel like we've got a very high likelihood that we're going to execute on that to such a degree that I feel confident going out two years on our guidance. The second factor is -- and we've also alluded to this, is that these international deals, it makes it difficult for us to give quarter-to-quarter guidance. It's better for us to think in terms of years. Because they're larger, they're more complex, there's so many more factors involved, financial, operational, regulatory, political. And really, we think about the business in terms of years. And what we're working towards is to build a business that will sustainably grow at a 20%-plus CAGR year-over-year. Yes. I'll start. So, Cellebrite is a company that we've been admiring from a far for some time now. We had a chance to build a relationship with them prior to the SPAC deal coming on our radar. It's someone we really admired. As we talk about, they're a leader in digital intelligence. We think it's a very natural extension of our lead in digital evidence management. And this is a long-term play. We really view our partnership with them as strategically important to Axon. And we'll evaluate the opportunity to invest more or something beyond that going forward. But, at this point, we feel really good about where we're at. Yes. So, one of the things that Josh alluded to is for us, the leading indicator is really bookings. And we're right now, just like we've made investments in new international markets, we're also making investments in these new product categories, like records and dispatch. And we're in the very early innings. We're building a product that we're very proud of. And we think it's going to be a market leader. And so, the leading indicator for us is going to be bookings. As those bookings come in, we think that will just continue to add that will end up translating into ARR. Yes. Why don't I start with that and then have Josh follow-up. So, the demand that we've seen for VR, I would say, is nearly unprecedented, where customers are coming to us. We're explaining what our existing offering is with community agent scenarios, some of the future ideas that we're developing. And we've seen a really, really healthy pipeline from all sized agencies, a lot of geographical distribution. So, we feel like this is one where there's a lot of demand."

        "content": "Andrea James: Okay. Welcome, everyone, to our Q4 2022 Update. I hope you've all had a chance to read our shareholder letter at investor.axon.com. Our prepared remarks today are meant to build on the information and tables in that very robust letter. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made today are pursuant to and within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today and are not guarantees of future performance.

And before we turn the call over to Rick, we will play our quarterly earnings video, go ahead and settle in. It's about a 10-minute video.\nRick Smith: All right. Thank you, Andre and Angel. Great job. And to our investors, I hope you can feel the passion that comes through in that video. And I'm just so humbled to be a part of this team. And the formula is really work for us is when we focus on one of the most important problems we can solve that gets us solving the things that are also the most valuable problems for our customers. And that ultimately is what puts up the results that you see from last year. So TASER 10 is the most sophisticated, accurate and effective TASER energy weapon we've ever created. It's a huge leap forward.  Future generations may simply take for granted the existence of these truly capable less lethal technologies as if they had always existed. And like all technological advancements that drive our society forward, that is our goal. Now the customer reception has been fantastic. We are incredibly humbled to be at the forefront of breakthrough technology and societal change. Our 2022 standout performance with revenue up 38% and strong profitability and cash flow follows multiple years of exceptional results even through difficult macro environments. Axon's history of superior execution can be traced to a few key things: our vision and mission; our long-term strategic thinking, and that attracts just an amazing team of passionate and talented people and our relentless focus on customers, we build upon a solid foundation of customer trust. And finally, our conviction to double down on investments to drive unprecedented change and cumulative growth.  A prime example of this is the foresight we had more than a decade ago to start building a software business. In 2022, our recurring high-margin cloud revenue comprised more than 30% of the company total. It's great to see our long-term strategies continuing to be a -- to that end, I'll take a moment to talk about areas where we're currently investing to ensure that Axon continues to drive value creation well beyond the 2025 planning horizon we're sharing today. The future policing will include more robotic security, full stop.  We stood up our Axon Air program a few years ago, and we continue to invest in that. We view drone and robotics technology, first and foremost, as a way to extend visibility and communications for first responders. Robotic security is already playing an increasingly important role in search and revenue natural disaster response, crime and accident scene reconstruction and a new category of DFR or drone as a first responder. We see potential for robotic security to play a greater role in de-escalation. Numerous high-profile cases. We've all seen these tragedies on the news have inspired police departments to do everything possible to reduce the frequency of use of force incidents. Substituting a robot for a human can help in many types of scenarios. One example is high-risk entry with SWAT teams. We see the opportunity to reduce the need for people as police officers to enter a home with firearms drawn, for example. Another area we see coming is the fusion of intelligent ecosystems that integrate with public safety. How long video for multiple types of cameras and sensors to port into one system, both to assist in real-time response and to support investigations. We're also excited about these recent advances in generative AI and Nearly 6 years ago, we published a vision video with the idea that artificial intelligence could one day extract key information from body camera videos, which, together with a brief oral description from the officer can be used to write the police report for that officer.  Well, that vision no longer feels like science fiction. This vision was part of our thesis and our focus in building out our cloud infrastructure over the past decade, and we are excited to see what capabilities we will be able to leverage over the next few years to delight our customers and to make our public tax dollars much more efficient by automating many mundane yet very time-consuming tasks. And finally, when we build for the future, we collaborate with our trusted constituencies. We work with governments, city councils, public safety and our Ethics and Equity Advisory Council. This council provides invaluable feedback. They ask us the hard questions and help us to see around corners. We look to them for assistance in ensuring ethical design and that we continue to work with our counsel leaders who are each dynamic, highly successful and impressive individuals in their own right. And with that, I'd now like to turn over to our COO, Josh Isner, to talk in more detail about the business. Josh?\nJosh Isner: Thanks a lot, Rick. Last August, I talked about four major areas of focus for the back half of 2022. And I'm pleased to report that we delivered on all fronts. First, we are driving discipline and prioritization across the business. We say no to many opportunities. And when we do say yes, we win. The results of our efforts include a phenomenal close to the year with revenue up 44% in the back half and more than 50% in Q4 alone. And then a game-changing product launch of TASER 10 just a few weeks later.  The second area I talked about was investing to penetrate our total addressable market. In our shareholder letter today, we introduced a new TAM analysis which outlines a $50 billion opportunity and shows growth in our core markets. That core TAM, which includes our SaaS categories, cameras, professional TASER, Axon Air, VR and a customer base that includes U.S. federal, international and commercial enterprises grew from $34 billion to $45 billion in our updated analysis. Much of the TAM we pursue today is in areas where our investments have helped position us as a leader and as a pioneer. We see ourselves as the best positioned to deliver on the future of policing that Rick discussed a moment ago.  Thirdly, I'm very pleased to see us deliver on our promise to generate strong cash flow. For the full year, we delivered $195 million in adjusted free cash flow. This was an 84% conversion on adjusted EBITDA of $232 million. This allowed us to maintain a net cash position roughly flat to last year, while investing CapEx to drive global scale in deploying $83 million in strategic ecosystem investments to ensure we stay at the forefront of industry innovation. Finally, we are assembling a world-class team from top to bottom, some of whom you see on the call here today.  This team brings financial discipline, a next play mindset and the capability to drive outside outcomes for the next 5 years and beyond. We are building a culture where we expect to deliver on our commitments to employees, to customers and to our investors. Looking forward to 2023, Working with Britney, we have streamlined our company-wide bonus metrics to four core items. The entire organization is incentivized to measure, drive toward and exceed the following: number one, revenue. Top line growth remains a top priority. Number two, adjusted EBITDA margin, which Bindi will take you through in a moment. Number three, new market expansion in the U.S. federal government and international markets and number four, new product adoption, ensuring that the products we are building continue to be adopted and used by our customers.  We never stopped helping our existing customer base to walk up the value chain and take advantage of our new software features. Finally, before bringing lays out our 3-year plan to achieve $2 billion in revenue, I wanted to provide some color on what we think will help us build toward that milestone. Our path to $2 billion in revenue and beyond will be driven by a combination of selling new products into our existing markets and by selling existing products into new markets. We continue to introduce new products that deliver value to our existing customer base of U.S. state and local law enforcement, and we believe we will continue to grow our share of wallet in that market. Items such as TASER 10, Fleet 3, virtual reality, Axon Records, Axon Dispatch, Axon Air and the multitude of Evidence.com add-ons will continue to drive growth amongst our state and local US customers. In parallel, we will continue to grow international, federal and enterprise, leveraging our core product portfolio. Not only will the combination of these two simultaneous motions create top line growth opportunities for the future, well beyond 2025, but they will also provide multiple paths to our annual revenue guidance year in and year out.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Brittany.\nBrittany Bagley: Thank you, Josh. It's particularly gratifying to see broad-based strength across the business and our strong 2022 execution. Both software and hardware are driving robust performance. Notably, Axon Cloud now represents about one third of our business, carrying best-in-class metrics on growth and net revenue retention. In 2022, cloud revenue grew 50% to $368 million with a 73% gross margin. Annual recurring revenue has grown to $473 million and the net revenue retention is 121%.  In addition, we are incredibly proud of the fantastic job Axon has done selling hardware and subscription bundles. 9% of total revenue in 2022 was tied to a subscription compared to just a few years ago when less than half of revenue was subscription-based. Following on Josh's commentary regarding the GAM opportunity, our updated analysis more closely aligns with our focus as an organization. Axon's core TAM of $45 billion across SaaS categories cameras, professional TASER, Axon Air and VR reflects opportunities and a customer base includes public safety, U.S. federal, international and commercial enterprise. At the same time, the consumer personal protection market remains an opportunity, and I'm currently recruiting for a permanent GM to lead the business. However, as we noted in our shareholder letter, we are refarming our analysis on this market from $18 billion to $5 billion in terms of total TAM.  Almost $5 billion is still large opportunity that we're interested in pursuing, but we are rightsizing our focus to better reflect the normal opportunity we see in our core business. You'll also note that in Q4, we recognized $8.5 million of cloud revenue that we had previously underreported. This revenue relates to work that was completed in prior periods and was unrecognized due to our ERP implementation in 2021. While the impact is immaterial to our financials, it did result in a material weakness. Remediating this will be a focus in 2023, and we have laid out a detailed plan in our 10-K. Against the backdrop of an exceptional 2022 and an improving demand environment, we are thrilled to be sharing another robust outlook for the year ahead. Additionally, now that I've had some time to dig into the business, we are introducing 3-year financial goals. Looking at 2023, my key financial priorities for the year are the following: first, executing against our financial objective of delivering revenue growth of 20%. Second, working towards long-term gross margin improvement. We feel confident in the levers we can pull on gross margin over time, which include investing in automation, improving manufacturing efficiency further growing our software revenue mix and offsetting inflation with pricing. In 2023, we are balancing these opportunities against ramping TASER 10 in the first half of the year, and continuing to catch up on our fleet in-car camera installations.  Our Fleet business carries a lower margin upfront and transitions to high-margin recurring software revenue over time. Third, controlling operating expenses by enhancing our financial discipline. In 2023, we are still digesting large investments we made in 2022 and investing for growth. We are guiding to 20% adjusted EBITDA margin, which implies 50 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Fourth, delivering on our ecosystem vision by leveraging strategic partnerships, investments and potentially M&A. And fifth, setting us up to ensure we are on the path to hitting our 3-year goals.  Turning to those goals. Our 2025 outlook for more than $2 billion in revenue is underpinned by our confidence that we can deliver on the 20% CAGR that we've communicated previously, and as Josh laid out the drivers. Over the next three years, we also expect to drive gross margins and leverage our operating expenses to achieve approximately 25% adjusted EBITDA margins. We are excited to demonstrate the increasing profitability of the business, and this represents significant expansion of more than 500 basis points. We are also focusing on cash flow and through prudent management of working capital and CapEx, we are targeting adjusted free cash flow conversion above 60% on adjusted EBITDA.  This allows us to both invest in our business and deliver attractive free cash flow generation. Finally, we have heard you on share count dilution. And while we will spend the next few years working through existing stock comp expenses, we are committing to bring our dilution down on a go-forward basis. Personally, I'm incredibly energized by the runway we see over the next three years. Axon enjoys a compelling business model, delivering subscriptions to a stable and growing end user market. We enjoy low global TAM penetration, strong customer relationships, and innovative R&D capabilities that are building solutions to meet a critical market need.  With that, I would like to open it up to questions.\nA - Andrea James: Okay. Thank you. And do we have everyone in gallery view? Sami Badri from Credit Suisse.\nSami Badri: Just have a couple. First one is for Rick. I think Brent just mentioned that TASER 10 is going to be ramping up in 2023. But one thing I think that you laid out in the video is just the feature set and what TASER 10 actually proposes to a lot of your customers would there be customers that feel very strongly about maybe an early shipment or an early refresh of their actual TASER nonlethal weapon, or would they have to stick to kind of the plan or subscription type time line that they've already signed and are subscribed to?\nRick Smith: Well, great question. I would say I have never seen demand this strong in a new TASER launch in my history in the business, which is great news. The subscription model does already have our customers on an upgrade pathway, but I'm working closely with Britney and Josh on a customer-by-customer basis, and we are getting a lot of increase for people that want to upgrade early. And so obviously, the revenue accounting on the -- on our contracts with the multiple deliveries is a bit complex. So we're taking those on a case-by-case basis. But we believe that overall, we will be able to find ways to accommodate customers to be able to take early upgrades in ways that also work for our shareholders and that are profitable for us and help our customers get this capability sooner without the need for any big onetime expenditures by just being able to bring forward and adjust and obviously, we hope they'll also upgrade to some of our other new capabilities that we're launching some of our new VR and other things. So we think this really -- the business model continues to set up a win-win for us and our customers. And one great example is the ability for us to accelerate the upgrade cycles.\nSami Badri: Got it. Next one is for Josh. Josh, you talked about how compensation will be measured by four key drivers. One of the drivers was actually selling other products or cross-selling. Will that include ecosystem partners that are part of your Axon cloud feature set also being pulled through in the sales motion? Or is that very isolated to just Axon products and services?\nJosh Isner: Yes. Great question, Sam. I'd say any time we're a sales agent, there is a revenue impact when we sell through a partner's product. But to set expectations, I think that will be a relatively small part of our overall revenue for next year. So it's part of it. And then when you look at the rep level commission plans, we do have a new product sales team that is essentially compensated in large part in momentum of both new products and partner sales. So that's how we solve for that.\nSami Badri: Got it. And then one last one for Brittany. I'm burning for the 500 basis points of expansion by 2025. Is this going to be back half loaded across these three years just because of the comment you made regarding some of the products, well, the comments you made and the comments made in the actual press release regarding margin neutrality for some of these products. And then as they ramp up with software, does that [indiscernible]\nAndrea James: I think Sami froze, but I think we got the gist of this question, so we can answer it.\nBrittany Bagley: Yes. So I'm taking the gist of the question to be when might we get to that 25% margin. And we're really looking to make sure we get there by 2025, Sami, like there are a bunch of those puts and takes that we're looking at both for 2023. And certainly, part of getting to the OpEx leverage that we've talked about is getting to that $2 billion in revenue. And so we need to pull those levers, and it's nice that we have multiple different levers to get there, both from a gross margin and an OpEx standpoint.\nAndrea James: Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Congratulations on the strong results. I guess I wanted to dig a little bit more into your comments about what's underpinning your confidence for the 2025 guidance. Is there something that's maybe changed with some of your market assumptions or one part of the business that's proving stronger than you anticipated to give you that extra degree of confidence to extend that 20% guidance?\nJosh Isner: Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. Actually, I think it's very much that we have a lot of confidence in all of our product categories and market categories that continue to grow significantly year-over-year. And as I'm sure you're aware, we talked about in the past that we do measure five-year normalized in as kind of a forward-looking indicator of what revenue will look like into the future and not only on a gross basis, but on a year-over-year basis, and we continue to be optimistic about the results we're seeing and the 5-year bookings growth in that 5-year bookings growth rate.  And so it's a combination of seeing a lot of really exciting indicators in our new markets, seeing our new product scale and seeing some of the reinforcements in terms of future revenues that the look into bookings provide.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent, excellent. And then just with regards to the TASER 10 pace of adoption, can you remind us what happened when TASER 7 was released? Do you worry at all about maybe customers delaying orders to purchase the 10 million. Just wondering if there's any sort of linearity that we may worry about here just given the step function improvements that you've made or above step function improvements.\nJosh Isner: Yes, absolutely. Without going into too much detail there, I think the 10 forecast is exceeding year one of the TASER 7 actuals from five years ago. So we're encouraged to see that and it speaks to the value and utility of the product. I would say that it's something we're managing very closely in terms of both early upgrades and new customer shipments. And it provides certainly on path to meet our guidance for the year. We're going to exceed our guidance for the year, but there are several paths toward that goal as well. So we don't want to get too far out over our skis here.  We want to make sure that the product we ship is a very high quality one that scales very well in the field. And as we do that, we'll certainly continue to ship all the other high-demand products that we offer to combine for a really nice year this year.\nAndrea James: Next question, Eric Suppiger from JMP.\nErik Suppiger: So a couple of questions here. First off, it looks like your TASER revenue was down sequentially I'm curious, was there any reason for that? And conversely, the Axon Cloud and the sensor revenues were up sharply. What was causing that? And I think you had some supply chain constraints that were a factor last quarter. What happened with those various dynamics?\nJosh Isner: Yes, absolutely. I think it's just timing of shipments and orders. And I think toward the end of the year as we looked at the year and the upcoming product launch. We wanted to be thoughtful about with a product launch a couple of years away, just maintaining flexibility for our customers as we knew some might be interested in the next one. And so we tried to manage that as best we could.  And we're very excited to see the supply chain opening up on fleet. I think you'll notice that was a big item in terms of the volume of fleet that shipped in Q4. We expect that to continue throughout the year. We mentioned some of the supply chain challenges historically. We're cautiously optimistic that we're past kind of most of the storm there and feeling good about having the opportunity to ship certainly record-breaking amounts of Fleet 3 this year and of course, plenty of tasers, body cameras and some of our other solutions as well.\nErik Suppiger: Okay. And then your -- can you give us a general idea of how much of your installed base has been migrated to the TASER 7 at this point?\nJosh Isner: I don't have the exact number in front of me, but I'd say over the last year, in terms of the amount of CW shipped, TASER 7 was above 80% to 85% of the total there. So I think that speaks to the fact that much of the market had moved over from our legacy smart weapons into TASER 7. And now we have the opportunity to, of course, upgrade all of our early TASER 7 customers. But as Rick mentioned, I think there'll be some that are more recent that will be interested as well. So we're very excited to get as many case tens out there as we can.\nAndrea James: Keith Housum at Northcoast.\nKeith Housum: As we look at the kind of coming out, first off, you guys announced a specific data that's going to be deployed. And then second, if we look at past rollouts of the TASER weapons, there's obviously has been some challenges in terms of the gross margin recognition in those first few quarters. So perhaps you guys going to address steps you guys have taken over the past several years to identify and address the bot issue and what you guys are doing different with this rollout to protect your gross margins.\nBrittany Bagley: I think it goes to everything from how we design the product to how we design our manufacturing capabilities. We've talked about how when we get to scale, which will happen in the second half of the year. So we are calling it out as a little bit of a potential headwind in the first half of the year. But as we get to the second half of the year, it will be gross margin neutral. And I think the team learned a lot from the T7 launch and took those learnings into T10 and we're thoughtful and careful on the gross margin front.\nRick Smith: It's a little bit there. The Fleet is the first major product to launch under the new regime with Hansberitz running our R&D and John Graf and his team running engineering and building in and others and NPI. And basically, what we saw with Fleet, we injected probably six to 12 months of additional prerelease testing to really validate the product. And that paid off in a big way where Fleet 3 is a very sophisticated product, but it's had among the lowest out-of-the-box return rates and customer bugs reported of any product we've ever shipped and TASER 7 -- I'm sorry, TASER 10 went through very similar. It has been in testing with a highly automated production line for probably 6 to 9 months leading into the launch year. So the level of testing compared to previously when we were maybe a less mature company and still making that transition from the more entrepreneurial days. that there's just a lot more time, effort and expense that goes into the upfront testing, but that is paying dividends in the stability and reliability at which we're able to scale these without some of the challenges we had with T7 in particular, come to mind.\nKeith Housum: Great. And has the restart shipping?\nJosh Isner: As on TASER 10 will start shipping in March. .\nKeith Housum: In March. Okay. And then just if I could, Brian, perhaps you put the context or color regarding the convertible note offering you guys did in terms of plans that you guys have to use that cash?\nBrittany Bagley: Yes, of course. One, I would say, as you can tell, because it's been a little bit of time. Now it was very much opportunistic from our side to strengthen the balance sheet and to give ourselves a bit more flexibility from a capital standpoint. And we think we found a time to get attractive terms in the market. So we're very pleased that we were able to proactively get ahead of that. And then I think you heard me talk about how we have been investing in our ecosystem partners, how we might potentially consider M&A as we look going forward. And so we want to make sure that when we find something that is appealing from an M&A standpoint that we're able to be on our front foot and move quickly and smartly going forward on that.  We spent a lot of time on that convertible offering talking about what might we look for from an M&A standpoint because that was top of everybody's mind. And so a little color is, I think, if you look at our M&A history historically, that's probably a pretty good indication where we're really looking for either technology or talent that will support our future product road map and/or our moonshot goals and mission.\nBrittany Bagley: Paul Chung at JPMorgan.\nPaul Chung: So just another follow-up on kind of the pace of operating leverage through 2025. The pace accelerates a bit in '24 and '25 to get to that 25%. How do we think about the OpEx base kind of relative to gross margin expansion? And longer term, can you still get to that 30% mark you've mentioned in the past?\nBrittany Bagley: Yes. So I think we're really looking at the 3-year guidance that not to say we might not get to 30% at some point. But I think this is really meant to sort of replace that and like, okay, we have a plan in a concrete way to get to 25% by 2025, and then we'll start looking out from beyond there in terms of where we will go.  So I wouldn't say we're calling that, but maybe we're phasing that out and focusing on what is actionable and in front of us and what we really see a path to right now, and that's the 25% in 2025. I think you are correctly interpreting that we've got some puts and takes in 2023. And so we're not putting a stake in the ground specifically on any 2023 gross margin guidance. But we do expect to see both improvement on gross margin and OpEx leverage to get to that 25%. Perhaps over time with a little bit more under our belts, we be able to quantify the pieces a bit more.  But for right now, we're just really looking on driving both of those together to hit that 25%. And again, it's about 50 basis points of leverage in 2023. So you are all correctly picking up on more of that improvement will come in '24 and '25.\nPaul Chung: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on cash flow. Can you expand on kind of the big upside relative to prior guide and you're above your target kind of conversion rate this year are back in 2022? And then how do we think about free cash flow conversion in '23 and the puts and takes there? And is at least 60% conversion longer term, somewhat conservative given the tough macro backdrop, you guys hit 80% plus mark. Is that -- can we be at that 8% mark pretty consistently?\nBrittany Bagley: Yes. No, those are all excellent questions. I might go in reverse order, which is I don't want to say that we'll be at that 80% plus consistently. We're really -- we're looking to be at that 60% plus consistently. And the reason that we're there rather than the 80% plus, even though we did a phenomenal job on free cash flow generation this year is -- if you look at '21, I would say we did a less phenomenal job on free cash flow generation. And so if you look at sort of '21 and '22 together, you actually get back to that roughly 60, 65-ish percent free cash flow generation on average between those two years.  And some of the things that lead to that are investing in working capital and investing in inventory as we continue to grow our hardware business, continuing to invest in CapEx like automation. We have a number of those puts and takes that we've looked at and based on places that we are investing in our cash flow. We really think that, that 60% target on an annual basis is what we're looking for, might mean we do better some years. But I think as you look over a 3-year period, and as we've looked back, that's probably the right expectation level to set. While we are growing at the kind of rates we're growing at.  So if we are growing at 20% plus anymore, would we revisit that free cash flow target? Yes, certainly. But at those types of top line growth rate, we think that's the right balance in terms of what we're flowing through.\nAndrea James: Will Power at Baird.\nWilliam Power: I've got a couple of questions. I guess I'm going to start with TS-1, probably for either Rick or Josh work, I guess, a little over a month past TASERCon. I wonder if you have any additional feedback comments you could share from agencies that have been using the device in the field, any comments around level of use, effectiveness, et cetera.  And I guess the second part would just be with regard to supply chain components for both the devices and cartridges as we move through the year here. A - Rick Smith So I'll start off. We continue to get great feedback from the field. I think we've now had something approaching 40 or so different uses. I think we've had -- the one that I mentioned at TASERCon, where it was fired at a running situation at something like 40 feet and the person stumble forward. and the wires broke, but the agency then closed in the other offset of TASER 7. So ultimately, TASER on the day in that use. We categorize that as a partial effectiveness of the T10. And then we did have only one other case where it was not effective, and that was one where it was in quarter use an offered the first dart and turn out the second officer had not been trained on the TASER 10 yet and actually ran in and got between the operator and the subject before we part second art. And so one of the things we took away from that is actually making sure we work with our partners that they train all officers and how the new system functions. So the good news is we're continuing to see very high effectiveness. We -- since TASERCON, we presented to the major city chiefs and the Major County sheriffs with just very significant interest across the board. I talked to one major county sheriff that has had a fair number of shootings already this year with farms, and they basically ran through with me of the cases they've had this year, they think Azure 10 could have changed the outcome in every one of them, which was a pretty remarkable statement.  And I was actually with another major city chief today that told me in her agency, she thinks TASER 10 could have alleviated about one third of their shooting as she enumerated them. So we're continuing to get very positive feedback. I'm about to go on an international tour to the first one I'll do since the TASER TAM launch and start talking to some international customers. Where I think that might be the greatest growth potential internationally because internationally, we don't see many agencies individually issuing TASERs the way they do in the United States.  But TASER 10 could reach a level of capability where it could become the primary defensive weapon. And I think that means in many countries where they don't have many guns in the hands of the public ones are carrying the firearm. In those countries, we might actually see them begin to move to TASER 10 as their primary weapon on very clear. We're going to see that happening in the US.because of the gun culture and the ready availability of firearms and the general public, they will continue to carry both but this enhanced capability in different countries could really be a market-expanding phenomenon. And then what was the second part of your question? I think I was going to let Josh take it.\nJosh Isner: Yes, it was just about component availability, I think. Is that right, Will?\nWilliam Power: Yes, supply chain components, both for devices and cartridges, what does that look like?\nJosh Isner: Yes, absolutely. So our supply chain team, as always, has just done a fantastic job staying ahead of the curve in what are less challenging times than maybe a year or two ago, but any time you launch a new product, there are a lot of provisions and moving parts leading up to that. And ultimately, we feel really good about our capacity not only this year, but continuing to build out our automation capabilities to more exponentially expand our capacity into the future. And so certainly, we have plenty of inventory to support our revenue guidance and beyond for this year and next year, we're aggressively planning for even higher demand.\nWilliam Power: Okay. Great. If I could just add a question on software, continued strong traction across Axon Cloud. Maybe kind of two parts there, too. What's kind of driving the continued DIMs adoption? It feels like that continues to accelerate, I guess, in some respects. And I guess, in tandem with that, maybe just any kind of update what you're seeing with respect to records and other products out of kind of the core evidence category?\nJosh Isner: Maybe I'll start with the dentist question and then hand it over to Jeff for records. But the reason I want to take this one will is to give Jeff a huge shout out for the work he's done over the last few years. He's essentially built a team that not only has delivered on the core ecosystem, but continues to build out the last mile types of features and products that make the product, not only that much more valuable to our core market, but also more attractive to our kind of up-and-coming markets in federal and international. And so his team has just done a great job continuing to identify opportunity and market needs and then executing well on the plan to deliver those capabilities and just that flywheel continues to lend itself to more customer interest and more happy customers that will buy more over time. And so that's been the backbone of our dems adoption. And maybe Jeff, I'll take it over to you on records.\nRick Smith: Sure. No, that's awesome to hear and I couldn't agree more about the power of everything we've done to continue to make the overall suite more attractive, both in aggregate and in the piece parts. And I think just building on what Josh said, that also combines with the power of our OSP flywheel model because as we continue to both add new capabilities into the bundles and ad where appropriate new tiers of the bundle that just makes it, again, easier and easier for agencies to make one simple choice to get access to this very Amazon Prime or Microsoft College basket of both hardware and software benefits that they buy at a price that feels great to them even for the subset of the components that they know they want to use upfront.  And then as they go forward, all those additional benefits of basket feel free because they've already made the what feels to them like a good deal price for the basket and that drives the flywheel. And on top of that, who aren't yet in those programs, all a care are more and more and more seeing the value of those add-ons and incrementally growing ARPU as well as adding new logos. On the record side, again, we continue to be both humble and really excited and optimistic about the continued growth and trajectory. Just sort of using the same numbers we've talked to you about over the last couple of quarters. with growth. Now we have over 50 agencies that represent over almost 18,000 sworn officers live on at least record one module of Axon Records. And that includes now 16 agencies who are already using the product to fully replace their legacy RMS. And that includes, at this point, major cities such as Tucson and Baltimore, Virginia Beach and Fresno.\nAndrea James: We have three analysts left in the queue and [indiscernible]\nJosh Isner: AJ, just real quick, I think will deserve a shout out for the best T-shirt on the call today. That's the 10 shops and 45 feet from the TASER 10. So great fashion sense.\nAndrea James: So we have three analysts left in the queue, and we're happy to go past the top of the hour, so we can make sure we get to everyone. We love the engagement. Jeremy Hamblin, at Craig Hallum.\nJeremy Hamblin: Congrats on all the momentum in the business. So I just want to start with a high-level question. In terms of thoughts around M&A, strategic investments, you guys have a pretty robust balance sheet, that has been building I wanted to get a sense on terms of what you might be looking at on a go-forward basis in terms of scale, size of potential opportunities, whether it's strategic investment or M&A? And then to get a sense, are there any guidelines that you're looking at in terms of whether or not a deal is accretive or dilutive Obviously, you've kind of changed some of the viewpoints on stock-based comp and so forth, so to reduce future dilution. I wanted to get a sense for how you guys are looking at that.\nBrittany Bagley: Yes. No, it's a great question. For us, it really is about either vending technology or teams that fit in well with our mission and/or our business model. And so there are multiple parameters that we are looking to evaluate companies on. And so it's always sort of a multifaceted equation for us as we think through them. That's not to say that we aren't looking at whether or not something is financially attractive to us. but it could be across different metrics. It could significantly increase our TAM.  It could help us get conviction on supporting that 20% growth long, long, long term? Or it could be accretive to our gross margins or EBITDA margins. So there isn't sort of one set of things we're looking at, but we're really looking at ways that we can find companies that tuck into our ecosystem. We're looking to really integrate the technology and present a holistic Axon solution as we look forward. And then I'll just note that, that dilution number is really sort of an organic dilution number. So I think we have a strong balance sheet. I think we can certainly use cash for that. If we were going to use equity, I would consider that separately from what we're doing from just an internal stock comp expense standpoint.\nJeremy Hamblin: Great. That's helpful. Then a couple of product questions. So first, coming back to TASER 10. I wanted to get a sense, you offered some guidelines around bundled pricing. But wanted to get an understanding for versus the TASER 7, what your kind of net ASP might look like on a go-forward basis vis-a-vis kind of 10% higher ASP.  Obviously, there may be higher cartridge use given the product. So that's one on the TASER 10. And then secondly, you had a pretty massive quarter in Axon Fleet. I think, by far, almost double what you've ever done in a quarter. In fact, almost as much as you've done in many years. So I wanted to just get an understanding of -- was that a couple of really big orders? Or is there something specific to that product that you've really gained traction and now maybe we're past certain life cycles on prior contracts where you guys are just gaining more share? Any color there would be super helpful.\nJosh Isner: Yes, absolutely. Thanks a lot for the question. Nice to see you, Jeremy. On TASER 10 ASPs, we're not going to get too prescriptive there, but I'd say you should expect an uplift over previous generations and -- that's part due to the hand price and also part due to the number of cartridges in the bundle relative to previous models. And so I think we published the list prices on the website, so you can kind of derive from that what type of uplift to it will be in our bundles. So there'll be a slight inherent discount associated with any product in a bundle, but at a high level, that's kind of the story with TASER 10. And then with Fleet 3, no outsized orders like just a lot of volume, and you should expect that to continue and and maybe even higher levels this year.  The product has great product market fit. It's a well-built, well-designed product. the ALPR functionality associated with it is in high demand. ALPR is one of our fastest-growing software add-ons across the business. I think historically, you might remember our Fleet One system, which was more or less a body cam attached to a windshield and then fleet two was the moment where we got to parity -- but then Fleet 3 was the moment where we really surged ahead of the market and became the highest -- the largest selling in video system and public safety. And so actually, I think that's a path you can expect from a lot of our products over time where we reach parity with one version, and then we really accelerate ahead. And so we're really excited about the progress with Fleet 3, Blake Bullock, our product manager and our entire team on Fleet 3 has just done a fantastic job there, and we're really proud of the progress. Still a lot of work to do, but Encouraging to see that product take shape as the highest demand in-car video system and public safety.\nRick Smith: Yes, just a pretty think Fleet 3 is like the perfect example of the power and the beauty of us being both an IoT hardware devices company and a cloud software company under one roof because we can deliver an end-to-end experience that not only functionality-wise, but then economically really feeds off of itself as part of our flywheel. And so not only is Sweet hands down the best straight up hardware and car camera system that's ever been released. But in combination with the revolutionary improvements we made to democratize access to great ALPR, it makes it an extraordinarily attractive software add-on to buy that they can either buy the front or they can easily add at any point later with just the flick of a switch, and the whole thing works end to end the with the rest of our suite. .\nAndrea James: We have two folks left. Elisa Shreve is on for Tim Long at Barclays. Elisa, you're off mute, but we're not hearing anything come through Okay. Let's go to Josh Riley from Needham.\nJosh Riley: It seems like there's more opportunity for you guys to have some competitive takeaways in body cams in the U.S. based on our discussions with customers. Is that what you're seeing today? Or would you characterize more of the growth in 2022 as a greenfield with officers who didn't have a body cam at all?\nJosh Isner: I think, Josh, the nice part is it's a combination of both. We continue to sell high volumes of body cameras to new customers, but we also continue to see existing customers buy more and deploy more widely. And then, of course, by more and more of our features that are on top of the body camera and so -- in peripheral products like fleet and virtual reality and drones and so forth. So it's a nice healthy mix across the board, and we're very excited about that. We want to diversify the number of ways we can achieve these types of results. And I think we're doing that, and we're very excited about that trend.\nJosh Riley: Got it. That's helpful. And then can you just remind us, is there any seasonality around any of your products or just the overall business that we should be aware of as we're modeling revenue for 2023? And how could the TASER ramp impact the first couple of quarters of the year's TASER revenue, if at all?\nJosh Isner: I think, again, like we've got a number of ways to deliver in each quarter. And so it's -- of course, if we start out with strong shipments of TASER 10, then that makes the path easier, but that's not our only path. And so we're excited about the fact that between all of our hardware products and just the growing base of software revenue that we have in the business that we've been thoughtful about our guidance here. We believe it's very achievable. We continue to expect to grow 20% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.  So we'll continue to to execute here and make sure that between TASER shipments and all of our other products that we're very thoughtful about how we guide.\nBrittany Bagley: Yes. And specifically, I would say, Josh, we're not calling out anything unique on the shape of the year. And so I would expect pretty typical seasonality for us. even with T10 coming in, like we still have really nice strong T7 performance. And so we've got a lot of puts and takes to Josh's point, and I would say, for your model, think about normal seasonality.\nAndrea James: Elisa, should we try one more time? Okay. Go ahead. Let's have Rick Smith close us out.\nRick Smith: All right. Well, again, it's always such a pleasure to be able to share results like this. Josh, Brittany, the whole team, some of the other names you heard, a lot of people working really passionately and hard to turn these results in. And I couldn't be more excited to see how this year unfolds. TASER 10, Fleet 3, our software products really starting to scale themselves as you're seeing in the financial results. So a lot of exciting things look forward to. We look forward to seeing some of you accelerate in April at our shareholder meeting, which I believe is coming up in May. And then we'll be back to share Q1 results here in a few weeks as well. So thanks, everybody. We appreciate the opportunity to work for you on such an amazing mission.\nAndrea James: Good bye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Andre and Angel. Great job. And to our investors, I hope you can feel the passion that comes through in that video. And I'm just so humbled to be a part of this team. And the formula is really work for us is when we focus on one of the most important problems we can solve that gets us solving the things that are also the most valuable problems for our customers. And that ultimately is what puts up the results that you see from last year. So TASER 10 is the most sophisticated, accurate and effective TASER energy weapon we've ever created. It's a huge leap forward.  Future generations may simply take for granted the existence of these truly capable less lethal technologies as if they had always existed. And like all technological advancements that drive our society forward, that is our goal. Now the customer reception has been fantastic. We are incredibly humbled to be at the forefront of breakthrough technology and societal change. Our 2022 standout performance with revenue up 38% and strong profitability and cash flow follows multiple years of exceptional results even through difficult macro environments. Axon's history of superior execution can be traced to a few key things: our vision and mission; our long-term strategic thinking, and that attracts just an amazing team of passionate and talented people and our relentless focus on customers, we build upon a solid foundation of customer trust. And finally, our conviction to double down on investments to drive unprecedented change and cumulative growth.  A prime example of this is the foresight we had more than a decade ago to start building a software business. In 2022, our recurring high-margin cloud revenue comprised more than 30% of the company total. It's great to see our long-term strategies continuing to be a -- to that end, I'll take a moment to talk about areas where we're currently investing to ensure that Axon continues to drive value creation well beyond the 2025 planning horizon we're sharing today. The future policing will include more robotic security, full stop.  We stood up our Axon Air program a few years ago, and we continue to invest in that. We view drone and robotics technology, first and foremost, as a way to extend visibility and communications for first responders. Robotic security is already playing an increasingly important role in search and revenue natural disaster response, crime and accident scene reconstruction and a new category of DFR or drone as a first responder. We see potential for robotic security to play a greater role in de-escalation. Numerous high-profile cases. We've all seen these tragedies on the news have inspired police departments to do everything possible to reduce the frequency of use of force incidents. Substituting a robot for a human can help in many types of scenarios. One example is high-risk entry with SWAT teams. We see the opportunity to reduce the need for people as police officers to enter a home with firearms drawn, for example. Another area we see coming is the fusion of intelligent ecosystems that integrate with public safety. How long video for multiple types of cameras and sensors to port into one system, both to assist in real-time response and to support investigations. We're also excited about these recent advances in generative AI and Nearly 6 years ago, we published a vision video with the idea that artificial intelligence could one day extract key information from body camera videos, which, together with a brief oral description from the officer can be used to write the police report for that officer.  Well, that vision no longer feels like science fiction. This vision was part of our thesis and our focus in building out our cloud infrastructure over the past decade, and we are excited to see what capabilities we will be able to leverage over the next few years to delight our customers and to make our public tax dollars much more efficient by automating many mundane yet very time-consuming tasks. And finally, when we build for the future, we collaborate with our trusted constituencies. We work with governments, city councils, public safety and our Ethics and Equity Advisory Council. This council provides invaluable feedback. They ask us the hard questions and help us to see around corners. We look to them for assistance in ensuring ethical design and that we continue to work with our counsel leaders who are each dynamic, highly successful and impressive individuals in their own right. And with that, I'd now like to turn over to our COO, Josh Isner, to talk in more detail about the business. Josh? Well, great question. I would say I have never seen demand this strong in a new TASER launch in my history in the business, which is great news. The subscription model does already have our customers on an upgrade pathway, but I'm working closely with Britney and Josh on a customer-by-customer basis, and we are getting a lot of increase for people that want to upgrade early. And so obviously, the revenue accounting on the -- on our contracts with the multiple deliveries is a bit complex. So we're taking those on a case-by-case basis. But we believe that overall, we will be able to find ways to accommodate customers to be able to take early upgrades in ways that also work for our shareholders and that are profitable for us and help our customers get this capability sooner without the need for any big onetime expenditures by just being able to bring forward and adjust and obviously, we hope they'll also upgrade to some of our other new capabilities that we're launching some of our new VR and other things. So we think this really -- the business model continues to set up a win-win for us and our customers. And one great example is the ability for us to accelerate the upgrade cycles. It's a little bit there. The Fleet is the first major product to launch under the new regime with Hansberitz running our R&D and John Graf and his team running engineering and building in and others and NPI. And basically, what we saw with Fleet, we injected probably six to 12 months of additional prerelease testing to really validate the product. And that paid off in a big way where Fleet 3 is a very sophisticated product, but it's had among the lowest out-of-the-box return rates and customer bugs reported of any product we've ever shipped and TASER 7 -- I'm sorry, TASER 10 went through very similar. It has been in testing with a highly automated production line for probably 6 to 9 months leading into the launch year. So the level of testing compared to previously when we were maybe a less mature company and still making that transition from the more entrepreneurial days. that there's just a lot more time, effort and expense that goes into the upfront testing, but that is paying dividends in the stability and reliability at which we're able to scale these without some of the challenges we had with T7 in particular, come to mind. Sure. No, that's awesome to hear and I couldn't agree more about the power of everything we've done to continue to make the overall suite more attractive, both in aggregate and in the piece parts. And I think just building on what Josh said, that also combines with the power of our OSP flywheel model because as we continue to both add new capabilities into the bundles and ad where appropriate new tiers of the bundle that just makes it, again, easier and easier for agencies to make one simple choice to get access to this very Amazon Prime or Microsoft College basket of both hardware and software benefits that they buy at a price that feels great to them even for the subset of the components that they know they want to use upfront.  And then as they go forward, all those additional benefits of basket feel free because they've already made the what feels to them like a good deal price for the basket and that drives the flywheel. And on top of that, who aren't yet in those programs, all a care are more and more and more seeing the value of those add-ons and incrementally growing ARPU as well as adding new logos. On the record side, again, we continue to be both humble and really excited and optimistic about the continued growth and trajectory. Just sort of using the same numbers we've talked to you about over the last couple of quarters. with growth. Now we have over 50 agencies that represent over almost 18,000 sworn officers live on at least record one module of Axon Records. And that includes now 16 agencies who are already using the product to fully replace their legacy RMS. And that includes, at this point, major cities such as Tucson and Baltimore, Virginia Beach and Fresno. Yes, just a pretty think Fleet 3 is like the perfect example of the power and the beauty of us being both an IoT hardware devices company and a cloud software company under one roof because we can deliver an end-to-end experience that not only functionality-wise, but then economically really feeds off of itself as part of our flywheel. And so not only is Sweet hands down the best straight up hardware and car camera system that's ever been released. But in combination with the revolutionary improvements we made to democratize access to great ALPR, it makes it an extraordinarily attractive software add-on to buy that they can either buy the front or they can easily add at any point later with just the flick of a switch, and the whole thing works end to end the with the rest of our suite. . All right. Well, again, it's always such a pleasure to be able to share results like this. Josh, Brittany, the whole team, some of the other names you heard, a lot of people working really passionately and hard to turn these results in. And I couldn't be more excited to see how this year unfolds. TASER 10, Fleet 3, our software products really starting to scale themselves as you're seeing in the financial results. So a lot of exciting things look forward to. We look forward to seeing some of you accelerate in April at our shareholder meeting, which I believe is coming up in May. And then we'll be back to share Q1 results here in a few weeks as well. So thanks, everybody. We appreciate the opportunity to work for you on such an amazing mission."

            "content": "Thank you, Josh. It's particularly gratifying to see broad-based strength across the business and our strong 2022 execution. Both software and hardware are driving robust performance. Notably, Axon Cloud now represents about one third of our business, carrying best-in-class metrics on growth and net revenue retention. In 2022, cloud revenue grew 50% to $368 million with a 73% gross margin. Annual recurring revenue has grown to $473 million and the net revenue retention is 121%.  In addition, we are incredibly proud of the fantastic job Axon has done selling hardware and subscription bundles. 9% of total revenue in 2022 was tied to a subscription compared to just a few years ago when less than half of revenue was subscription-based. Following on Josh's commentary regarding the GAM opportunity, our updated analysis more closely aligns with our focus as an organization. Axon's core TAM of $45 billion across SaaS categories cameras, professional TASER, Axon Air and VR reflects opportunities and a customer base includes public safety, U.S. federal, international and commercial enterprise. At the same time, the consumer personal protection market remains an opportunity, and I'm currently recruiting for a permanent GM to lead the business. However, as we noted in our shareholder letter, we are refarming our analysis on this market from $18 billion to $5 billion in terms of total TAM.  Almost $5 billion is still large opportunity that we're interested in pursuing, but we are rightsizing our focus to better reflect the normal opportunity we see in our core business. You'll also note that in Q4, we recognized $8.5 million of cloud revenue that we had previously underreported. This revenue relates to work that was completed in prior periods and was unrecognized due to our ERP implementation in 2021. While the impact is immaterial to our financials, it did result in a material weakness. Remediating this will be a focus in 2023, and we have laid out a detailed plan in our 10-K. Against the backdrop of an exceptional 2022 and an improving demand environment, we are thrilled to be sharing another robust outlook for the year ahead. Additionally, now that I've had some time to dig into the business, we are introducing 3-year financial goals. Looking at 2023, my key financial priorities for the year are the following: first, executing against our financial objective of delivering revenue growth of 20%. Second, working towards long-term gross margin improvement. We feel confident in the levers we can pull on gross margin over time, which include investing in automation, improving manufacturing efficiency further growing our software revenue mix and offsetting inflation with pricing. In 2023, we are balancing these opportunities against ramping TASER 10 in the first half of the year, and continuing to catch up on our fleet in-car camera installations.  Our Fleet business carries a lower margin upfront and transitions to high-margin recurring software revenue over time. Third, controlling operating expenses by enhancing our financial discipline. In 2023, we are still digesting large investments we made in 2022 and investing for growth. We are guiding to 20% adjusted EBITDA margin, which implies 50 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Fourth, delivering on our ecosystem vision by leveraging strategic partnerships, investments and potentially M&A. And fifth, setting us up to ensure we are on the path to hitting our 3-year goals.  Turning to those goals. Our 2025 outlook for more than $2 billion in revenue is underpinned by our confidence that we can deliver on the 20% CAGR that we've communicated previously, and as Josh laid out the drivers. Over the next three years, we also expect to drive gross margins and leverage our operating expenses to achieve approximately 25% adjusted EBITDA margins. We are excited to demonstrate the increasing profitability of the business, and this represents significant expansion of more than 500 basis points. We are also focusing on cash flow and through prudent management of working capital and CapEx, we are targeting adjusted free cash flow conversion above 60% on adjusted EBITDA.  This allows us to both invest in our business and deliver attractive free cash flow generation. Finally, we have heard you on share count dilution. And while we will spend the next few years working through existing stock comp expenses, we are committing to bring our dilution down on a go-forward basis. Personally, I'm incredibly energized by the runway we see over the next three years. Axon enjoys a compelling business model, delivering subscriptions to a stable and growing end user market. We enjoy low global TAM penetration, strong customer relationships, and innovative R&D capabilities that are building solutions to meet a critical market need.  With that, I would like to open it up to questions. Yes. So I'm taking the gist of the question to be when might we get to that 25% margin. And we're really looking to make sure we get there by 2025, Sami, like there are a bunch of those puts and takes that we're looking at both for 2023. And certainly, part of getting to the OpEx leverage that we've talked about is getting to that $2 billion in revenue. And so we need to pull those levers, and it's nice that we have multiple different levers to get there, both from a gross margin and an OpEx standpoint. I think it goes to everything from how we design the product to how we design our manufacturing capabilities. We've talked about how when we get to scale, which will happen in the second half of the year. So we are calling it out as a little bit of a potential headwind in the first half of the year. But as we get to the second half of the year, it will be gross margin neutral. And I think the team learned a lot from the T7 launch and took those learnings into T10 and we're thoughtful and careful on the gross margin front. Yes, of course. One, I would say, as you can tell, because it's been a little bit of time. Now it was very much opportunistic from our side to strengthen the balance sheet and to give ourselves a bit more flexibility from a capital standpoint. And we think we found a time to get attractive terms in the market. So we're very pleased that we were able to proactively get ahead of that. And then I think you heard me talk about how we have been investing in our ecosystem partners, how we might potentially consider M&A as we look going forward. And so we want to make sure that when we find something that is appealing from an M&A standpoint that we're able to be on our front foot and move quickly and smartly going forward on that.  We spent a lot of time on that convertible offering talking about what might we look for from an M&A standpoint because that was top of everybody's mind. And so a little color is, I think, if you look at our M&A history historically, that's probably a pretty good indication where we're really looking for either technology or talent that will support our future product road map and/or our moonshot goals and mission. Paul Chung at JPMorgan. Yes. So I think we're really looking at the 3-year guidance that not to say we might not get to 30% at some point. But I think this is really meant to sort of replace that and like, okay, we have a plan in a concrete way to get to 25% by 2025, and then we'll start looking out from beyond there in terms of where we will go.  So I wouldn't say we're calling that, but maybe we're phasing that out and focusing on what is actionable and in front of us and what we really see a path to right now, and that's the 25% in 2025. I think you are correctly interpreting that we've got some puts and takes in 2023. And so we're not putting a stake in the ground specifically on any 2023 gross margin guidance. But we do expect to see both improvement on gross margin and OpEx leverage to get to that 25%. Perhaps over time with a little bit more under our belts, we be able to quantify the pieces a bit more.  But for right now, we're just really looking on driving both of those together to hit that 25%. And again, it's about 50 basis points of leverage in 2023. So you are all correctly picking up on more of that improvement will come in '24 and '25. Yes. No, those are all excellent questions. I might go in reverse order, which is I don't want to say that we'll be at that 80% plus consistently. We're really -- we're looking to be at that 60% plus consistently. And the reason that we're there rather than the 80% plus, even though we did a phenomenal job on free cash flow generation this year is -- if you look at '21, I would say we did a less phenomenal job on free cash flow generation. And so if you look at sort of '21 and '22 together, you actually get back to that roughly 60, 65-ish percent free cash flow generation on average between those two years.  And some of the things that lead to that are investing in working capital and investing in inventory as we continue to grow our hardware business, continuing to invest in CapEx like automation. We have a number of those puts and takes that we've looked at and based on places that we are investing in our cash flow. We really think that, that 60% target on an annual basis is what we're looking for, might mean we do better some years. But I think as you look over a 3-year period, and as we've looked back, that's probably the right expectation level to set. While we are growing at the kind of rates we're growing at.  So if we are growing at 20% plus anymore, would we revisit that free cash flow target? Yes, certainly. But at those types of top line growth rate, we think that's the right balance in terms of what we're flowing through. Yes. No, it's a great question. For us, it really is about either vending technology or teams that fit in well with our mission and/or our business model. And so there are multiple parameters that we are looking to evaluate companies on. And so it's always sort of a multifaceted equation for us as we think through them. That's not to say that we aren't looking at whether or not something is financially attractive to us. but it could be across different metrics. It could significantly increase our TAM.  It could help us get conviction on supporting that 20% growth long, long, long term? Or it could be accretive to our gross margins or EBITDA margins. So there isn't sort of one set of things we're looking at, but we're really looking at ways that we can find companies that tuck into our ecosystem. We're looking to really integrate the technology and present a holistic Axon solution as we look forward. And then I'll just note that, that dilution number is really sort of an organic dilution number. So I think we have a strong balance sheet. I think we can certainly use cash for that. If we were going to use equity, I would consider that separately from what we're doing from just an internal stock comp expense standpoint. Yes. And specifically, I would say, Josh, we're not calling out anything unique on the shape of the year. And so I would expect pretty typical seasonality for us. even with T10 coming in, like we still have really nice strong T7 performance. And so we've got a lot of puts and takes to Josh's point, and I would say, for your model, think about normal seasonality."

            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Rick. Last August, I talked about four major areas of focus for the back half of 2022. And I'm pleased to report that we delivered on all fronts. First, we are driving discipline and prioritization across the business. We say no to many opportunities. And when we do say yes, we win. The results of our efforts include a phenomenal close to the year with revenue up 44% in the back half and more than 50% in Q4 alone. And then a game-changing product launch of TASER 10 just a few weeks later.  The second area I talked about was investing to penetrate our total addressable market. In our shareholder letter today, we introduced a new TAM analysis which outlines a $50 billion opportunity and shows growth in our core markets. That core TAM, which includes our SaaS categories, cameras, professional TASER, Axon Air, VR and a customer base that includes U.S. federal, international and commercial enterprises grew from $34 billion to $45 billion in our updated analysis. Much of the TAM we pursue today is in areas where our investments have helped position us as a leader and as a pioneer. We see ourselves as the best positioned to deliver on the future of policing that Rick discussed a moment ago.  Thirdly, I'm very pleased to see us deliver on our promise to generate strong cash flow. For the full year, we delivered $195 million in adjusted free cash flow. This was an 84% conversion on adjusted EBITDA of $232 million. This allowed us to maintain a net cash position roughly flat to last year, while investing CapEx to drive global scale in deploying $83 million in strategic ecosystem investments to ensure we stay at the forefront of industry innovation. Finally, we are assembling a world-class team from top to bottom, some of whom you see on the call here today.  This team brings financial discipline, a next play mindset and the capability to drive outside outcomes for the next 5 years and beyond. We are building a culture where we expect to deliver on our commitments to employees, to customers and to our investors. Looking forward to 2023, Working with Britney, we have streamlined our company-wide bonus metrics to four core items. The entire organization is incentivized to measure, drive toward and exceed the following: number one, revenue. Top line growth remains a top priority. Number two, adjusted EBITDA margin, which Bindi will take you through in a moment. Number three, new market expansion in the U.S. federal government and international markets and number four, new product adoption, ensuring that the products we are building continue to be adopted and used by our customers.  We never stopped helping our existing customer base to walk up the value chain and take advantage of our new software features. Finally, before bringing lays out our 3-year plan to achieve $2 billion in revenue, I wanted to provide some color on what we think will help us build toward that milestone. Our path to $2 billion in revenue and beyond will be driven by a combination of selling new products into our existing markets and by selling existing products into new markets. We continue to introduce new products that deliver value to our existing customer base of U.S. state and local law enforcement, and we believe we will continue to grow our share of wallet in that market. Items such as TASER 10, Fleet 3, virtual reality, Axon Records, Axon Dispatch, Axon Air and the multitude of Evidence.com add-ons will continue to drive growth amongst our state and local US customers. In parallel, we will continue to grow international, federal and enterprise, leveraging our core product portfolio. Not only will the combination of these two simultaneous motions create top line growth opportunities for the future, well beyond 2025, but they will also provide multiple paths to our annual revenue guidance year in and year out.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Brittany. Yes. Great question, Sam. I'd say any time we're a sales agent, there is a revenue impact when we sell through a partner's product. But to set expectations, I think that will be a relatively small part of our overall revenue for next year. So it's part of it. And then when you look at the rep level commission plans, we do have a new product sales team that is essentially compensated in large part in momentum of both new products and partner sales. So that's how we solve for that. Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. Actually, I think it's very much that we have a lot of confidence in all of our product categories and market categories that continue to grow significantly year-over-year. And as I'm sure you're aware, we talked about in the past that we do measure five-year normalized in as kind of a forward-looking indicator of what revenue will look like into the future and not only on a gross basis, but on a year-over-year basis, and we continue to be optimistic about the results we're seeing and the 5-year bookings growth in that 5-year bookings growth rate.  And so it's a combination of seeing a lot of really exciting indicators in our new markets, seeing our new product scale and seeing some of the reinforcements in terms of future revenues that the look into bookings provide. Yes, absolutely. Without going into too much detail there, I think the 10 forecast is exceeding year one of the TASER 7 actuals from five years ago. So we're encouraged to see that and it speaks to the value and utility of the product. I would say that it's something we're managing very closely in terms of both early upgrades and new customer shipments. And it provides certainly on path to meet our guidance for the year. We're going to exceed our guidance for the year, but there are several paths toward that goal as well. So we don't want to get too far out over our skis here.  We want to make sure that the product we ship is a very high quality one that scales very well in the field. And as we do that, we'll certainly continue to ship all the other high-demand products that we offer to combine for a really nice year this year. Yes, absolutely. I think it's just timing of shipments and orders. And I think toward the end of the year as we looked at the year and the upcoming product launch. We wanted to be thoughtful about with a product launch a couple of years away, just maintaining flexibility for our customers as we knew some might be interested in the next one. And so we tried to manage that as best we could.  And we're very excited to see the supply chain opening up on fleet. I think you'll notice that was a big item in terms of the volume of fleet that shipped in Q4. We expect that to continue throughout the year. We mentioned some of the supply chain challenges historically. We're cautiously optimistic that we're past kind of most of the storm there and feeling good about having the opportunity to ship certainly record-breaking amounts of Fleet 3 this year and of course, plenty of tasers, body cameras and some of our other solutions as well. I don't have the exact number in front of me, but I'd say over the last year, in terms of the amount of CW shipped, TASER 7 was above 80% to 85% of the total there. So I think that speaks to the fact that much of the market had moved over from our legacy smart weapons into TASER 7. And now we have the opportunity to, of course, upgrade all of our early TASER 7 customers. But as Rick mentioned, I think there'll be some that are more recent that will be interested as well. So we're very excited to get as many case tens out there as we can. As on TASER 10 will start shipping in March. . Yes, it was just about component availability, I think. Is that right, Will? Yes, absolutely. So our supply chain team, as always, has just done a fantastic job staying ahead of the curve in what are less challenging times than maybe a year or two ago, but any time you launch a new product, there are a lot of provisions and moving parts leading up to that. And ultimately, we feel really good about our capacity not only this year, but continuing to build out our automation capabilities to more exponentially expand our capacity into the future. And so certainly, we have plenty of inventory to support our revenue guidance and beyond for this year and next year, we're aggressively planning for even higher demand. Maybe I'll start with the dentist question and then hand it over to Jeff for records. But the reason I want to take this one will is to give Jeff a huge shout out for the work he's done over the last few years. He's essentially built a team that not only has delivered on the core ecosystem, but continues to build out the last mile types of features and products that make the product, not only that much more valuable to our core market, but also more attractive to our kind of up-and-coming markets in federal and international. And so his team has just done a great job continuing to identify opportunity and market needs and then executing well on the plan to deliver those capabilities and just that flywheel continues to lend itself to more customer interest and more happy customers that will buy more over time. And so that's been the backbone of our dems adoption. And maybe Jeff, I'll take it over to you on records. AJ, just real quick, I think will deserve a shout out for the best T-shirt on the call today. That's the 10 shops and 45 feet from the TASER 10. So great fashion sense. Yes, absolutely. Thanks a lot for the question. Nice to see you, Jeremy. On TASER 10 ASPs, we're not going to get too prescriptive there, but I'd say you should expect an uplift over previous generations and -- that's part due to the hand price and also part due to the number of cartridges in the bundle relative to previous models. And so I think we published the list prices on the website, so you can kind of derive from that what type of uplift to it will be in our bundles. So there'll be a slight inherent discount associated with any product in a bundle, but at a high level, that's kind of the story with TASER 10. And then with Fleet 3, no outsized orders like just a lot of volume, and you should expect that to continue and and maybe even higher levels this year.  The product has great product market fit. It's a well-built, well-designed product. the ALPR functionality associated with it is in high demand. ALPR is one of our fastest-growing software add-ons across the business. I think historically, you might remember our Fleet One system, which was more or less a body cam attached to a windshield and then fleet two was the moment where we got to parity -- but then Fleet 3 was the moment where we really surged ahead of the market and became the highest -- the largest selling in video system and public safety. And so actually, I think that's a path you can expect from a lot of our products over time where we reach parity with one version, and then we really accelerate ahead. And so we're really excited about the progress with Fleet 3, Blake Bullock, our product manager and our entire team on Fleet 3 has just done a fantastic job there, and we're really proud of the progress. Still a lot of work to do, but Encouraging to see that product take shape as the highest demand in-car video system and public safety. I think, Josh, the nice part is it's a combination of both. We continue to sell high volumes of body cameras to new customers, but we also continue to see existing customers buy more and deploy more widely. And then, of course, by more and more of our features that are on top of the body camera and so -- in peripheral products like fleet and virtual reality and drones and so forth. So it's a nice healthy mix across the board, and we're very excited about that. We want to diversify the number of ways we can achieve these types of results. And I think we're doing that, and we're very excited about that trend. I think, again, like we've got a number of ways to deliver in each quarter. And so it's -- of course, if we start out with strong shipments of TASER 10, then that makes the path easier, but that's not our only path. And so we're excited about the fact that between all of our hardware products and just the growing base of software revenue that we have in the business that we've been thoughtful about our guidance here. We believe it's very achievable. We continue to expect to grow 20% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.  So we'll continue to to execute here and make sure that between TASER shipments and all of our other products that we're very thoughtful about how we guide."

And before we turn the call over to Rick, we will do our investor video. [Audio/Video Presentation]\nRick Smith: Thank you, Andrea and Angel. Our year-to-date results are pretty exciting with revenue growth of 32% in the first 9 months. So what's the secret sauce that's driving this revenue growth Josh and Brenda will provide color on the details, and we also outline them for you in our shareholder letter. But at the highest level, we provide products that solve real-world problems. Our solutions work -- we make our customers happy, we keep them safe and the public benefits. So we benefit and our shareholders benefit. I've been spending a lot of time with customers and communities on our Moonshot goal because helping the public to dream with us deepens our relationships and answers about the broader questions about why we invest in the areas that we do. It also paves the path for us to keep innovating in areas that will make a difference. We have been really heartened by the buy-in we've seen on the Moonshot, bringing together groups that you don't normally see alongside each other. These include the fraternal order of police, the African American Mayors Association, the major county shares of America, the national organization of Black Law Enforcement executives and the National Policing Institute to name just a few. A common reaction I've been getting about our moonshine is well, this all sounds great, but how are you going to do this? Look, we don't have all the specific answers just yet. Just like when Jack Kennedy challenged the nation to put a human on the moon, not all the tech existed yet. But we have a good idea of where Axon can invest to move the needle. Using technology to solve deeply entrenched challenges is why I founded the company and why we're here today. Aon has been and will continue to double down on our investment in things like number one, nonlethal tools, such as our enormously successful TASER platform. We believe the majority of TASER adoption remains in front of us. We're still under 10% penetrated in terms of our global TAM. And we're working on some really exciting technology over the next 10 years to help hit our goal. Number two, virtual reality. We're seeing a lot of interest in our VR training, which we sell on a subscription to customers. Number three, cameras and sensors that never miss a moment. Over the next few years, you're going to see us introduce next-generation body cameras, and we'll keep them a tie between our real-time operations and our devices, which brings me to #4, real-time and remote response. The public safety sector deserves public safety-grade communications tools that are as easy to use as consumer technology. They deserve better situational awareness and it will help them improve their decision-making and their ability to respond effectively. Also, we believe that remote response can limit human exposure to danger. Our thinking is that we're moving the officer from harm's way leads to safer outcomes for everyone. And this is why we're investing in Axon Air. Our drone solutions as a first responder as well as counter drone technology. Number five, we're investing in community impact, engagement and feedback tools. such My90, which is a tuck-in acquisition we completed last year of a company that essentially allows the public and rank and file officers to anonymously deliver feedback to police leadership. This tool is already helping police departments deepen trust with their communities. Number six, we're investing in more comprehensive and actionable response to resistance reporting. This includes both traditional use of course, and de-escalation data. Data collection tools today either don't exist or they don't talk with each other very well or the data is just not collected in a way that's very useful. We believe the public is hungry for better data, especially on incidents involving in support. And we believe we can meet this need. And we need this data to reach our Moonshot. Now we know the Moonshot Gold will not be easy, but we also know that the private sector and companies like Axon have a unique role to play. As I look at our team, which includes leaders like Josh and Britney I'm confident that they'll ensure we continue to invest prudently with a high degree of accountability to all of our stakeholders, driving the business model that creates impressive value creation, solves some of the most challenging problems facing modern society. and delivers great shareholder returns. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Josh.\nJosh Isner: Thanks a lot, Rick. During last quarter's call, I mentioned that the primary thing we can control is where we collectively focus our attention. Our sights remain set on continued top line growth, which I will address and margin expansion over the long term, which Britney will cover. We are increasingly confident that we can do both well in parallel. On the top line, we are very pleased with quarterly revenue of 34% and our Q4 outlook for 40% growth at the midpoint. We're having a strong year, and we are seeing a strengthening of demand across all product lines. Britney will unpack the revenue growth in the quarter for you shortly. But I'd like to take a moment to touch upon what we believe will sustain healthy growth rates of 20-plus percent for the years to come. We're growing along 2 axes. The first is expanding our product suite for existing customers. Both Rick and the shareholder letter talked about a product road map where we believe we can continue to deliver premium solutions to customers at a compelling value proposition for them. We want to make it super clear that our state and local law enforcement business is nowhere near saturated, and we see a long and wide runway for continued growth. We believe that in the next 5 years, you will see Axon emerge as the leading operating system for public safety, strengthened by our strategy of focusing on the customer experience and not cobbling together point solutions that don't work well together, which is the current state of the industry outside of Axon. The second axis is deferred buying into new markets by both adding new types of customer profiles or users and by adding to our core customer base. You can think of our core customers as falling into roughly 4 categories of funding sources, the U.S. state and local governments, the U.S. federal government, international government customers and commercial enterprises. Simultaneously, the types of users we are adding to our platforms is expanding beyond law enforcement. We are adding attorneys, fire and EMS personnel, corrections in the U.S. military and the funding for those types of users generally rolls up into the 4 sources I mentioned. I'd like to update you on 2 of those 4. First, our progress with the U.S. federal government and second, touch upon international growth. We are very excited about our U.S. federal government business. In the first 3 quarters of 2022, the federal government has booked contracts exceeding $200 million, up from an approximate $15 million to $20 million run rate just a few years ago. Annual revenue has grown to the tens of millions and our deliverables now extend over the next several years. Our progress with the federal government is a direct result of our intentional investments in both sales channel and product. We have been building trusted relationship with agencies that are now finding value in our products and missions and our commitment to helping them be successful. And while we can't necessarily name all of those customers, the breadth and depth of the federal government's interest in our entire product line continues to excite us. And now turning toward global expansion. We continue to refine our international go-to-market strategy. We see 2 things as being the drivers and even the accelerators to international growth. The first is continuing to innovate on our TASER platform. We believe the total TASER installed base has room to grow by more than 5x over time. And as we continue to develop technology that potentially matches a pistol in terms of stopping power, we think we have the opportunity to become the primary defense weapon in several international markets. The second thing we are focusing on is helping European customers overcome their historical resistance to cloud solutions. This is a playbook we ran in the U.S. starting in around 2012. And domestic state and local customers at first were very averse to cloud-hosted software, and we successfully evangelized the cloud to build a business that now tops $400 million in annual recurring revenue. We are starting to chip away at cloud acceptance in the EU, and we see European governments starting to adopt other commercial services for cloud, and we believe that this bodes well for our international SaaS business. Just like in the U.S., once we overcome that initial version, strong adoption of evidence management will follow. Finally, last quarter, I told you that I am working on building the team that Axon needs for the next 5 to 10 years. We are thrilled to introduce Brittany Bagley, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Business Officer. She brings a wealth of experience not only as a public company CFO, but also as a seasoned board member and investor in the technology segment. We sought to attract an executive who brings a NexPlay mindset, versatility, mental toughness and a strong capability to deliver outside outcomes and we are excited that Britney brings all of those qualities to Axon. Based on working with Britney over the last 40 days, I can say with confidence and excitement that the future of Axon's core strategic and financial functions is very, very bright. Now I'll hand it over to Brittany.\nBrittany Bagley: Thank you, Josh. Hi, everyone. I'm thrilled to be on my first official Axon earnings call. I want to start with a big thank you to the team for making it such a great quarter and to Jim Zito for doing such a nice job in the interim CFO role. It's an exciting time to have joined such an incredible company. I'd like to share a little about why I joined and where you'll see me put my focus over the coming quarters. While there were many reasons to join, 3 main ones that I would like to highlight include the strong leadership team, the company is inspiring mission to protect life and the compelling business model.  On that last one, especially, I think the combination of the hardware ecosystem the company has been building along with innovative software solutions creates a powerful flywheel that is both high growth and profitable, which provides a relatively rare position in the technology world. Additionally, delivering mission-critical products to public safety customers who purchase on long-term contracts makes Axon's revenue both recurring and dependable. As Josh discussed, we continue to have a lot of growth in front of us, and I look forward to supporting our mission and a profitable growth trajectory.  To that point, my areas of focus will be on helping the team continue to execute and deliver strong results over the next several years. As both CFO and Chief Business Officer, I get to take a strategic and holistic view of the business to ensure we're making the right long-term decisions to deliver on our mission and our financial promise. Near term, that means spending time, better understanding Axon's gross margin potential and how I can help move the needle on other metrics we care about, including overall profitability and cash flow. We see opportunities to improve gross margin by investing in automation, driving manufacturing efficiency and improving fixed cost absorption as we scale. Driving the revenue mix further towards software is also a key gross margin lever over the longer term. We are also focusing on controlling OpEx by enhancing financial discipline while still investing in research and development and sales channel expansion to support future growth. In addition to leaning in on operational areas of the business, I am also focused on helping Axon to deliver upon its strategic ecosystem vision, leveraging partnerships, investments in M&A, to truly become the leading technology hub for public safety. Turning now to the quarter. Our domestic business grew 37% year-over-year in Q3 and continues to make up more than 80% of our revenue. This strength came across the board, supporting strong TASER segment growth at 19% along with great Software and Sensors segment growth at 51%, which was driven by Sensors growth of 51% and Axon Cloud growth, also at 51%. One of the great things we're seeing domestically is strong demand for the premium versions of our products and bundles. Beyond the strength in our core business and the traction we're seeing on our software and cloud revenue, we continue to be excited about other areas of growth, including our international business, which delivered 20% growth in Q3. We had a strong Q3 gross margin of 62%, which represented more than 100 basis points of sequential improvement. The increase was primarily due to the strength of Axon Cloud and the overall product mix in the quarter. Axon Cloud gross margin in Q3 benefited from our new long-term contract with Microsoft Azure. While this benefit will continue, we also have low to no margin professional services costs which supports the setup of these contracts and the mix can change quarter-to-quarter. That doesn't change our view on exceeding the long-term target of 80% plus for the software business, but we do expect quarterly variations as a result. In addition to the sequential gross margin improvement, the strong top line revenue allowed us to achieve good operating leverage in the quarter and resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $68 million or 21.7% margin. Finally, I wanted to touch on our outlook. Given the strong quarter, we are raising our annual revenue guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.16 billion, which reflects about 34% annual growth at the midpoint. This also implies Q4 annual revenue growth of 40% at the midpoint. Turning to our adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our outlook from $200 million to a range of $215 million to $220 million, which we believe demonstrates strong performance on profitability. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $49 million to $54 million. Implied margins are down slightly sequentially from Q3 on product mix and less OpEx leverage but remained strong overall with an almost 19% EBITDA margin implied at the midpoint for the year. We are proud of our performance and outlook, and they speak to the bigger picture that Rick and Josh talked about, which is the overall strength of the business we are building. We look forward to delivering another strong Q4 and setting ourselves up well for 2023 and as we execute against our financial objective of profitably delivering a 20%-plus top line CAGR going forward. With that, I would like to open it up to questions back to Andrea.\nA - Andrea James : Thank you, and we have you all in the queue. So if you're on the call, assume we've got you in the queue. Thank you so much. We'll take our first question from Josh Reilley at Needham.\nJoshua Reilly: All right. Very impressive results during the quarter. I guess maybe starting off, you had a pretty significant revenue beat here, obviously. How much of a tailwind are you seeing now from stimulus government funds from programs like the ARPA beginning to hit budgets? Or is that something that you see more of an impact in 2023, and beat in Q3 is driven more by budgets that haven't been impacted to date by those budgets?\nJosh Isner: Yes. I don't -- Josh, I appreciate the question and nice to see you again. I don't necessarily think there's a ton of correlation between our momentum and results in any onetime or kind of recurring government subsidy for products. I think ultimately, we're building a very strong business where there's a very high ROI on our products and our customers continue to see that and not only buy more of them, but buy more and more premium levels and licenses. And so while those are nice moment in time types of tailwinds for some customers, I don't think they have any major implication on our continued growth, and we're very confident that independent of those factors, we're building a very strong and consistent business.\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. That's super helpful. And then the TASER gross margin was down sequentially and remains probably below where you guys wanted. I know that's a focus now for Britney as you're evaluating cost there. But was there anything specific in the quarter that brought the margin down sequentially? Or any color there would be helpful. .\nBrittany Bagley : Yes. I would say that we have been investing in everything related to our manufacturing capacity as well as supply chain for the TASER. And so you have seen that impact the gross margin this quarter and a little bit year-to-date. I think it will be 1 of the big areas of focus as we look to improve gross margins is making sure we can really scale into those costs and scale as we get leverage on ross margin over time.\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. Congrats again.\nAndrea James : Next question from Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho : Let me echo my congratulations as well. I wanted to start out with your commentary around sort of the higher-end bundles and maybe customer behaviors that are leading to more selection of that higher-end bundle I just want to understand sort of why you're seeing this behavior and whether you expect it to purchase or not?\nJosh Isner: Yes. Certainly, Jonathan. I think the first thing I'd say on those bundles is even though we're seeing a lot of demand, there's a white space ahead of us in terms of adoption of those bundles, especially in state and local, and it's really driven by the adoption is driven by the idea that in those bundles, we're adding more and more value-added add-ons.  And so Jeff's team is doing a fantastic job understanding accidental contact -- sorry about that. The I think Jeff's team is doing a great job understanding some of what the customers are wanting in future releases of our products and then going back and building those things that are highly valuable. An example of that is transcription. And another example is VR, both of which exist in our more premium version of the Officer Safety Plan, and that's driving a lot of customers toward those bundles. And so we'll continue to iterate on that strategy and make sure that the things that are the most highly valued in tandem with our core products appear and bundles in a way that make the customer excited about the potential of buying all of these items and features at 1 time and 1 license.\nRick Smith: Josh, I would add to it as well. What I'm seeing with customers, I haven't -- I can't think of a customer that's been like gone up to a premium bundle and gone down the other direction, that the more stuff they use from us, the more value they see in it and very sort of the flywheel effect where what I'm hearing from customers is they just want to put more of their solutions with Axon. -- they struggle with technology. They're hamstrung by really long, complex procurement rules that make it very difficult for them to be agile in what they're doing. And so I think we've earned their trust and it's really incumbent on us to keep earning it every day. So we don't break this dynamic, but it does seem to me that they're pretty consistently moving up the ladder each time we launch something that integrates with the other stuff. It's paying off, it's working well. And again, a lot of that just goes to awesome execution and Jeff the product team.\nJonathan Ho : Excellent, excellent. And just as a follow-up, with the U.S. Fed opportunity -- U.S. federal government opportunity, what has been most impactful in terms of helping you break into this market? I mean, obviously, it's been a target for a number of years, but it seems like things improved from a step function perspective. what initiatives or what level of education do you have to sort of provide to kind of get further into the U.S. debt opportunity .\nRick Smith: So I'll start and then maybe hand back over to Josh. I think investing to get that ramp accreditation for the Eves.com system early. It was a bit of a bet when we did it, right? It was expensive. It was difficult to invest in that. And I think to this day, we're still the only Fed ramp accredited or certified system and all these federal agencies that want to use the cloud, that obviously gives us a tremendous advantage. And then we've obviously seen things like the administration moving towards standardization with body cameras. And then Richard Collin, who we hired a few years ago, is really, I think, just done a great job building out a team that really understands the federal space and is building some fantastic relationships.\nJosh Isner: Yes. I'd just add to that, Rick, especially on the last point. For us, every problem starts with how do we build a strong team, full of subject matter experts that we can trust there instincts and expertise to execute. And when we brought Richard in, that was 2 years into our business, and we haven't quite cracked the code on how to run a growing federal business and just bringing him on along with a very talented team with him as well as more and more product focus has just unlocked this amazing opportunity and even though we've had a phenomenal year and seen a literal 10x in bookings at this point in the last few years, we still think we're very much on our own side of the field and have a long way to go to maximize the full opportunity across federal, but we really believe we have the team in place to do that. \nAndrea James : Next question, Erik Lapinski. Go ahead, Erik. And from Morgan Stanley.\nErik Lapinski : I maybe want to just follow up a little bit on the federal side because it looks like at least the deal with the Veteran Affairs was pretty comprehensive across the product portfolio, whereas I know you're in other federal agencies, maybe with some products but not all of them. I guess just would be curious on that, like as you're moving into newer federal agencies, do you see the opportunity for more of a sizable kind of across the spectrum deal upfront? I maybe haven't seen 1 that included fleet previously. So it would be good to just kind of understand the vision there that some federal customers are having and kind of if you are seeing more of that.\nRick Smith: Let me start first, and then I know Josh is going to want to talk to this, too. I would say this is where we see the advantage. We talk about being a mission-focused business. And a lot of times, that can sound like puffery or kind of fluff, but it really is true. We are running this business to solve problems we're passionate about. And of course, we also want to run a rigorous business where we have financial models that make sense. But the finance has come from the problems we solve and infusing that in every employee, I'm just so impressed with the team and the attitude they've got where it's all about keeping our customers productive and safe and happy, and we really give a lot of latitude to our teams to make things right. And where that pays off is we don't think of these as just contracts we're going to sell and make a few bucks to move on to the next one.  And so we get phenomenal customer references and the investments we make in really delivering a great product to the end user, not focusing on winning the bid RFP sort of bureaucratic process I think, builds the type of things where you see these relationships where people even relatively early on, they're cross checking with their other agency customers that are similar, and they're getting the confidence to give us a large part of their technology ecosystem. So I think that's the underlying thing is the focus of the team on really the passion around the business to build things that really delight and protect our customers that give customers the confidence to go do that. But I'll turn it over to Josh to maybe give a little more color to federal specifically.\nJosh Isner: I think Jeff was going to chime in first, Rick. .\nJeff Kunins: Yes, sure. I totally echo everything Rick said. And then combined with that, you've heard us talk a lot, whether it's in margins or in many other places about scale and our flywheel and leverage over time. But in the way we invent and deliver our products to our customers as we do these market segments, expansion. The same thing is true there as well because you can think of leverage where we've spent a decade on our core dams and cameras products and then even longer on TASER. And at this point, even internally, what we have is small surgical dedicated parts of our engineering team for these expansion markets like federal who can inherit all of the common aspects of those products that are already fit for purpose for all segments we're competing in, but then overlay on top of that in a very focused way what our federal customers need to tailor those existing products to unlock federal. And then over time, as that keeps getting even more and more large and well situated, you'll see us build bespoke products that might be first for federal after we've earned the right by building out those sockets with loyalty to the products that we already had.\nJosh Isner: And I'd just add, finally, I think, to your question about fleet specifically, Eric, in federal, I think is we'll have 1 or 2 products off the bat that are nice fits for the customer and expand for lack of a better term from there. And then there will be other customers that see the value across the board in terms of what we offer and want to engage in a more extensive contract upfront. I think we still maintain the belief that either way, longer term, the customer ends up in the same place, which is very happy with Axon's full suite of products. And the VA is a great example of an agency that trust us on day 1 to deliver all of it. And in some other cases, we'll see that same phenomenon over time.\nErik Lapinski : Awesome. That's really helpful. And maybe if I could just sneak in a follow-up. But more focused on records. It looks like in the release, you included at this point, you kind of have 40 agencies and 12 doing a full replacement. Just as we think about, obviously, a full replacement a very intensive workload. How much are you being relied on for that type of work? And do you see opportunity to potentially streamline that or build software around it over time that makes it kind of more simplified, I guess, in moving fully to records and just to understand maybe some of the time lines you're seeing with those 12.\nJeff Kunins: Sure, I'll take that. So like we said, we're -- I think like you see when you talk to anyone in the industry, where we remain -- these are big complex deployments just like ERP systems and things like that, and there's nothing that will ever change the fundamental physics that those are big, complex systems because they have big complex work to do, but we are -- we remain extraordinarily optimistic and confident in our long-term trajectory and growing our leadership position in this segment. But we're approaching it and we think a humble and disciplined way, one deployment at a time.  And as you heard us share we are both continuing to go up and to the right steadily in agencies adopting records overall and for their full deployment and the -- our ability to continue to scale up a number of those that we're working on simultaneously and the amount of bespoke work per each successive deployment, both of those are going in the right direction. And so I think you'll see continued steady and accelerating momentum there, but we also are not going to get over our skis and B2 Chess before we've earned it.\nErik Lapinski : Awesome. Congrats on the good quarter.\nAndrea James : Keith Housum at Northcoast.\nKeith Housum : Sure mute my stuff here. Guys, again, everybody else is saying during the phenomenal quarter. But as we look at some of the individual results, Axon Fleet sales were down 15% from the prior year Acanos down as well. Could the core even better? I'm assuming if you had access to some of the I guess, materials you wanted there. I guess perhaps provide a little bit of color on some of those 2 sites that did not perhaps do as well as some of the other items in your portfolio?\nJosh Isner: Yes. Certainly, Keith. And I don't necessarily want to speculate on what the quarter could have been. We're really proud of where we landed. But I think it is an indicator that the future looks bright for a variety of reasons, including increased fleet shipments. We did run into 1 or 2 minor items with the hubs that power our fleet unit from our supplier, but the good news is in Q4, you'll see that demand rebound substantially, and we expect to see our best ever shipment of fleet -- quarter of shipments for fleet specifically in Q4 and the strong demand continues well into the future there. And we're very excited to continue to build on our market lead in that product line.\nKeith Housum : Great. And just as my follow-up and maybe, Brittany, I put you on the hot seat here for your first time. As we talk about the Moonshot goal, how does that fit into Axon's I guess, existing R&D budget and the financial profile? \nBrittany Bagley : Yes. I mean I think the way we philosophically think about it is that we can achieve both really healthy top line growth and head towards that Moonshot. And do that profitably and have a really nice bottom line as part of the business. And so to your point, that will be a balance for us as we go forward. But of course, with our growth, we're not going to stop innovating. We're not going to stop investing in R&D. We're not going to stop coming up with great new products. And so it's just that a lot of those will be focused on helping achieve that mission, but all inside the financial profile that we think is the right long-term profile for the company.\nKeith Housum : So I guess I hear it in our way, you don't have to see a significant expense increase for R&D as a result of this large goal?\nBrittany Bagley : No. There's nothing specifically we're calling out on that. I do think we will continue to invest in R&D, and we've been consistent on saying that, but this wouldn't necessarily change that profile in a way we're calling out today.\nAndrea James : Sami Badri at Credit Suisse.\nSami Badri: All right. My first question was on the 20% annualized growth target I was hoping you could kind of give us an idea on how you're going to get there, either by new subscriptions, existing subscriptions that are seeing some price increases as a function of new features -- maybe you could kind of give us an idea on the composition of that 20% growth. And then my second question is on CapEx. It looks like your guidance was reduced for the year. Could we just go through the puts and takes on that, please?\nJosh Isner: Sure. I'll start with the revenue growth question and then hand it over to Brittany for the CapEx question. I think, Sami, there's -- one of the beauties of our business and business model is there's a lot of different ways we can achieve exciting growth -- and it's not 1 specific thing. I think there are -- some of the things you mentioned are very much in play. We'll continue to invest in new products that delight customers and cause customers to want to buy more at higher pricing tiers and more premium bundles. But I think it really bought boils down to 2 specific things.  One is -- we're going to do a really good job of building new products for our existing customer base, meaning state and local U.S., especially, how do we introduce new products into that base over time. And the second one is applying existing products to newer markets like international, federal and enterprise. And we really believe -- we're doing those things well in parallel, and we'll do them even better in parallel next year. And of course, by doing so, that opens up kind of growth opportunity on both of those axes. So I'll probably leave it at that for now and hand it over to Brittany for the CapEx question. .\nBrittany Bagley : Thanks, Josh. I mean, I think the only thing I would add is I think it's exciting how many levers I see the business having in terms of where and how it can grow. There's an enormous amount of opportunity. So now you have to focus and make sure you're executing against them and going after the right ones, but the opportunity is there. I think from a CapEx standpoint, what we just highlighted is we are making some CapEx investments this year, and some of those are getting really pushed out to next year. It's more of a in a timing piece than a fundamental change in strategy.\nSami Badri: Got it. I have one more question, and it's mainly on working capital and just inventory. Do you foresee inventory levels just consistently stepping up from now all the way perhaps maybe until the end of 2023, just a function of supply chains and components and all those other factors that are essentially increasing inventory levels? \nBrittany Bagley : I'd say there are 2 things right now that are driving our inventory investments. One is, we are still not out of supply chain challenges. So we still have products that are supply constrained that we would like to get back in stock on and get to a better inventory position. And then I think, too, just with the types of growth we're seeing across some of our products, we need to continue to invest in inventory to support that top line growth.  So I do think you'll continue to see that be just a strategic area of investment. I think at the same time, one of the things I talked about is really making sure we are doing a good job with our free cash flow. And so as we get to '23, we'll have to work to make sure we're appropriately balancing strong free cash flow generation with making sure we have that inventory we need to support the top line.\nAndrea James : Paul Chung with JPMorgan.\nPaul Chung: Yes. Okay. So just another follow-up on the free cash flow. So you're putting up record numbers here and have kind of seen free cash flow conversion surge as well. So talk about how the firm has driven the higher conversion? Is this kind of sustainable here.\nBrittany Bagley : I think it's been a big area of focus. The team has done a nice job specifically stepping up what they've been doing from a collection standpoint and paying more attention to our accounts receivable. And so that's a lot of what gets us. I think as we go through the rest of the year to our free cash flow targets. And again, I think it's just -- of course, we need to balance with our inventory investments and making sure we're in the right place from that standpoint, making sure from a CapEx standpoint, we're investing in the business where we need to invest in the business. But there should be some good free cash flow characteristics that we can continue to focus on.\nPaul Chung: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up. On the investments you're pursuing, we saw a lot of that at the show. So we're seeing some momentum across your investment and what can really become more material over time, what do you get excited about on the investments there? \nBrittany Bagley : Yes. Well, I'll start and then maybe I'll let Jeff jump in a little bit, but I get excited in a couple of places. One, there really is this incredible ecosystem that the company has created where the hardware and the software have a flywheel to benefit each other. You heard us talking about how more customers are buying the premium parts of our business. And so that's really proving out the software. And so I get excited that we can make investments in partnerships that continue to drive that ecosystem. At the same time, with my CFO hat, we're going to be thoughtful and we're going to be disciplined about where and how we invest but I really do think we have a unique opportunity in front of us with that as a lever to continue to pull things in. And I think what's great is the more you can bundle some of these products together, the more powerful each one is. And so it's just a great opportunity there. But Jeff, I know you spend a lot of time thinking through the ecosystem and products and where we should make investments. So if you want to add anything.\nJeff Kunins: Sure, absolutely. Thanks, Brittany. Again, thanks for the question. Yes, I think of it, of course, very similarly, I think in 3 core areas. One, as Josh said earlier and Rick alluded to in people not stepping down, the power of our bundles, I sort of belay my own Amazon roots and the power of things like crime or other similarly situated models. The fact is that giving customers for a fair price that they already think is a great deal even for a subset of the benefits that they already know they want to use. And then once they've done that, they have access to at what feels like free to them an additional and steadily growing set of product benefits that just light up.  In fact, just today, I was talking with one of my team members who was at 1 of our major city customers who's already in a particular level of our bundles, but they weren't using performance, for example, and they had been approached by another company with a stand-alone product at IACP, and then we help them realize and remember that they had access to performance and boom, they instantly started using it, and now they're more excited about the bundle than ever. I think the second across our ecosystem, as you've heard Andrew and all of us talk about is not just our own first-party product, but more and more and more the story or the narrative or the idea of the Axon network is becoming more and more tangibly real as customers have and use both our own products and our partners' products, whether that's Block or F\u016bsus or DroneSense or [D-Drone], yes, it's great that they can sometimes buy those on one piece of paper, but the actual products themselves light up in ways that weren't -- were just a moments in a video, a demo vision idea not too long ago, and now they're real.  And then the third that gets me excited about in our own products is more and more of these magical connections and leverage from our software services adding value to our hardware, even once that hardware has already been deployed. And the 2 greatest examples of that are Respond. And so the many, many, many hundreds of thousands of our AB3 body cameras that are now have respond paid licenses connected with them and those agencies using those real-time connected features respond, which is both a paid add-on and great value and ALPR-as-a-software connection to Fleet 3.  And the absolute peanut butter and chocolate combination that our customers are finding of having both the world's best hands-down stand-alone in-car camera system, but that being connected to the world's best cloud-powered democratized access price point and ethically design ALPR system. So it's those connections, both inside our first-party products and across us and our partners' products. That's super exciting for me.\nAndrea James : Will Power at Baird. Go head, Will, you are up.\nWill Power: I guess a couple of questions. First 1 is probably for Josh, maybe Jeff, but nice acceleration in the software revenue in the quarter. I guess I'd love to get any other color around the key drivers of that. How much of that is tied to OSP 7+ adoption, attorneys and dams. I mean what's kind of leading to that acceleration when you've seen the last few quarters?\nJosh Isner: Yes, certainly, Will, nice to see you again. I think it's really just a combination of a few things driving more users to our more premium licenses, expanding our user base to more software-only use cases outside of kind of core state and local, you mentioned attorneys, that's certainly a big one, and there are others along that same realm -- and then just increased overall adoption across Evidence.com even within state and local, we continue to add users every quarter, and we see some of that also in federal and international and enterprise as well. So goes back to really focusing on selling more into our existing markets and then opening up new markets in parallel, and that's 1 of the places we're seeing some of the results. And of course, there's a lot more work to do there as well.\nWill Power : Okay. And then maybe just second question, for Britney. Just as we look at margins, EBITDA margins going forward, I know you touched on it, it sounds like you expect EBITDA margins to dip in I guess it would be great to get any additional color there's going to be higher revenue than I think at least we were modeling previously, obviously, down from Q3, are there seasonal issues there? Q3 obviously helped most helped by the outperformance on the revenue side. But then, I guess, in tandem with that, just your broader thought process on EBITDA margin expansion over the next few years as you move into '23, what does that kind of comp look like relative to '22? Any other kind of frameworks that can help us with there. \nBrittany Bagley : Yes. So I think a couple of things going on in Q4 are we talked about having slightly less leverage on our OpEx -- we do continue to invest in OpEx as we head into the fourth quarter of the year. We have also talked a little bit about how it's still a very positive margin for the overall year. So we'll get to almost 19% EBITDA margins. But I think if you look at sort of last year to this year, what you really saw was gross margins came down year-over-year, and that's a lot of what was impacting our EBITDA margins year-over-year. So we actually have managed to get some OpEx leverage if you look at some of those numbers.  And so as we look and start thinking about what is that going to be like in the future, it's 1 of the main reasons that I'm really starting by digging into gross margins and where can we get some continued leverage in gross margins. That all can then flow through to the bottom line and support what we come out with in terms of longer-term EBITDA targets. We'll have more for you on '23 when we get to our Q4 earnings call, but really looking forward to digging in there and being able to provide some more of that color.\nAndrea James : Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum.\nJeremy Hamblin: Congrats. Brittany, I want to follow up on that last point, actually. So gross performance was pretty solid especially with a lot of the revenue upside tied to 83 cameras. And now that you've had obviously still getting familiar with the company and the opportunities and so forth. But I sense that there is a notable tone change in terms of opportunity on gross margin and that, that may be like a key focus on a go-forward basis of where there's opportunity. So I wanted to get a sense for the timing of -- well, A, how much low-hanging fruit do you think there is because maybe if you're going to gain 500 basis points, how much of that is easy and how much of it is -- you're going to have work hard? So I wanted to get a sense of how much opportunity you think there is overall? And then also the timing on what you think if -- again, I'm just throwing something out there but how much of the gains do you think could happen in the next 18 to 24 versus a five or six year slot? \nBrittany Bagley : Yes. No, I appreciate the question. I mean I would say I think that the business has been well run. And so I wouldn't say there's any glaring low-hanging fruit, but I would also say it's a business that's come through many of the supply -- well, still in many of the ongoing supply chain challenges. So -- the company has been paying PPV and having to invest in manufacturing capacity and automation and all things, I think, that have been talked about but should start to see some benefits going forward as we continue to grow, as we continue to get scale on some of those investments, hopefully as we get to a more normalized supply chain, you saw the growth in software, which is higher margin for us. So that product mix is very important going forward. I think all of those things are the things that we're going to need to do to drive gross margin improvement. \nJeremy Hamblin: Okay. And in a similar vein, then in terms of -- it also sends that maybe your OpEx growth might also be -- there's been a lot of investment over the last few years. And a lot of that was new product rollout and not that you're not still iterating from there. But it does -- I do get the sense that now you're going to mature or realize some of the opportunities in those business that it's taken 4, 5 years to lay the foundation and start to see a little scale. Is that a correct read that obviously, continue to invest, but maybe the rate of growth in your OpEx might be a little bit lower than what it's been in the last few years. \nBrittany Bagley : I mean I think that we're certainly looking to get some good OpEx leverage as we continue to grow. But I also -- I don't want to leave you with the impression that we're not going to continue to invest in their growth because the opportunity in front of us is just so enormous you should all want us to be investing behind going after that. And so I think we're going to continue to be really thoughtful about where we do that and make sure we're getting a good return on those investment dollars, but both from an R&D standpoint and then some of these new channel opportunities are big and you're starting to see that pay off in federal. And so we would like to keep doing that and keep driving that top line growth, just doing that profitably and making sure there's a good balance there and a good focus on really getting return for the dollars we're investing. \nAndrea James : We\u2019ll go a couple of minutes over. Erik Suppiger at JMP. Go ahead.\nErik Suppiger: On the international front, can you talk a little bit about kind of the near-term strategy? I'm not sure if there's a time line associated with the 5x opportunity that you envision there, but can you talk a little bit about kind of your lead products and how you're going to develop the international markets?\nJosh Isner: Sure. I think generally speaking, the focus, Eric, is really to land with 1 product, whether it's on the CEW side, the video side, interview room, in-car video, any of our digital evidence management products, and there we'll bet on ourselves to continue to grow the adoption and numbers and volume of that 1 product, but we'll also grow the adoption and volume of other products along the way.  So right now, we still remain focused on doing everything we can to grow in the U.K. and Canada and Australia being our Tier 1 international markets, but also just finding 1 product to fit in all of these other large national police forces and from their supplement with our additional products. And I think it's working well. We've seen a lot of interesting TASER adoption this year in markets where we haven't really participated before, but we also see a tremendous pipeline going into next year and the year after, not only across TASER, but across body cams and cloud. So we're very excited about the prospects of international, and it's really about that land and expand strategy that we talked about earlier in the call.\nRick Smith: Let me jump in and help the I think, in particular, this Moonshot, right? One can look at that and say, okay, well, how do I tie that back to the commute return to the company? And what we're trying to do is push ourselves not to just think of, in particular, the TASER as a product that we're going to incrementally -- making marginally better than the last version, but how do we absolute the bullet? How do we become the primary defensive weapon and 1 that doesn't fail? When we do that, we will move the TASER from a specialist item that a few officers or a specialized team may have to where every officer is going to need one.  Now in the United States, Police will carry a TASER on 1 hip and a gun on the other. In most international markets, we don't see that dynamic happen where vest-in, I think maybe a more American approach to carry both devices. When we start to approach the stopping power and reliability of a pistol with a nominative weapon, I think that will be a game changer where -- not in the United States, the United States has unique challenges because of the gun culture broadly in the country, cop certainly need to carry both for quite some time. But if you think about France, Germany, Spain or [indiscernible] international where officers are routinely wearing handguns, if we can give them something that's similar in performance stopping power, I think we'll see those countries potentially shift to where a TASER energy weapon can become their primary device and suddenly we go from 5% to 10% of a police force to approximating even a 100%. So I think that sort of thinking is going to pay off in really break out moments of growth for us, particularly in the international space.  And then the other piece is the Cloud. We are hammering the way. It's taken longer than I thought it would in Europe, in particular, to get acceptance to the cloud over the same objections we saw in the U.S. a decade ago. We're seeing some bright spots and signs of light. And I think if we get 1 or 2 leading customers to crack and prove the cloud is safe, but we'll start to see the dam break there as well. So I'm particularly excited about the international opportunities led by TASER overall.\nErik Suppiger: Does the TASER take time? You had talked about the Moonshot and getting to the point where it starts to obsolete bullet. Does that imply that the lead product would be the sensors and dams until TASER starts reaching that level or what -- how do you think between those 2?\nRick Smith: Well, I'd say in many markets, the TASER is already a lead product. It tends to bring us, I think, into more markets because of its unique value proposition. But I think that will accelerate as we continue to step up its capability to move from a specialist capture tool to a highly reliable personal defense system. I don't know if you want to make any additional commentary, Josh.\nJosh Isner: I think that covers it, Rick.\nAndrea James : We'll take questions from one more list and then Rick will close this out. Logan Hennen from  Northland Securities.\nLogan Hennen : Congrats again another great quarter. So with our first question, we were hoping that you guys could shed a little light around what percentage of sales is currently coming from the federal government -- and how do you guys expect that to change come fiscal year '23 and '24?.\nJosh Isner: Yes. Logan, I appreciate the question, and thanks a lot. I don't know that we're going to go into that level of detail right now. I'd say our focus in federal continues to remain on growing bookings and total contract value, with the expectation is that flows to the top line and revenue not only upfront as those contracts are signed, but over time. But at this point, we're not prepared to break out federal revenue. And maybe we'll reassess later. But at the moment, we're stick with the way we're reporting it. \nLogan Hennen : Yes. Understandable. So our next question is, what should we anticipate for fourth quarter bookings? What have you guys kind of noticed so far? Do you expect that to be the highest in any quarter this year?\nJosh Isner: We do expect Q4 to be our highest bookings quarter of the year for sure and maybe even ever depending on a few factors there. So we're certainly excited about it, but that's the extent to which we'll elaborate on that right now. \nAndrea James : All right. Thank you, Logan, and thank you, everyone. We're going to have Rick close us out. \nRick Smith: Thanks, Andrea. And of course, thanks for our shareholders. It is with great pride that we're able to deliver results like this and it is an amazing team. I got to tell you, Josh Isner, having watched him grow in his career is just an amazing team builder and he gets a lot of credit for helping us find and recruit Brittany, who -- This is her first call with you guys, but I can tell you, we're already feeling the magic that she's adding to the team. And of course, Jeff and the amazing team he has built over in product, and he's continuing to just bring in amazing talent.  So there's never been a better time to be at Axon or the Moonshot. We didn't blindly make that promise without some pretty clear vision of how we're going to get there. So to get to the move, we're working on the Saturn V and the Eagle Lander and a lot of really awesome tech, you can expect to see over the next couple of years.  So with that, I'm going to wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you for your patience and sticking with us. Many of -- been following the company for a long time. We're delighted to see the investments we're making in the past pay off, and we're excited to show you where today's investments will pay off tomorrow in the future. So if I don't see you all, enjoy your holidays, and we look forward to talking to you in the new year.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Kunins",
            "content": "Yes, sure. I totally echo everything Rick said. And then combined with that, you've heard us talk a lot, whether it's in margins or in many other places about scale and our flywheel and leverage over time. But in the way we invent and deliver our products to our customers as we do these market segments, expansion. The same thing is true there as well because you can think of leverage where we've spent a decade on our core dams and cameras products and then even longer on TASER. And at this point, even internally, what we have is small surgical dedicated parts of our engineering team for these expansion markets like federal who can inherit all of the common aspects of those products that are already fit for purpose for all segments we're competing in, but then overlay on top of that in a very focused way what our federal customers need to tailor those existing products to unlock federal. And then over time, as that keeps getting even more and more large and well situated, you'll see us build bespoke products that might be first for federal after we've earned the right by building out those sockets with loyalty to the products that we already had. Sure, I'll take that. So like we said, we're -- I think like you see when you talk to anyone in the industry, where we remain -- these are big complex deployments just like ERP systems and things like that, and there's nothing that will ever change the fundamental physics that those are big, complex systems because they have big complex work to do, but we are -- we remain extraordinarily optimistic and confident in our long-term trajectory and growing our leadership position in this segment. But we're approaching it and we think a humble and disciplined way, one deployment at a time.  And as you heard us share we are both continuing to go up and to the right steadily in agencies adopting records overall and for their full deployment and the -- our ability to continue to scale up a number of those that we're working on simultaneously and the amount of bespoke work per each successive deployment, both of those are going in the right direction. And so I think you'll see continued steady and accelerating momentum there, but we also are not going to get over our skis and B2 Chess before we've earned it. Sure, absolutely. Thanks, Brittany. Again, thanks for the question. Yes, I think of it, of course, very similarly, I think in 3 core areas. One, as Josh said earlier and Rick alluded to in people not stepping down, the power of our bundles, I sort of belay my own Amazon roots and the power of things like crime or other similarly situated models. The fact is that giving customers for a fair price that they already think is a great deal even for a subset of the benefits that they already know they want to use. And then once they've done that, they have access to at what feels like free to them an additional and steadily growing set of product benefits that just light up.  In fact, just today, I was talking with one of my team members who was at 1 of our major city customers who's already in a particular level of our bundles, but they weren't using performance, for example, and they had been approached by another company with a stand-alone product at IACP, and then we help them realize and remember that they had access to performance and boom, they instantly started using it, and now they're more excited about the bundle than ever. I think the second across our ecosystem, as you've heard Andrew and all of us talk about is not just our own first-party product, but more and more and more the story or the narrative or the idea of the Axon network is becoming more and more tangibly real as customers have and use both our own products and our partners' products, whether that's Block or Fu\u0304sus or DroneSense or [D-Drone], yes, it's great that they can sometimes buy those on one piece of paper, but the actual products themselves light up in ways that weren't -- were just a moments in a video, a demo vision idea not too long ago, and now they're real.  And then the third that gets me excited about in our own products is more and more of these magical connections and leverage from our software services adding value to our hardware, even once that hardware has already been deployed. And the 2 greatest examples of that are Respond. And so the many, many, many hundreds of thousands of our AB3 body cameras that are now have respond paid licenses connected with them and those agencies using those real-time connected features respond, which is both a paid add-on and great value and ALPR-as-a-software connection to Fleet 3.  And the absolute peanut butter and chocolate combination that our customers are finding of having both the world's best hands-down stand-alone in-car camera system, but that being connected to the world's best cloud-powered democratized access price point and ethically design ALPR system. So it's those connections, both inside our first-party products and across us and our partners' products. That's super exciting for me."

            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrea and Angel. Our year-to-date results are pretty exciting with revenue growth of 32% in the first 9 months. So what's the secret sauce that's driving this revenue growth Josh and Brenda will provide color on the details, and we also outline them for you in our shareholder letter. But at the highest level, we provide products that solve real-world problems. Our solutions work -- we make our customers happy, we keep them safe and the public benefits. So we benefit and our shareholders benefit. I've been spending a lot of time with customers and communities on our Moonshot goal because helping the public to dream with us deepens our relationships and answers about the broader questions about why we invest in the areas that we do. It also paves the path for us to keep innovating in areas that will make a difference. We have been really heartened by the buy-in we've seen on the Moonshot, bringing together groups that you don't normally see alongside each other. These include the fraternal order of police, the African American Mayors Association, the major county shares of America, the national organization of Black Law Enforcement executives and the National Policing Institute to name just a few. A common reaction I've been getting about our moonshine is well, this all sounds great, but how are you going to do this? Look, we don't have all the specific answers just yet. Just like when Jack Kennedy challenged the nation to put a human on the moon, not all the tech existed yet. But we have a good idea of where Axon can invest to move the needle. Using technology to solve deeply entrenched challenges is why I founded the company and why we're here today. Aon has been and will continue to double down on our investment in things like number one, nonlethal tools, such as our enormously successful TASER platform. We believe the majority of TASER adoption remains in front of us. We're still under 10% penetrated in terms of our global TAM. And we're working on some really exciting technology over the next 10 years to help hit our goal. Number two, virtual reality. We're seeing a lot of interest in our VR training, which we sell on a subscription to customers. Number three, cameras and sensors that never miss a moment. Over the next few years, you're going to see us introduce next-generation body cameras, and we'll keep them a tie between our real-time operations and our devices, which brings me to #4, real-time and remote response. The public safety sector deserves public safety-grade communications tools that are as easy to use as consumer technology. They deserve better situational awareness and it will help them improve their decision-making and their ability to respond effectively. Also, we believe that remote response can limit human exposure to danger. Our thinking is that we're moving the officer from harm's way leads to safer outcomes for everyone. And this is why we're investing in Axon Air. Our drone solutions as a first responder as well as counter drone technology. Number five, we're investing in community impact, engagement and feedback tools. such My90, which is a tuck-in acquisition we completed last year of a company that essentially allows the public and rank and file officers to anonymously deliver feedback to police leadership. This tool is already helping police departments deepen trust with their communities. Number six, we're investing in more comprehensive and actionable response to resistance reporting. This includes both traditional use of course, and de-escalation data. Data collection tools today either don't exist or they don't talk with each other very well or the data is just not collected in a way that's very useful. We believe the public is hungry for better data, especially on incidents involving in support. And we believe we can meet this need. And we need this data to reach our Moonshot. Now we know the Moonshot Gold will not be easy, but we also know that the private sector and companies like Axon have a unique role to play. As I look at our team, which includes leaders like Josh and Britney I'm confident that they'll ensure we continue to invest prudently with a high degree of accountability to all of our stakeholders, driving the business model that creates impressive value creation, solves some of the most challenging problems facing modern society. and delivers great shareholder returns. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Josh. Josh, I would add to it as well. What I'm seeing with customers, I haven't -- I can't think of a customer that's been like gone up to a premium bundle and gone down the other direction, that the more stuff they use from us, the more value they see in it and very sort of the flywheel effect where what I'm hearing from customers is they just want to put more of their solutions with Axon. -- they struggle with technology. They're hamstrung by really long, complex procurement rules that make it very difficult for them to be agile in what they're doing. And so I think we've earned their trust and it's really incumbent on us to keep earning it every day. So we don't break this dynamic, but it does seem to me that they're pretty consistently moving up the ladder each time we launch something that integrates with the other stuff. It's paying off, it's working well. And again, a lot of that just goes to awesome execution and Jeff the product team. So I'll start and then maybe hand back over to Josh. I think investing to get that ramp accreditation for the Eves.com system early. It was a bit of a bet when we did it, right? It was expensive. It was difficult to invest in that. And I think to this day, we're still the only Fed ramp accredited or certified system and all these federal agencies that want to use the cloud, that obviously gives us a tremendous advantage. And then we've obviously seen things like the administration moving towards standardization with body cameras. And then Richard Collin, who we hired a few years ago, is really, I think, just done a great job building out a team that really understands the federal space and is building some fantastic relationships. Let me start first, and then I know Josh is going to want to talk to this, too. I would say this is where we see the advantage. We talk about being a mission-focused business. And a lot of times, that can sound like puffery or kind of fluff, but it really is true. We are running this business to solve problems we're passionate about. And of course, we also want to run a rigorous business where we have financial models that make sense. But the finance has come from the problems we solve and infusing that in every employee, I'm just so impressed with the team and the attitude they've got where it's all about keeping our customers productive and safe and happy, and we really give a lot of latitude to our teams to make things right. And where that pays off is we don't think of these as just contracts we're going to sell and make a few bucks to move on to the next one.  And so we get phenomenal customer references and the investments we make in really delivering a great product to the end user, not focusing on winning the bid RFP sort of bureaucratic process I think, builds the type of things where you see these relationships where people even relatively early on, they're cross checking with their other agency customers that are similar, and they're getting the confidence to give us a large part of their technology ecosystem. So I think that's the underlying thing is the focus of the team on really the passion around the business to build things that really delight and protect our customers that give customers the confidence to go do that. But I'll turn it over to Josh to maybe give a little more color to federal specifically. Let me jump in and help the I think, in particular, this Moonshot, right? One can look at that and say, okay, well, how do I tie that back to the commute return to the company? And what we're trying to do is push ourselves not to just think of, in particular, the TASER as a product that we're going to incrementally -- making marginally better than the last version, but how do we absolute the bullet?

So I think that sort of thinking is going to pay off in really break out moments of growth for us, particularly in the international space.  And then the other piece is the Cloud. We are hammering the way. It's taken longer than I thought it would in Europe, in particular, to get acceptance to the cloud over the same objections we saw in the U.S. a decade ago. We're seeing some bright spots and signs of light. And I think if we get 1 or 2 leading customers to crack and prove the cloud is safe, but we'll start to see the dam break there as well. So I'm particularly excited about the international opportunities led by TASER overall. Well, I'd say in many markets, the TASER is already a lead product. It tends to bring us, I think, into more markets because of its unique value proposition. But I think that will accelerate as we continue to step up its capability to move from a specialist capture tool to a highly reliable personal defense system.

            "name": "Brittany Bagley",
            "content": "Thank you, Josh. Hi, everyone. I'm thrilled to be on my first official Axon earnings call. I want to start with a big thank you to the team for making it such a great quarter and to Jim Zito for doing such a nice job in the interim CFO role. It's an exciting time to have joined such an incredible company. I'd like to share a little about why I joined and where you'll see me put my focus over the coming quarters. While there were many reasons to join, 3 main ones that I would like to highlight include the strong leadership team, the company is inspiring mission to protect life and the compelling business model.  On that last one, especially, I think the combination of the hardware ecosystem the company has been building along with innovative software solutions creates a powerful flywheel that is both high growth and profitable, which provides a relatively rare position in the technology world. Additionally, delivering mission-critical products to public safety customers who purchase on long-term contracts makes Axon's revenue both recurring and dependable. As Josh discussed, we continue to have a lot of growth in front of us, and I look forward to supporting our mission and a profitable growth trajectory.  To that point, my areas of focus will be on helping the team continue to execute and deliver strong results over the next several years. As both CFO and Chief Business Officer, I get to take a strategic and holistic view of the business to ensure we're making the right long-term decisions to deliver on our mission and our financial promise. Near term, that means spending time, better understanding Axon's gross margin potential and how I can help move the needle on other metrics we care about, including overall profitability and cash flow. We see opportunities to improve gross margin by investing in automation, driving manufacturing efficiency and improving fixed cost absorption as we scale. Driving the revenue mix further towards software is also a key gross margin lever over the longer term. We are also focusing on controlling OpEx by enhancing financial discipline while still investing in research and development and sales channel expansion to support future growth. In addition to leaning in on operational areas of the business, I am also focused on helping Axon to deliver upon its strategic ecosystem vision, leveraging partnerships, investments in M&A, to truly become the leading technology hub for public safety. Turning now to the quarter. Our domestic business grew 37% year-over-year in Q3 and continues to make up more than 80% of our revenue. This strength came across the board, supporting strong TASER segment growth at 19% along with great Software and Sensors segment growth at 51%, which was driven by Sensors growth of 51% and Axon Cloud growth, also at 51%. One of the great things we're seeing domestically is strong demand for the premium versions of our products and bundles. Beyond the strength in our core business and the traction we're seeing on our software and cloud revenue, we continue to be excited about other areas of growth, including our international business, which delivered 20% growth in Q3. We had a strong Q3 gross margin of 62%, which represented more than 100 basis points of sequential improvement. The increase was primarily due to the strength of Axon Cloud and the overall product mix in the quarter. Axon Cloud gross margin in Q3 benefited from our new long-term contract with Microsoft Azure. While this benefit will continue, we also have low to no margin professional services costs which supports the setup of these contracts and the mix can change quarter-to-quarter. That doesn't change our view on exceeding the long-term target of 80% plus for the software business, but we do expect quarterly variations as a result. In addition to the sequential gross margin improvement, the strong top line revenue allowed us to achieve good operating leverage in the quarter and resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $68 million or 21.7% margin. Finally, I wanted to touch on our outlook. Given the strong quarter, we are raising our annual revenue guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.16 billion, which reflects about 34% annual growth at the midpoint. This also implies Q4 annual revenue growth of 40% at the midpoint. Turning to our adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our outlook from $200 million to a range of $215 million to $220 million, which we believe demonstrates strong performance on profitability. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $49 million to $54 million. Implied margins are down slightly sequentially from Q3 on product mix and less OpEx leverage but remained strong overall with an almost 19% EBITDA margin implied at the midpoint for the year. We are proud of our performance and outlook, and they speak to the bigger picture that Rick and Josh talked about, which is the overall strength of the business we are building. We look forward to delivering another strong Q4 and setting ourselves up well for 2023 and as we execute against our financial objective of profitably delivering a 20%-plus top line CAGR going forward. With that, I would like to open it up to questions back to Andrea. Yes. I would say that we have been investing in everything related to our manufacturing capacity as well as supply chain for the TASER. And so you have seen that impact the gross margin this quarter and a little bit year-to-date. I think it will be 1 of the big areas of focus as we look to improve gross margins is making sure we can really scale into those costs and scale as we get leverage on ross margin over time. Yes. I mean I think the way we philosophically think about it is that we can achieve both really healthy top line growth and head towards that Moonshot. And do that profitably and have a really nice bottom line as part of the business. And so to your point, that will be a balance for us as we go forward. But of course, with our growth, we're not going to stop innovating. We're not going to stop investing in R&D. We're not going to stop coming up with great new products. And so it's just that a lot of those will be focused on helping achieve that mission, but all inside the financial profile that we think is the right long-term profile for the company. No. There's nothing specifically we're calling out on that. I do think we will continue to invest in R&D, and we've been consistent on saying that, but this wouldn't necessarily change that profile in a way we're calling out today. Thanks, Josh. I mean, I think the only thing I would add is I think it's exciting how many levers I see the business having in terms of where and how it can grow. There's an enormous amount of opportunity. So now you have to focus and make sure you're executing against them and going after the right ones, but the opportunity is there. I think from a CapEx standpoint, what we just highlighted is we are making some CapEx investments this year, and some of those are getting really pushed out to next year. It's more of a in a timing piece than a fundamental change in strategy. I'd say there are 2 things right now that are driving our inventory investments. One is, we are still not out of supply chain challenges. So we still have products that are supply constrained that we would like to get back in stock on and get to a better inventory position. And then I think, too, just with the types of growth we're seeing across some of our products, we need to continue to invest in inventory to support that top line growth.  So I do think you'll continue to see that be just a strategic area of investment. I think at the same time, one of the things I talked about is really making sure we are doing a good job with our free cash flow. And so as we get to '23, we'll have to work to make sure we're appropriately balancing strong free cash flow generation with making sure we have that inventory we need to support the top line. I think it's been a big area of focus. The team has done a nice job specifically stepping up what they've been doing from a collection standpoint and paying more attention to our accounts receivable. And so that's a lot of what gets us. I think as we go through the rest of the year to our free cash flow targets. And again, I think it's just -- of course, we need to balance with our inventory investments and making sure we're in the right place from that standpoint, making sure from a CapEx standpoint, we're investing in the business where we need to invest in the business. But there should be some good free cash flow characteristics that we can continue to focus on. Yes. Well, I'll start and then maybe I'll let Jeff jump in a little bit, but I get excited in a couple of places. One, there really is this incredible ecosystem that the company has created where the hardware and the software have a flywheel to benefit each other. You heard us talking about how more customers are buying the premium parts of our business. And so that's really proving out the software. And so I get excited that we can make investments in partnerships that continue to drive that ecosystem. At the same time, with my CFO hat, we're going to be thoughtful and we're going to be disciplined about where and how we invest but I really do think we have a unique opportunity in front of us with that as a lever to continue to pull things in. And I think what's great is the more you can bundle some of these products together, the more powerful each one is. And so it's just a great opportunity there. But Jeff, I know you spend a lot of time thinking through the ecosystem and products and where we should make investments. So if you want to add anything. Yes. So I think a couple of things going on in Q4 are we talked about having slightly less leverage on our OpEx -- we do continue to invest in OpEx as we head into the fourth quarter of the year. We have also talked a little bit about how it's still a very positive margin for the overall year. So we'll get to almost 19% EBITDA margins. But I think if you look at sort of last year to this year, what you really saw was gross margins came down year-over-year, and that's a lot of what was impacting our EBITDA margins year-over-year. So we actually have managed to get some OpEx leverage if you look at some of those numbers.  And so as we look and start thinking about what is that going to be like in the future, it's 1 of the main reasons that I'm really starting by digging into gross margins and where can we get some continued leverage in gross margins. That all can then flow through to the bottom line and support what we come out with in terms of longer-term EBITDA targets. We'll have more for you on '23 when we get to our Q4 earnings call, but really looking forward to digging in there and being able to provide some more of that color. Yes. No, I appreciate the question. I mean I would say I think that the business has been well run. And so I wouldn't say there's any glaring low-hanging fruit, but I would also say it's a business that's come through many of the supply -- well, still in many of the ongoing supply chain challenges. So -- the company has been paying PPV and having to invest in manufacturing capacity and automation and all things, I think, that have been talked about but should start to see some benefits going forward as we continue to grow, as we continue to get scale on some of those investments, hopefully as we get to a more normalized supply chain, you saw the growth in software, which is higher margin for us. So that product mix is very important going forward. I think all of those things are the things that we're going to need to do to drive gross margin improvement. I mean I think that we're certainly looking to get some good OpEx leverage as we continue to grow. But I also -- I don't want to leave you with the impression that we're not going to continue to invest in their growth because the opportunity in front of us is just so enormous you should all want us to be investing behind going after that. And so I think we're going to continue to be really thoughtful about where we do that and make sure we're getting a good return on those investment dollars, but both from an R&D standpoint and then some of these new channel opportunities are big and you're starting to see that pay off in federal. And so we would like to keep doing that and keep driving that top line growth, just doing that profitably and making sure there's a good balance there and a good focus on really getting return for the dollars we're investing."

            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Rick. During last quarter's call, I mentioned that the primary thing we can control is where we collectively focus our attention. Our sights remain set on continued top line growth, which I will address and margin expansion over the long term, which Britney will cover. We are increasingly confident that we can do both well in parallel. On the top line, we are very pleased with quarterly revenue of 34% and our Q4 outlook for 40% growth at the midpoint. We're having a strong year, and we are seeing a strengthening of demand across all product lines. Britney will unpack the revenue growth in the quarter for you shortly. But I'd like to take a moment to touch upon what we believe will sustain healthy growth rates of 20-plus percent for the years to come. We're growing along 2 axes. The first is expanding our product suite for existing customers. Both Rick and the shareholder letter talked about a product road map where we believe we can continue to deliver premium solutions to customers at a compelling value proposition for them. We want to make it super clear that our state and local law enforcement business is nowhere near saturated, and we see a long and wide runway for continued growth. We believe that in the next 5 years, you will see Axon emerge as the leading operating system for public safety, strengthened by our strategy of focusing on the customer experience and not cobbling together point solutions that don't work well together, which is the current state of the industry outside of Axon. The second axis is deferred buying into new markets by both adding new types of customer profiles or users and by adding to our core customer base. You can think of our core customers as falling into roughly 4 categories of funding sources, the U.S. state and local governments, the U.S. federal government, international government customers and commercial enterprises. Simultaneously, the types of users we are adding to our platforms is expanding beyond law enforcement. We are adding attorneys, fire and EMS personnel, corrections in the U.S. military and the funding for those types of users generally rolls up into the 4 sources I mentioned. I'd like to update you on 2 of those 4. First, our progress with the U.S. federal government and second, touch upon international growth. We are very excited about our U.S. federal government business. In the first 3 quarters of 2022, the federal government has booked contracts exceeding $200 million, up from an approximate $15 million to $20 million run rate just a few years ago. Annual revenue has grown to the tens of millions and our deliverables now extend over the next several years. Our progress with the federal government is a direct result of our intentional investments in both sales channel and product. We have been building trusted relationship with agencies that are now finding value in our products and missions and our commitment to helping them be successful. And while we can't necessarily name all of those customers, the breadth and depth of the federal government's interest in our entire product line continues to excite us. And now turning toward global expansion. We continue to refine our international go-to-market strategy. We see 2 things as being the drivers and even the accelerators to international growth. The first is continuing to innovate on our TASER platform. We believe the total TASER installed base has room to grow by more than 5x over time. And as we continue to develop technology that potentially matches a pistol in terms of stopping power, we think we have the opportunity to become the primary defense weapon in several international markets. The second thing we are focusing on is helping European customers overcome their historical resistance to cloud solutions. This is a playbook we ran in the U.S. starting in around 2012. And domestic state and local customers at first were very averse to cloud-hosted software, and we successfully evangelized the cloud to build a business that now tops $400 million in annual recurring revenue. We are starting to chip away at cloud acceptance in the EU, and we see European governments starting to adopt other commercial services for cloud, and we believe that this bodes well for our international SaaS business. Just like in the U.S., once we overcome that initial version, strong adoption of evidence management will follow. Finally, last quarter, I told you that I am working on building the team that Axon needs for the next 5 to 10 years. We are thrilled to introduce Brittany Bagley, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Business Officer. She brings a wealth of experience not only as a public company CFO, but also as a seasoned board member and investor in the technology segment. We sought to attract an executive who brings a NexPlay mindset, versatility, mental toughness and a strong capability to deliver outside outcomes and we are excited that Britney brings all of those qualities to Axon. Based on working with Britney over the last 40 days, I can say with confidence and excitement that the future of Axon's core strategic and financial functions is very, very bright. Now I'll hand it over to Brittany. Yes. I don't -- Josh, I appreciate the question and nice to see you again. I don't necessarily think there's a ton of correlation between our momentum and results in any onetime or kind of recurring government subsidy for products. I think ultimately, we're building a very strong business where there's a very high ROI on our products and our customers continue to see that and not only buy more of them, but buy more and more premium levels and licenses. And so while those are nice moment in time types of tailwinds for some customers, I don't think they have any major implication on our continued growth, and we're very confident that independent of those factors, we're building a very strong and consistent business. Yes. Certainly, Jonathan. I think the first thing I'd say on those bundles is even though we're seeing a lot of demand, there's a white space ahead of us in terms of adoption of those bundles, especially in state and local, and it's really driven by the adoption is driven by the idea that in those bundles, we're adding more and more value-added add-ons.  And so Jeff's team is doing a fantastic job understanding accidental contact -- sorry about that. The I think Jeff's team is doing a great job understanding some of what the customers are wanting in future releases of our products and then going back and building those things that are highly valuable. An example of that is transcription. And another example is VR, both of which exist in our more premium version of the Officer Safety Plan, and that's driving a lot of customers toward those bundles. And so we'll continue to iterate on that strategy and make sure that the things that are the most highly valued in tandem with our core products appear and bundles in a way that make the customer excited about the potential of buying all of these items and features at 1 time and 1 license. Yes. I'd just add to that, Rick, especially on the last point. For us, every problem starts with how do we build a strong team, full of subject matter experts that we can trust there instincts and expertise to execute. And when we brought Richard in, that was 2 years into our business, and we haven't quite cracked the code on how to run a growing federal business and just bringing him on along with a very talented team with him as well as more and more product focus has just unlocked this amazing opportunity and even though we've had a phenomenal year and seen a literal 10x in bookings at this point in the last few years, we still think we're very much on our own side of the field and have a long way to go to maximize the full opportunity across federal, but we really believe we have the team in place to do that. I think Jeff was going to chime in first, Rick. . And I'd just add, finally, I think, to your question about fleet specifically, Eric, in federal, I think is we'll have 1 or 2 products off the bat that are nice fits for the customer and expand for lack of a better term from there. And then there will be other customers that see the value across the board in terms of what we offer and want to engage in a more extensive contract upfront. I think we still maintain the belief that either way, longer term, the customer ends up in the same place, which is very happy with Axon's full suite of products. And the VA is a great example of an agency that trust us on day 1 to deliver all of it. And in some other cases, we'll see that same phenomenon over time. Yes. Certainly, Keith. And I don't necessarily want to speculate on what the quarter could have been. We're really proud of where we landed. But I think it is an indicator that the future looks bright for a variety of reasons, including increased fleet shipments. We did run into 1 or 2 minor items with the hubs that power our fleet unit from our supplier, but the good news is in Q4, you'll see that demand rebound substantially, and we expect to see our best ever shipment of fleet -- quarter of shipments for fleet specifically in Q4 and the strong demand continues well into the future there. And we're very excited to continue to build on our market lead in that product line. Sure. I'll start with the revenue growth question and then hand it over to Brittany for the CapEx question. I think, Sami, there's -- one of the beauties of our business and business model is there's a lot of different ways we can achieve exciting growth -- and it's not 1 specific thing. I think there are -- some of the things you mentioned are very much in play. We'll continue to invest in new products that delight customers and cause customers to want to buy more at higher pricing tiers and more premium bundles. But I think it really bought boils down to 2 specific things.  One is -- we're going to do a really good job of building new products for our existing customer base, meaning state and local U.S., especially, how do we introduce new products into that base over time. And the second one is applying existing products to newer markets like international, federal and enterprise. And we really believe -- we're doing those things well in parallel, and we'll do them even better in parallel next year. And of course, by doing so, that opens up kind of growth opportunity on both of those axes. So I'll probably leave it at that for now and hand it over to Brittany for the CapEx question. . Yes, certainly, Will, nice to see you again. I think it's really just a combination of a few things driving more users to our more premium licenses, expanding our user base to more software-only use cases outside of kind of core state and local, you mentioned attorneys, that's certainly a big one, and there are others along that same realm -- and then just increased overall adoption across Evidence.com even within state and local, we continue to add users every quarter, and we see some of that also in federal and international and enterprise as well. So goes back to really focusing on selling more into our existing markets and then opening up new markets in parallel, and that's 1 of the places we're seeing some of the results. And of course, there's a lot more work to do there as well. Sure. I think generally speaking, the focus, Eric, is really to land with 1 product, whether it's on the CEW side, the video side, interview room, in-car video, any of our digital evidence management products, and there we'll bet on ourselves to continue to grow the adoption and numbers and volume of that 1 product, but we'll also grow the adoption and volume of other products along the way.  So right now, we still remain focused on doing everything we can to grow in the U.K. and Canada and Australia being our Tier 1 international markets, but also just finding 1 product to fit in all of these other large national police forces and from their supplement with our additional products. And I think it's working well. We've seen a lot of interesting TASER adoption this year in markets where we haven't really participated before, but we also see a tremendous pipeline going into next year and the year after, not only across TASER, but across body cams and cloud. So we're very excited about the prospects of international, and it's really about that land and expand strategy that we talked about earlier in the call. I think that covers it, Rick. Yes. Logan, I appreciate the question, and thanks a lot. I don't know that we're going to go into that level of detail right now. I'd say our focus in federal continues to remain on growing bookings and total contract value, with the expectation is that flows to the top line and revenue not only upfront as those contracts are signed, but over time. But at this point, we're not prepared to break out federal revenue. And maybe we'll reassess later. But at the moment, we're stick with the way we're reporting it. We do expect Q4 to be our highest bookings quarter of the year for sure and maybe even ever depending on a few factors there. So we're certainly excited about it, but that's the extent to which we'll elaborate on that right now."

These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today and are not guarantees of future performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are discussed in our SEC filings. And before we go to Rick, we will open with our earnings video. [Video Presentation]\nRick Smith: Awesome. All right. Well, I will launch in. Andrea, and Angel, great job, as always, on the quarterly video, that's fantastic. Great way to share all the exciting stuff with our shareholders. Okay. We're executing on what is shaping up to be a really excellent year. And our confidence in our growth extends well beyond 2022. We emerged from the pandemic and civil unrest of 2020 in our strongest position ever. And now we're fortunate to be able to leverage that position and strength, while many parts of the economy are experiencing uncertainty. We're seeing broad-based strength across our product numbers, and we're really energized by the growing number of agencies that are buying nearly everything we offer and signing up for 10-year contracts, sometimes even 12 years. It's exciting to see an agency go all in with Axon. We set a vision several years ago that an agency wouldn't just say, well, we have a TASER device or maybe we have body cameras and Evidence.com, but would instead simply describe Axon as their technology partner. And that's starting to happen now. When agencies sign up for all of our software solutions, plus our body camera, dash camera, the TASER 7, the VR training, our drone solution and so on. Customers are increasingly demonstrating their confidence that we are the right technology partner for them for the next decade. We made it easy for our customers to bet on us, because our team delivers. Now on to some other hours. We expect profitability to improve in the back half of this year. We expect to drive increased leverage coming out of Q2, when we had some expenses that won't repeat, more on that coming from Jim in a moment. Also, we recently launched an internal campaign called, spend it like it's yours to climb down on some low-hanging fruits such as travel expenses and swap. In fact, we created a new position of pointing a swag czar who must approve all purchases. Being scrappy is not new to Axon. We're just taking it to another level of rigor. I was recently quoted in the Wall Street Journal as last week saying, it's good to go on a swag detox. Not every event needs a T-shirt, and we need to balance the need to travel against what we can do over Zoom, such as maybe sending one or two key representatives to be in the room and having others join online. We're continuing though to hire and invest in this environment, and we're disciplined about it.  Our bar for talent continues to move higher, where we have seen other technology companies slowdown their hiring that presents us with opportunity. And you'll see some of that in our increased headcount spending in the second quarter. Thinking back to 2008 in that downturn, we invested in creating the cloud and body camera business, while our competitors were pulling back.  The results of that decision are measured in billions of market cap. I say ages favor the adaptable and we see times like these when the work for talent pools as an opportunity to advance our mission, so will come out of far stronger and more competitive. Our commitment to generating strong cash flow and operational discipline is shared among the entire leadership team. You'll see in our shareholder letter that we've revised our expected capital expenditures this year to reflect slower pacing on our net campus investments. We're adjusting our pacing to reflect a world that is still in flux, as we determine the best and highest use of the campus, optimizing for the new world of hybrid work, as well as the best and highest uses for our capital. It's more important that we get it right than we get it fast and we are preserving optionality. Finally, I feel great about the trajectory of our C-suite. Since our last call, Josh Isner was appointed COO; and Isaiah Fields an 11-year earn veteran of Axon was promoted to our Chief Legal Officer. Also, we've made a lot of progress with our CFO search, which Josh will highlight in a little bit more detail. In the meantime, Interim CFO, Jim Zito, hasn't missed a beat.  Before turning over the call to Josh, let me take a moment to share my thoughts about Josh's leadership skills. First, Josh's promotion to COO was really a natural progression for him and for Axon. Josh has been a rockstar since the day he got here, and he exudes sheer confidence. He built the revenue stream and embodies our core value to own it. For the past 7 years, Josh has owned quarterly revenue delivery, where he's helped us establish an excellent track record. Josh is highly focused on delivering results and executing and exhibits excellent discernment. I'm thrilled with our partnership and our working dynamics. We have a rigorous and healthy back and forth, and I'm very confident in his leadership during the next phase of rapid growth. And with that, now let me turn it over to Josh Isner.\nJosh Isner: Thanks a lot, Rick. I appreciate that and it's good to see everybody. In my new role, I'm humbled by the trust our team, our customers and our shareholders have placed in me. We are working hard every day to deliver on our mission and drive exciting growth in tandem with margin expansion. Here's what that looks like in terms of where I'm investing my time and focus.  First, I'm working on building a world-class team from top to bottom. as opposed to focusing on simply filling the needs of today, I'm working with our leadership team to build the team we need for the next 5 to 10 years. We will focus on a next play mindset, versatility, mental toughness and the capability to deliver outsized outcomes as the core characteristics of our team. That starts with the search for our new CFO. We have made a lot of progress in this area, and we are very excited about the candidates that we have attracted. We hope to have someone to announce shortly that I am personally thrilled about. As Rick said, I couldn't be happier about the partnership we've had with Jim. His steady leadership has allowed us to take our time with the search for a permanent CFO. He has been the consummate teammate and done whatever the team has asked. I sincerely appreciate Jim's leadership. Second, I'll be driving discipline and prioritization across the business. The one thing each of us truly controls is where we focus our attention. We have a lot of exciting opportunities to go after. And as you all know, we will unlock maximal value by focusing our efforts only in the areas where we can have the most impact and deliver the most value for our customers. That is the optimal path for shareholder value creation as well. For every opportunity we say yes to, we will say no to dozens. And when we do say yes, we will win. From there, our job is to block out the noise and execute. Third, I will be ensuring that we are aggressively pursuing our total addressable market opportunity. We value that at $52 billion, and it continues to grow as Axon unveils new products and unlocks new markets. We view our channel as one of Axon's core differentiators, and we will continue to invest into new geographies and customer segments such as commercial enterprises, federal and adjacent markets. We will also be scaling our VR, drones, records and dispatch businesses. For every single one of our product lines, our best days are ahead. That includes the TASER business, which is changing the world for the better and it's just getting started internationally. I think you're going to be very pleased with what you see unfold here over the next couple of years. And finally, the entire management team is looking forward to turning on the free cash flow spigot over the next several quarters, which opens up a lot of options for us as a company. This is totally within our control, and we are implementing a plan to optimize the level of execution in this area. We can do a lot better here. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jim.\nJim Zito: Thanks, Rick and Josh. Hello, everyone. It's great to see you again. We had an excellent quarter, as you can see in our shareholder letter. Let me put some context around the results and how we are thinking about our outlook. Top line momentum continued with growth of over 30%, and gross margin improved sequentially. We delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $50 million, a margin of about 17.5% largely reflecting some expenses that were unique to this quarter. Let me unpack that for you. During the second quarter, we spent about $1 million on Axon ACCELERATE, our annual user conference, which has become strategically important to our sales pipeline, technology leadership and ecosystem expansion. Additionally, we committed more than $3 million in incremental mid-year bonuses to employees at the senior director level and below. This was an intentional decision given the team over delivering on results in an environment where inflation was impacting their lives. We did so precisely because we had line of sight to stronger-than-expected revenue, both in the quarter and in the back half of the year, which is reflected in our updated outlook. We are especially pleased that we could issue this bonus without affecting our projected adjusted EBITDA margin percentage for the year. The fundamental strength of our business allowed us to demonstrate our commitment both to our shareholders and to the team members who work so hard for our customers. With that context on the quarter, we are already focusing on moderating expense growth going forward to help drive adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Our working capital needs were $23 million in the quarter, and we have already started to see some of that reverse in July, which is driving us to maintain our full year adjusted free cash flow outlook. Finally, I'd really like to highlight our commentary in the shareholder letter about our technology partner ecosystem, which was exciting to see in action this past May at ACCELERATE. In June, we renewed our strategic technology partnership with Microsoft Azure, who will continue to be the primary host of our software platform and cloud. This is a great partnership for us in many ways. Microsoft is a global leader in cloud technology. Of course, they need no introduction. Our customers trust Microsoft and thereby feel secure putting their data into our cloud. As part of the renewal, we extended our contract term for another six years, which gives us long-term pricing certainty and cost visibility for our Axon Cloud business. The renewal supports our software gross margin target of more than 80% and also paves the way for faster international cloud expansion without diluting this target. And what's also excellent about this partnership is the ability it affords us to offer pricing predictability to our own customers. So it's just a winning deal all around. We also highlighted several of our ecosystem partners in strategic investments during our Accelerate conference and in today's letter. The investments we make are driven by our long-term product strategy, which is set under the leadership of Rick, Chief Product Officer, Jeff Kunins, and Josh. Our corporate development team led by Andrea has been a key thought partner in enabling Axon to grow into its role as the definitive technology hub for public safety. We take pride in our approach to identifying emerging market leaders in the high-value sectors that we know well, integrating their solutions with ours and combining them with the power of our direct sales channel and deep customer relationships. Importantly, the structures our corporate development team has negotiated on behalf of Axon provide us with significant flexibility and optionality on the investments we make. The ability to obtain customer feedback experiment with product integrations and see how our teams work together, allows us to preserve optionality for our business, delight our customers and expand our technology ecosystem in a highly efficient way. And with that, Andrea, let's take questions.\nA - Andrea James: All right. Thanks. Here, we all are in gallery. We will take our first question from Will Power at Baird. Go ahead, Will, you're up.\nWill Power: All right. Great. Thanks, Andrea. I propose the two that maybe the next Analyst Day would be at the racetrack and we can help you test ALPR. I'd like a couple of quick questions. The cloud growth continues to be strong. Obviously, Evidence.com is a key component of that. But I'd love to unpack any of the other kind of key drivers there. What are you seeing with record management, any of the other kind of key pieces of the software portfolio, what does the traction of trends look like?\nJosh Isner: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Will, and nice to see you again. I'd say for us, we've talked about this a lot in the video. I mentioned our flywheel for us. The biggest thing we can be doing quarter-to-quarter is driving the number of officer safety plan subscriptions up. That bundles essentially all our products outside of dispatch that we sell \u2013 sorry, dispatch and fleet. And it provides optionality for customers to opt into records, but it \u2013 it provides a nice base for ARR between the license, all the software add-ons, the TASER, the virtual reality. And so for us, that's really the major focus in our state and local business is to drive as many renewals and purchases of that plan as we can. In addition to that, I think we are seeing exciting growth in some of our newer segments, one of which is federal, another is international. And then even in newer ones like justice and corrections, we're seeing an uptick. And so I'd say, all of those are combining to just provide a lot of wind in our back, as we go on here and we certainly still feel like our best days are in front of us.\nWill Power: That's great. Josh, maybe just one more for you. As you look at the international opportunity in front of you, any perspective on how the macro climate is or isn't impacting sales cycles, demand trends, et cetera, that's kind of the broader question. And then number two, tied to international in your prepared remarks, it sounds like you're feeling better and better about the TASER opportunity. What -- maybe just any other color or perspective what's driving that optimism?\nJosh Isner: Yes, absolutely. So internationally, in general, to answer your first question, I don't think we're seeing any kind of macro impacts at this point in terms of adoption, interest, buying cycles and so forth. I think we've performed in the TASER segment. We are seeing national police forces by larger order quantities of TASERs than we've seen in the past, which is really exciting. Because when we're talking about a national police force, five, six, seven times the size of NYPD and they're starting their purchases and in the thousands, the high four digits into five-digit, thousands of units of orders, like it's very exciting, because we know that we're very good at kind of the land and expand type of playbook. And so, we look at these as really good indicators for the future of our TASER business, and we do -- we are working with more and more national police forces across the world. And I'd say on top of that, our execution in our Tier 1 markets, the UK, Canada and Australia has been really strong, where we continue to see more adoption of Evidence.com and body cams, but also kind of our newer features on Evidence.com like real-time streaming and transcription. And so, the next step for us internationally is going to repeat -- is going to be to repeat that same level of execution in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. And there, we've got to do a really good job of evangelizing the cloud and helping customers understand why the cloud is far, far better as a mechanism for storing and sharing digital evidence. And so, we're working through that process. We'll continue to build there. But we're really excited about all the work our International team is doing and they're really focused right now on driving the results upward.\nWill Power: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Erik Suppiger from JMP. Go ahead, Erik.\nErik Suppiger: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Good quarter here. One, I don't know if you said this, but can we assume that backlog grew from the end of Q1 to the end of Q2, or how should we think about some of the backlog that you carried in from Q4 into Q1? And did that roll into Q2? And then, secondly, any comments about supply constraints? Did that improve or where are we from a supply-constrained -- supply chain constraint perspective?\nJosh Isner: I can still -- \nJim Zito: I take the first half of that. I guess, yes, so we can disclose future contracted revenue, Erik, in the letter. So that grew to $3.3 billion. So it was up versus a little bit less than $3 billion as of the end of Q2. And then, yes, there's really no -- nothing -- in Q4, we had some unfulfilled demand that rolled into the first half of the year, but we're sort of back to more normalized levels, obviously, quarter-to-quarter order inflows. And I guess, Josh, do you want to take the supply chain, please?\nJosh Isner: Sure, thing. And I'd just add to that, just traditionally in the back half, revenue performed stronger than the first half. So we're -- we see plenty of demand still and certainly are going to execute against that demand. In terms of supply chain, in general, our supply chain team has been one of our top- performing teams at Axon. As you can see in other businesses, companies are getting hit hard by supply chain constraints. Our team has just done a masterful job navigating through some of those challenges. And frankly, this is one of the reasons we do keep some inventory on the shelves to get through periods like we've had over the last few quarters. And so we think at this point, things look better and better each quarter. Like we do feel that we're through the worst of it, and that will continue to be able to build the supply orders, but also start to build a little buffer there as well on our TASER and core body camera lines.\nErik Suppiger: Would you care to guess as to timing when supply chain might be relatively normalized? Any thoughts where we'll be as we enter 2023?\nJosh Isner: Well, at this point, I don't think we're guessing. We're just executing against our plan. And I think by the end of this year, we'll certainly see some buffer in the TASER 7 and AB 3 or Axon Body 3 product lines. And from there, I think it will just be about optimizing the level of inventory we keep on the shelves. And so from an investor results perspective, I wouldn't plan on seeing any kind of abnormal activity in either product shipped or inventory backlogs.\nErik Suppiger: Great. Thank you.\nAndrea James : Great. Thank you. Next question is Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Go ahead, Sami.\nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you. You made a reference earlier, maybe it was Rick, regarding profitability being better in the second half of 2022. And I think you just made a reference that second half revenue growth is -- or at least second half revenue production is usually better than the first half. So is there a specific segment or a product that's seeing very good profitable dynamics in the second half that's kind of giving you guys that operating leverage? That's the first question. The second question is the free cash flow guidance was reiterated and unchanged for the fiscal year 2022, but it looks like there were some changes in CapEx. Could you kind of give us the puts and takes on that?\nJosh Isner: Sure thing. I'll talk briefly about the free cash flow element there. Remind me of your first question, Sami.\nSami Badri: Products that are enabling better profitability in the second half of 2022.\nJosh Isner: Yes, I'll take those two, and then I'll kick it over to Rick on the campus piece as well. So in general, I think we see stronger bookings in the back half of each year, and that's really across all products. This is the end of -- sorry, Q3 is the end of the fiscal year for several major markets in the US. It's also the federal government's end of their fiscal year. So, a combination of budgets ending and having some money to spend. And then the new budget starting, if there's a line item for our products, it tends to be a pretty active part of the year. And so I'd say, the big driver of profitability is the TASER business, and we expect exciting results there. But really across the board, we do see a lot of upside in the back half of the year. And in terms of free cash flow, I'd just say, we've reiterated our guidance, because we feel like, frankly, coming from sales, this to me is not all that different than inside sales. We've got to get in touch with customers, have a process we follow, have well-trained people on the phone, get commitments, follow-up on those commitments and then just get to the point of real predictability there. And I think Jim and I are partnering together there, and we've just brought in a new AR leader, I'm personally investing time with our accounts receivable team to build a playbook here where we can really measure efficiency and productivity. But this -- again, this one is really within our control. And when we couple that like you mentioned, Sami, with a better EBITDA, both dollars and margins in the back half of the year, there's a lot of opportunity to improve free cash flow in the back half, and we're really focused on it, and that's what we're going to do. And so I'll kick it over to Rick to talk about the new campus.\nRick Smith: Yeah. Thanks, Josh. So earlier this year, we projected an accelerating spend on the new campus. We've -- now we're basically telling you we're going to slow that down. We're pacing it out a bit. There have been a number of things. I'd say one of them is just the inflationary environment. What we've seen as we were getting ready to really move forward with more of the significant build-out on the campus, construction costs are just up pretty dramatically. And when we couple that with, we've also seen COVID resurging, I think, even more than people had expected. And we looked at the whole return to work dynamic, we've come to accept that the future is going to be hybrid work. And so we also see opportunity to really look at what is the best use of the overall land, really optimizing for collaborative events, customer centric events, of course, the land that we need and the space we need for manufacturing and warehousing and all that. But maybe shifting the balance away from the idea of people coming into the office so much and really more the hybrid work environment. And then in this environment as well, like there's a lot going on, and we just wanted to preserve some optionality of our cash. So we basically -- let's slow down a little bit, let's really recalibrate and see what the post-COVID world looks like and let took the building cost cool off a little bit, and now give us a little time to just keep tuning and refining. The world is in a pretty constant state of flux and we'd rather take our time to make sure we get it right.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nAndrea James: All right. Next up, Keith Housum with Northcoast. Go ahead, Keith.\nJosh Isner: Hey, Keith, it looks like you're on mute.\nKeith Housum: Sorry. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Looking at the TASER gross margins and your commentary regarding improvement in the second half of the year, I mean, previously, I think the manufacturing automation was going to happen when you're going to build the campus, but it sounds like things are changing. Perhaps touch on what your plans are for the second half of the year of improving the automation in the manufacturing process?\nJim Zito: Yeah. I would say that's not fully dependent on the campus headquarters. We're already starting to build out that automation. I think part of what we're seeing in the first half was really pressure in terms of growing into our expanded manufacturing footprint. So we've been investing to build out the footprint and capacity to build. And I think as we grow into those build plans, I think we'll see better overhead absorption in there. And I think that's not contingent upon the new building.\nKeith Housum: Got you. And then the professional services part that hurt the software and sensor gross margins. Was that in advance of the CAD and the systems you're putting in, or where was that spending being done?\nJim Zito: I think it covers CAD, RMS are the software pieces, but there's a heavy fleet portion as well. So fleet -- there was a big uptick in terms of fleet install. So all those things together lead to that PSO revenue becoming a slightly bigger portion of the cloud revenue, but that's enabling that high-margin software cloud revenue growth as well. So it's set the groundwork for future growth. But I think PSO is an important part of us controlling that customer experience and really getting sticky customers.\nKeith Housum: Okay. Thanks Jim. Appreciate it.\nAndrea James: All right. Awesome. Thank you so much. Next question from Jonathan Ho at William Blair. Go ahead, Jonathan.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to understand, first of all, with your headcount increases, can you talk a little bit about where you're making sort of those incremental hires? And what sort of changed for you to want to make those hires now? I think you referenced a better hiring environment, but just curious in terms of your thinking.\nJosh Isner: Yes, absolutely. I think, look, the last couple of years, we've hired very, very aggressively across all segments of the business. And now -- we're starting in a lot of places to grow into that size and not need to hire as aggressively. But the one major exception to that is in product. I think from our perspective, we have a lot of great ideas, and we limit those -- what we do based on where we think we have the most upside and also the size of our team and what our team can take on. And so for us, as long as there's talented engineers, product managers on the market that can help us deliver product faster and build products that we feel can really change our outcomes in public safety, we're going to keep investing there. And so I think going into next year, the mindset is going to be -- get a little leaner in terms of our hiring plans in SG&A and continue to be aggressive where we can in R&D.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about some of the cost savings initiatives that you referenced, either on the T&E side or other areas. Can you talk a little bit about maybe philosophically, where you're seeing that opportunity, the spend as if it's your own, I know I'm not saying that right, but that campaign -- yes, I just want to understand, like do you feel like there was maybe lack of oversight there in the past, or is this a situation where you're just trying to tighten the belt a little bit. Thank you.\nJosh Isner: I think it's -- I'm not sure it's a lack of oversight. I think certainly, we've got very good controls and process in place to measure expenses. But I think at times, we've gotten just a little bit bloated in how we think about things from the number of people that attend meetings with customers like Rick mentioned, or Swag is another obvious one, where we have -- and maybe the absence of being in the office, we've used Swag as a way to kind of connect with our employees. And so I think there's just opportunities to \u2013 to get a little more efficient in those places. It's not necessarily an indictment of anyone or anything we've done in the past. It's just more like the landscape has changed a little bit. We see all this exciting revenue growth well into the future. And it's just a matter of getting leverage out of that growth where we can without impacting our employee sentiment at Axon. And I think we can read that needle very effectively.\nRick Smith: Yes. Let me jump in and add it as well. Like a business like any community can't sort of have all messages all resonate all at the same time. And so you go through cycles, several years ago, we had a scrappy year where -- that was an opportunity for us to lead and say, okay, this is the year we want people to really like it's very similar what we did we spend it like pictures, like old be scrappy was, hey, we want to focus in on finding ways to more efficiently get things done and where more people are being scrappy and not throwing a body at every problem.  We've had a fair number of new employees come in. And certainly, we have our standard expense controls and training, but we felt with what's happening, look, the overall market is down, inflation is up other companies are, I'd say, more aggressively cutting back their investment plans. We saw this as an opportunity to communicate with our employees say, 'Hey, spend it like it's ours, right? Like this is a moment, let's take what's going outside, everyone has things in your control where you cut back spending. And by doing that, we'll all be rewarded. The market is rewarding companies that have more financial rigor, and we can also reward you by investing and not having to pull back on our investment plans and the exciting things we want to go build. But we can't just be toned up and continue as if the macro environment hasn't shifted. So, I think this was a balanced way for us to connect with -- maybe even some of the angst our employees are feeling about the macro environment, like, hey, here's something you can do really buckle down on expenses so we can continue to invest over here because we know these are the times those investments really pay off. Our hiring has accelerated, and I think a big part of that is it's the macro environment. We don't have as many competitors. We're having more success recruiting because we're just not competing with as many other tech companies that are as aggressive right now. And so these are the times we want to lean in and accelerate our growth. So, I hope that gives a little bit of context as to how we felt we could position us with the company employees to really get them all rolling in the same direction.\nJim Zito: The fact one thing I'd probably add to that too is just like overall travel costs, as like everybody is seeing, also went up sort of at the same time as we sort of dealt with that sort of pent up post pandemic demand. And I think as Rick said, we adjust to sort of how the best way to operate in the most efficient ways from a travel and hybrid perspective going forward. I think we'll thread the needle a little bit better in terms of meeting that. And I think everybody's plays are focused on that.\nAndrea James: All right. Awesome. Josh Riley at Needham, you're up next.\nJosh Riley: All right. Thanks Andrea for the questions. So, TASER revenues, obviously, were very strong in the quarter, quite a bit above what we were modeling. You touched on this a bit, but how much of the back orders you expected at the end of last year to be complete? I think you had mentioned previously by the first half or now through, I think you mentioned it was like $30 million. And then can you remind us if there's any seasonality to TASER shipments and if that could affect Q3 or Q4 TASER revenue just so we have an idea sequentially.\nJosh Isner: Yes, absolutely, Josh. Thanks for the question. So, I'd say it's fair to say we're caught up on the TASER shipments from Q4 last year and we've shipped those over Q1 and Q2. And because sequentially, TASER shipments go up in the back half of the year that we still feel like Q3 and Q4 will be the highlights of the year revenue-wise. And so I think that's kind of the story Q4 tends to be a little a little higher than Q3, but over the years, we've seen the inverse of that as well. But as a back half, we certainly have a lot of confidence that will outpace the first half of this year in revenue.\nJosh Reilly: Got it. That's super helpful. And then on the Axon Fleet units, those increased nicely as well quarter-over-quarter. Should we assume that all of those are Fleet 3 at this point, or are you still shipping any Fleet 2? And then how should we think about the level of supply constraint versus demand from that product?\nJosh Isner: Yes. In terms of the mix of fleet, there's still a little bit of Fleet 2, but mainly Fleet 3 and of course, a lot of body camera shipments going out. Supply chain constraints, I'd say, we have plenty of supply to deliver on our guidance in the back half of the year. Product-by-product, when we get outside of the core TASER and body camera products, there's a little bit of flux month-to-month there. But in a macro sense, we are feeling great about where we stand from an inventory perspective.\nJosh Reilly: Awesome. Thanks guys.\nAndrea James: All right. Jeremy Hamblin from Craig-Hallum. Go ahead Jeremy\nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the strong momentum in the business. So federal contract's clearly a pretty key segment right now, really a big driver of the business, a ton of momentum there. I wanted to get a sense for whereas we've seen executive order mandating federal agencies to use body cams. I wanted to get a sense for what you're seeing internationally in terms of that type of mandate, that type of adoption. Typically, there's been a decent lag period between instituting that type of policy. But there have been significant incidents, both in English-speaking world as well as other places with surprises incidents. Japan comes to mind, where we wanted to get a sense for what the pulse is of other government agencies around the globe.\nJosh Isner: Yeah. I think it's a good question, Jeremy. And as you'd expect, it varies a little bit. I can say, just like the United States, Canada, Australia and the UK were relatively early adopters of body cams. So even if a mandate were to come down at this point, I think, I don't know that, it would change the buying behavior all that much in those three markets. I think the market has decidedly already shifted to body cameras there. In other markets, we're starting to see \u2013 I position it like international governments are starting to dip their toe a little bit into the body camera world and start to understand kind of what's going to work for them and what's not. And so I think we do have a lot of opportunity there. First, with kind of small and mid-sized orders and then growth over time and so that's the \u2013 that's really where we see kind of international going in terms of body cameras. But like I mentioned, we are seeing international governments start to deploy TASERs with a lot more conviction around the globe, and we should expect to see that continue for the years to come.\nJeremy Hamblin: As a follow-up question, domestically, federal contracts, in terms of the value that you're getting in those deals, right? You're talking about a huge buyer, a buyer that's been mindful to look at getting best pricing, et cetera. So I wanted to understand, in terms of length of contracts there and kind of the value you're getting the ASPs. How that compares, obviously, without getting into exact specifics, but just understanding that a little bit in terms of that buyer.\nJosh Isner: And is that for international, specifically?\nJeremy Hamblin: No, domestically.\nJosh Isner: Oh, domestically. Okay. What was that, Rick?\nRick Smith: I think the question was about our federal buyers.\nJosh Isner: Oh, federal. Okay. Federally mirrors \u2013 our federal government is generally mirroring what our state and local customers are doing pricing-wise. Certainly, we do have some commitments to make sure that we are recognizing the federal government and the most favored nations clauses in some of those contracts. But ultimately, we do feel pretty good that those license types and sizing is similar to what we see. And far, far ahead of where our \u2013 when our state and local customers started to buy in large volumes, like the federal government has kind of skipped that phase of basic licenses and TAP and they're buying a lot more frequently at higher license types, which is exciting.\nRick Smith: Yeah. And I would add, Josh, as well that we're starting to now invest in dedicated federal R&D. So in many cases, we're seeing the Fed customers interested in premium sort of features that might require a little more investment in certain types of hardening of different devices or software to meet certain federal requirements that in some cases, can even lead to premium pricing.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks for the color. Best wishes.\nRick Smith: Thanks.\nAndrea James: [Operator Instructions] So we'll take our last question from Erik Lapinski at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead Erik.\nErik Lapinski: Thank you. I just maybe wanted to follow up on the federal market and some of the comments you guys just made there. I'm curious in terms of just the bundling that you're seeing in the federal market. Are you seeing similar uptake of OSP 7 Plus? I know that a number of agencies already have TASERs. So are they looking at body camera contracts kind of separately or bundling when you see those deals, I'd be curious on kind of what it looks like?\nJosh Isner: Yes, a great question, Erik. I'd say we're seeing kind of department by department, a little bit of everything. I think the agencies, you mentioned that agencies already have tasers, a lot of those are up for upgrades. So it's a great time to buy our body cameras and software and bundle those \u2013 that upgraded version of the Taser in -- with that contract.  Other customers are buying software-only, our investigator package for certain customers in the federal government. And then some standalone activity as well. The 1 really in -- there's a lot of really encouraging things here, but one of them that stands out is customers are also buying across our suite of products. They're seeing use cases for live streaming. They're seeing use cases for records, they're seeing fleet 3 interest.  And so really across the board, we're seeing a lot of interest and a lot of different products from the federal government. And it's really a credit to the work Richard Coleman, our Head of Federal and his team have done, it's really kind of transformed over the last few years from kind of a steady state market into an exponentially growing one.\nErik Lapinski: Thank you. That's helpful. And if I could sneak in another one. I know the corrections market is kind of another expansion area for you guys that we didn't talk that much about this quarter. I'd be curious if just any \u2013 whether it's from funding initiatives you're tracking or kind of just what the states are looking at in terms of the corrections market. If you're seeing more of an uptake there, if it's kind of -- I know there have been a couple of early presence there, over the past couple of quarters, but just in terms of kind of building on top of that?\nJosh Isner: Yes. The team is definitely growing. And for us, I think it's more of a -- it's less about the federal government giving grants or fundings or any kind of overall market effects there. I think it's more just \u2013 historically, we haven't really had a team focused on corrections as its own market. We really did a lot of correction sales through the Sheriffs office while they were buying products for the rest of their deputies and now just having a really focused team, we're starting to unlock a lot of that market on a much more predictable basis. And so, I think the growth there is just attributable to our team's focus as opposed to any external factors.\nErik Lapinski: Thank you.\nAndrea James: Looks like we have a follow-up from Jonathan Ho at William Blair. Thanks Jonathan.\nJonathan Ho: Yes. Just a couple for me. I wanted to maybe dig a little bit into your Microsoft opportunity. Can you talk a little bit about the level of benefit or cost savings that you could maybe see from that deal? Just as a starting point.\nRick Smith: Yes, I'd start by saying the exact terms of the deal are not something we can go public with. I don't know, Jim, what would you?\nJim Zito: Yes. I'd say, at a high level, it enables us -- it supports our target long term of having 80-plus percent software gross margins. And I think the duration of that contract is really helpful for us for having that confidence and visibility to our pricing when we set our contracts with customers. So I think it helps us over time, sort of maintain/expand our Axon Cloud gross margins. But I think the best thing of that, guys, this gives us predictability.\nJonathan Ho: Got it, got it. And then, just in terms of the commercial market, can you talk a little bit about your progress there? And maybe some of the go-to-market opportunities that you see specific to commercial? Thanks.\nJosh Isner: Yes. We're thrilled with the opportunity there. Mike Shor and his team have just done a great job building something from -- we don't get those the same advantages we sometimes have in the public sector where the referral network and stuff. We have to build those from scratch. And Mike and his team have done a great job of that. The team continues to be on a cadence of kind of doubling every year. And that\u2019s happened in terms of the results the last three years now. And we're still probably about 90% of the way there on product market fit, where we've got some really evangelical early adopters that are excited about how things are going. And now it's just kind of closing that last 10% of some of the product market fit items and really expanding each year. And I think, we're really, really well positioned to do that, and we'll start to see some names that you're very familiar with adopting our products for more commercial purposes.\nJonathan Ho: That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Great. Do we have any other follow-ups? I\u2019ll give you a second. I can see you guys thinking. Okay. All right. Let's have Rick close this out.\nRick Smith: All right. Well, obviously, another great quarter. I'm really proud of what the team was able to deliver. It's -- there's a lot going on in the world, and our team just really digs in and Josh just does a great job of keeping people focused right, lock out the noise. There's a lot happening in the world that we can affect, but there's things within our control and the more we focus, the better the results always end up being. So appreciate everybody joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on the back half. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Zito",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick and Josh. Hello, everyone. It's great to see you again. We had an excellent quarter, as you can see in our shareholder letter. Let me put some context around the results and how we are thinking about our outlook. Top line momentum continued with growth of over 30%, and gross margin improved sequentially. We delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $50 million, a margin of about 17.5% largely reflecting some expenses that were unique to this quarter. Let me unpack that for you. During the second quarter, we spent about $1 million on Axon ACCELERATE, our annual user conference, which has become strategically important to our sales pipeline, technology leadership and ecosystem expansion. Additionally, we committed more than $3 million in incremental mid-year bonuses to employees at the senior director level and below. This was an intentional decision given the team over delivering on results in an environment where inflation was impacting their lives. We did so precisely because we had line of sight to stronger-than-expected revenue, both in the quarter and in the back half of the year, which is reflected in our updated outlook. We are especially pleased that we could issue this bonus without affecting our projected adjusted EBITDA margin percentage for the year. The fundamental strength of our business allowed us to demonstrate our commitment both to our shareholders and to the team members who work so hard for our customers. With that context on the quarter, we are already focusing on moderating expense growth going forward to help drive adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Our working capital needs were $23 million in the quarter, and we have already started to see some of that reverse in July, which is driving us to maintain our full year adjusted free cash flow outlook. Finally, I'd really like to highlight our commentary in the shareholder letter about our technology partner ecosystem, which was exciting to see in action this past May at ACCELERATE. In June, we renewed our strategic technology partnership with Microsoft Azure, who will continue to be the primary host of our software platform and cloud. This is a great partnership for us in many ways. Microsoft is a global leader in cloud technology. Of course, they need no introduction. Our customers trust Microsoft and thereby feel secure putting their data into our cloud. As part of the renewal, we extended our contract term for another six years, which gives us long-term pricing certainty and cost visibility for our Axon Cloud business. The renewal supports our software gross margin target of more than 80% and also paves the way for faster international cloud expansion without diluting this target. And what's also excellent about this partnership is the ability it affords us to offer pricing predictability to our own customers. So it's just a winning deal all around. We also highlighted several of our ecosystem partners in strategic investments during our Accelerate conference and in today's letter. The investments we make are driven by our long-term product strategy, which is set under the leadership of Rick, Chief Product Officer, Jeff Kunins, and Josh. Our corporate development team led by Andrea has been a key thought partner in enabling Axon to grow into its role as the definitive technology hub for public safety. We take pride in our approach to identifying emerging market leaders in the high-value sectors that we know well, integrating their solutions with ours and combining them with the power of our direct sales channel and deep customer relationships. Importantly, the structures our corporate development team has negotiated on behalf of Axon provide us with significant flexibility and optionality on the investments we make. The ability to obtain customer feedback experiment with product integrations and see how our teams work together, allows us to preserve optionality for our business, delight our customers and expand our technology ecosystem in a highly efficient way. And with that, Andrea, let's take questions. I take the first half of that. I guess, yes, so we can disclose future contracted revenue, Erik, in the letter. So that grew to $3.3 billion. So it was up versus a little bit less than $3 billion as of the end of Q2. And then, yes, there's really no -- nothing -- in Q4, we had some unfulfilled demand that rolled into the first half of the year, but we're sort of back to more normalized levels, obviously, quarter-to-quarter order inflows. And I guess, Josh, do you want to take the supply chain, please? Yeah. I would say that's not fully dependent on the campus headquarters. We're already starting to build out that automation. I think part of what we're seeing in the first half was really pressure in terms of growing into our expanded manufacturing footprint. So we've been investing to build out the footprint and capacity to build. And I think as we grow into those build plans, I think we'll see better overhead absorption in there. And I think that's not contingent upon the new building. I think it covers CAD, RMS are the software pieces, but there's a heavy fleet portion as well. So fleet -- there was a big uptick in terms of fleet install. So all those things together lead to that PSO revenue becoming a slightly bigger portion of the cloud revenue, but that's enabling that high-margin software cloud revenue growth as well. So it's set the groundwork for future growth. But I think PSO is an important part of us controlling that customer experience and really getting sticky customers. The fact one thing I'd probably add to that too is just like overall travel costs, as like everybody is seeing, also went up sort of at the same time as we sort of dealt with that sort of pent up post pandemic demand. And I think as Rick said, we adjust to sort of how the best way to operate in the most efficient ways from a travel and hybrid perspective going forward. I think we'll thread the needle a little bit better in terms of meeting that. And I think everybody's plays are focused on that. Yes. I'd say, at a high level, it enables us -- it supports our target long term of having 80-plus percent software gross margins. And I think the duration of that contract is really helpful for us for having that confidence and visibility to our pricing when we set our contracts with customers. So I think it helps us over time, sort of maintain/expand our Axon Cloud gross margins. But I think the best thing of that, guys, this gives us predictability."

            "content": "Awesome. All right. Well, I will launch in. Andrea, and Angel, great job, as always, on the quarterly video, that's fantastic. Great way to share all the exciting stuff with our shareholders. Okay. We're executing on what is shaping up to be a really excellent year. And our confidence in our growth extends well beyond 2022. We emerged from the pandemic and civil unrest of 2020 in our strongest position ever. And now we're fortunate to be able to leverage that position and strength, while many parts of the economy are experiencing uncertainty. We're seeing broad-based strength across our product numbers, and we're really energized by the growing number of agencies that are buying nearly everything we offer and signing up for 10-year contracts, sometimes even 12 years. It's exciting to see an agency go all in with Axon. We set a vision several years ago that an agency wouldn't just say, well, we have a TASER device or maybe we have body cameras and Evidence.com, but would instead simply describe Axon as their technology partner. And that's starting to happen now. When agencies sign up for all of our software solutions, plus our body camera, dash camera, the TASER 7, the VR training, our drone solution and so on. Customers are increasingly demonstrating their confidence that we are the right technology partner for them for the next decade. We made it easy for our customers to bet on us, because our team delivers. Now on to some other hours. We expect profitability to improve in the back half of this year. We expect to drive increased leverage coming out of Q2, when we had some expenses that won't repeat, more on that coming from Jim in a moment. Also, we recently launched an internal campaign called, spend it like it's yours to climb down on some low-hanging fruits such as travel expenses and swap. In fact, we created a new position of pointing a swag czar who must approve all purchases. Being scrappy is not new to Axon. We're just taking it to another level of rigor. I was recently quoted in the Wall Street Journal as last week saying, it's good to go on a swag detox. Not every event needs a T-shirt, and we need to balance the need to travel against what we can do over Zoom, such as maybe sending one or two key representatives to be in the room and having others join online. We're continuing though to hire and invest in this environment, and we're disciplined about it.  Our bar for talent continues to move higher, where we have seen other technology companies slowdown their hiring that presents us with opportunity. And you'll see some of that in our increased headcount spending in the second quarter. Thinking back to 2008 in that downturn, we invested in creating the cloud and body camera business, while our competitors were pulling back.  The results of that decision are measured in billions of market cap. I say ages favor the adaptable and we see times like these when the work for talent pools as an opportunity to advance our mission, so will come out of far stronger and more competitive. Our commitment to generating strong cash flow and operational discipline is shared among the entire leadership team. You'll see in our shareholder letter that we've revised our expected capital expenditures this year to reflect slower pacing on our net campus investments. We're adjusting our pacing to reflect a world that is still in flux, as we determine the best and highest use of the campus, optimizing for the new world of hybrid work, as well as the best and highest uses for our capital. It's more important that we get it right than we get it fast and we are preserving optionality. Finally, I feel great about the trajectory of our C-suite. Since our last call, Josh Isner was appointed COO; and Isaiah Fields an 11-year earn veteran of Axon was promoted to our Chief Legal Officer. Also, we've made a lot of progress with our CFO search, which Josh will highlight in a little bit more detail. In the meantime, Interim CFO, Jim Zito, hasn't missed a beat.  Before turning over the call to Josh, let me take a moment to share my thoughts about Josh's leadership skills. First, Josh's promotion to COO was really a natural progression for him and for Axon. Josh has been a rockstar since the day he got here, and he exudes sheer confidence. He built the revenue stream and embodies our core value to own it. For the past 7 years, Josh has owned quarterly revenue delivery, where he's helped us establish an excellent track record. Josh is highly focused on delivering results and executing and exhibits excellent discernment. I'm thrilled with our partnership and our working dynamics. We have a rigorous and healthy back and forth, and I'm very confident in his leadership during the next phase of rapid growth. And with that, now let me turn it over to Josh Isner. Yeah. Thanks, Josh. So earlier this year, we projected an accelerating spend on the new campus. We've -- now we're basically telling you we're going to slow that down. We're pacing it out a bit. There have been a number of things. I'd say one of them is just the inflationary environment. What we've seen as we were getting ready to really move forward with more of the significant build-out on the campus, construction costs are just up pretty dramatically. And when we couple that with, we've also seen COVID resurging, I think, even more than people had expected. And we looked at the whole return to work dynamic, we've come to accept that the future is going to be hybrid work. And so we also see opportunity to really look at what is the best use of the overall land, really optimizing for collaborative events, customer centric events, of course, the land that we need and the space we need for manufacturing and warehousing and all that. But maybe shifting the balance away from the idea of people coming into the office so much and really more the hybrid work environment. And then in this environment as well, like there's a lot going on, and we just wanted to preserve some optionality of our cash. So we basically -- let's slow down a little bit, let's really recalibrate and see what the post-COVID world looks like and let took the building cost cool off a little bit, and now give us a little time to just keep tuning and refining. The world is in a pretty constant state of flux and we'd rather take our time to make sure we get it right. Yes. Let me jump in and add it as well. Like a business like any community can't sort of have all messages all resonate all at the same time. And so you go through cycles, several years ago, we had a scrappy year where -- that was an opportunity for us to lead and say, okay, this is the year we want people to really like it's very similar what we did we spend it like pictures, like old be scrappy was, hey, we want to focus in on finding ways to more efficiently get things done and where more people are being scrappy and not throwing a body at every problem.  We've had a fair number of new employees come in. And certainly, we have our standard expense controls and training, but we felt with what's happening, look, the overall market is down, inflation is up other companies are, I'd say, more aggressively cutting back their investment plans. We saw this as an opportunity to communicate with our employees say, 'Hey, spend it like it's ours, right? Like this is a moment, let's take what's going outside, everyone has things in your control where you cut back spending. And by doing that, we'll all be rewarded. The market is rewarding companies that have more financial rigor, and we can also reward you by investing and not having to pull back on our investment plans and the exciting things we want to go build. But we can't just be toned up and continue as if the macro environment hasn't shifted. So, I think this was a balanced way for us to connect with -- maybe even some of the angst our employees are feeling about the macro environment, like, hey, here's something you can do really buckle down on expenses so we can continue to invest over here because we know these are the times those investments really pay off. Our hiring has accelerated, and I think a big part of that is it's the macro environment. We don't have as many competitors. We're having more success recruiting because we're just not competing with as many other tech companies that are as aggressive right now. And so these are the times we want to lean in and accelerate our growth. So, I hope that gives a little bit of context as to how we felt we could position us with the company employees to really get them all rolling in the same direction. I think the question was about our federal buyers. Yeah. And I would add, Josh, as well that we're starting to now invest in dedicated federal R&D. So in many cases, we're seeing the Fed customers interested in premium sort of features that might require a little more investment in certain types of hardening of different devices or software to meet certain federal requirements that in some cases, can even lead to premium pricing. Thanks. Yes, I'd start by saying the exact terms of the deal are not something we can go public with. I don't know, Jim, what would you? All right. Well, obviously, another great quarter. I'm really proud of what the team was able to deliver. It's -- there's a lot going on in the world, and our team just really digs in and Josh just does a great job of keeping people focused right, lock out the noise. There's a lot happening in the world that we can affect, but there's things within our control and the more we focus, the better the results always end up being. So appreciate everybody joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on the back half. Have a great day."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Rick. I appreciate that and it's good to see everybody. In my new role, I'm humbled by the trust our team, our customers and our shareholders have placed in me. We are working hard every day to deliver on our mission and drive exciting growth in tandem with margin expansion. Here's what that looks like in terms of where I'm investing my time and focus.  First, I'm working on building a world-class team from top to bottom. as opposed to focusing on simply filling the needs of today, I'm working with our leadership team to build the team we need for the next 5 to 10 years. We will focus on a next play mindset, versatility, mental toughness and the capability to deliver outsized outcomes as the core characteristics of our team. That starts with the search for our new CFO. We have made a lot of progress in this area, and we are very excited about the candidates that we have attracted. We hope to have someone to announce shortly that I am personally thrilled about. As Rick said, I couldn't be happier about the partnership we've had with Jim. His steady leadership has allowed us to take our time with the search for a permanent CFO. He has been the consummate teammate and done whatever the team has asked. I sincerely appreciate Jim's leadership. Second, I'll be driving discipline and prioritization across the business. The one thing each of us truly controls is where we focus our attention. We have a lot of exciting opportunities to go after. And as you all know, we will unlock maximal value by focusing our efforts only in the areas where we can have the most impact and deliver the most value for our customers. That is the optimal path for shareholder value creation as well. For every opportunity we say yes to, we will say no to dozens. And when we do say yes, we will win. From there, our job is to block out the noise and execute. Third, I will be ensuring that we are aggressively pursuing our total addressable market opportunity. We value that at $52 billion, and it continues to grow as Axon unveils new products and unlocks new markets. We view our channel as one of Axon's core differentiators, and we will continue to invest into new geographies and customer segments such as commercial enterprises, federal and adjacent markets. We will also be scaling our VR, drones, records and dispatch businesses. For every single one of our product lines, our best days are ahead. That includes the TASER business, which is changing the world for the better and it's just getting started internationally. I think you're going to be very pleased with what you see unfold here over the next couple of years. And finally, the entire management team is looking forward to turning on the free cash flow spigot over the next several quarters, which opens up a lot of options for us as a company. This is totally within our control, and we are implementing a plan to optimize the level of execution in this area. We can do a lot better here. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jim. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Will, and nice to see you again. I'd say for us, we've talked about this a lot in the video. I mentioned our flywheel for us. The biggest thing we can be doing quarter-to-quarter is driving the number of officer safety plan subscriptions up. That bundles essentially all our products outside of dispatch that we sell \u2013 sorry, dispatch and fleet. And it provides optionality for customers to opt into records, but it \u2013 it provides a nice base for ARR between the license, all the software add-ons, the TASER, the virtual reality. And so for us, that's really the major focus in our state and local business is to drive as many renewals and purchases of that plan as we can. In addition to that, I think we are seeing exciting growth in some of our newer segments, one of which is federal, another is international. And then even in newer ones like justice and corrections, we're seeing an uptick. And so I'd say, all of those are combining to just provide a lot of wind in our back, as we go on here and we certainly still feel like our best days are in front of us. Yes, absolutely. So internationally, in general, to answer your first question, I don't think we're seeing any kind of macro impacts at this point in terms of adoption, interest, buying cycles and so forth. I think we've performed in the TASER segment. We are seeing national police forces by larger order quantities of TASERs than we've seen in the past, which is really exciting. Because when we're talking about a national police force, five, six, seven times the size of NYPD and they're starting their purchases and in the thousands, the high four digits into five-digit, thousands of units of orders, like it's very exciting, because we know that we're very good at kind of the land and expand type of playbook. And so, we look at these as really good indicators for the future of our TASER business, and we do -- we are working with more and more national police forces across the world. And I'd say on top of that, our execution in our Tier 1 markets, the UK, Canada and Australia has been really strong, where we continue to see more adoption of Evidence.com and body cams, but also kind of our newer features on Evidence.com like real-time streaming and transcription. And so, the next step for us internationally is going to repeat -- is going to be to repeat that same level of execution in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. And there, we've got to do a really good job of evangelizing the cloud and helping customers understand why the cloud is far, far better as a mechanism for storing and sharing digital evidence. And so, we're working through that process. We'll continue to build there. But we're really excited about all the work our International team is doing and they're really focused right now on driving the results upward. I can still -- Sure, thing. And I'd just add to that, just traditionally in the back half, revenue performed stronger than the first half. So we're -- we see plenty of demand still and certainly are going to execute against that demand. In terms of supply chain, in general, our supply chain team has been one of our top- performing teams at Axon. As you can see in other businesses, companies are getting hit hard by supply chain constraints. Our team has just done a masterful job navigating through some of those challenges. And frankly, this is one of the reasons we do keep some inventory on the shelves to get through periods like we've had over the last few quarters. And so we think at this point, things look better and better each quarter. Like we do feel that we're through the worst of it, and that will continue to be able to build the supply orders, but also start to build a little buffer there as well on our TASER and core body camera lines. Well, at this point, I don't think we're guessing. We're just executing against our plan. And I think by the end of this year, we'll certainly see some buffer in the TASER 7 and AB 3 or Axon Body 3 product lines. And from there, I think it will just be about optimizing the level of inventory we keep on the shelves. And so from an investor results perspective, I wouldn't plan on seeing any kind of abnormal activity in either product shipped or inventory backlogs. Sure thing. I'll talk briefly about the free cash flow element there. Remind me of your first question, Sami. Yes, I'll take those two, and then I'll kick it over to Rick on the campus piece as well. So in general, I think we see stronger bookings in the back half of each year, and that's really across all products. This is the end of -- sorry, Q3 is the end of the fiscal year for several major markets in the US. It's also the federal government's end of their fiscal year. So, a combination of budgets ending and having some money to spend. And then the new budget starting, if there's a line item for our products, it tends to be a pretty active part of the year. And so I'd say, the big driver of profitability is the TASER business, and we expect exciting results there. But really across the board, we do see a lot of upside in the back half of the year. And in terms of free cash flow, I'd just say, we've reiterated our guidance, because we feel like, frankly, coming from sales, this to me is not all that different than inside sales. We've got to get in touch with customers, have a process we follow, have well-trained people on the phone, get commitments, follow-up on those commitments and then just get to the point of real predictability there. And I think Jim and I are partnering together there, and we've just brought in a new AR leader, I'm personally investing time with our accounts receivable team to build a playbook here where we can really measure efficiency and productivity. But this -- again, this one is really within our control. And when we couple that like you mentioned, Sami, with a better EBITDA, both dollars and margins in the back half of the year, there's a lot of opportunity to improve free cash flow in the back half, and we're really focused on it, and that's what we're going to do. And so I'll kick it over to Rick to talk about the new campus. Hey, Keith, it looks like you're on mute. Yes, absolutely. I think, look, the last couple of years, we've hired very, very aggressively across all segments of the business. And now -- we're starting in a lot of places to grow into that size and not need to hire as aggressively. But the one major exception to that is in product. I think from our perspective, we have a lot of great ideas, and we limit those -- what we do based on where we think we have the most upside and also the size of our team and what our team can take on. And so for us, as long as there's talented engineers, product managers on the market that can help us deliver product faster and build products that we feel can really change our outcomes in public safety, we're going to keep investing there. And so I think going into next year, the mindset is going to be -- get a little leaner in terms of our hiring plans in SG&A and continue to be aggressive where we can in R&D. I think it's -- I'm not sure it's a lack of oversight. I think certainly, we've got very good controls and process in place to measure expenses. But I think at times, we've gotten just a little bit bloated in how we think about things from the number of people that attend meetings with customers like Rick mentioned, or Swag is another obvious one, where we have -- and maybe the absence of being in the office, we've used Swag as a way to kind of connect with our employees. And so I think there's just opportunities to \u2013 to get a little more efficient in those places. It's not necessarily an indictment of anyone or anything we've done in the past. It's just more like the landscape has changed a little bit. We see all this exciting revenue growth well into the future. And it's just a matter of getting leverage out of that growth where we can without impacting our employee sentiment at Axon. And I think we can read that needle very effectively. Yes, absolutely, Josh. Thanks for the question. So, I'd say it's fair to say we're caught up on the TASER shipments from Q4 last year and we've shipped those over Q1 and Q2. And because sequentially, TASER shipments go up in the back half of the year that we still feel like Q3 and Q4 will be the highlights of the year revenue-wise. And so I think that's kind of the story Q4 tends to be a little a little higher than Q3, but over the years, we've seen the inverse of that as well. But as a back half, we certainly have a lot of confidence that will outpace the first half of this year in revenue. Yes. In terms of the mix of fleet, there's still a little bit of Fleet 2, but mainly Fleet 3 and of course, a lot of body camera shipments going out. Supply chain constraints, I'd say, we have plenty of supply to deliver on our guidance in the back half of the year. Product-by-product, when we get outside of the core TASER and body camera products, there's a little bit of flux month-to-month there. But in a macro sense, we are feeling great about where we stand from an inventory perspective. Yeah. I think it's a good question, Jeremy. And as you'd expect, it varies a little bit. I can say, just like the United States, Canada, Australia and the UK were relatively early adopters of body cams. So even if a mandate were to come down at this point, I think, I don't know that, it would change the buying behavior all that much in those three markets. I think the market has decidedly already shifted to body cameras there. In other markets, we're starting to see \u2013 I position it like international governments are starting to dip their toe a little bit into the body camera world and start to understand kind of what's going to work for them and what's not. And so I think we do have a lot of opportunity there. First, with kind of small and mid-sized orders and then growth over time and so that's the \u2013 that's really where we see kind of international going in terms of body cameras. But like I mentioned, we are seeing international governments start to deploy TASERs with a lot more conviction around the globe, and we should expect to see that continue for the years to come. And is that for international, specifically? Oh, domestically. Okay. What was that, Rick? Oh, federal. Okay. Federally mirrors \u2013 our federal government is generally mirroring what our state and local customers are doing pricing-wise. Certainly, we do have some commitments to make sure that we are recognizing the federal government and the most favored nations clauses in some of those contracts. But ultimately, we do feel pretty good that those license types and sizing is similar to what we see. And far, far ahead of where our \u2013 when our state and local customers started to buy in large volumes, like the federal government has kind of skipped that phase of basic licenses and TAP and they're buying a lot more frequently at higher license types, which is exciting. Yes, a great question, Erik. I'd say we're seeing kind of department by department, a little bit of everything. I think the agencies, you mentioned that agencies already have tasers, a lot of those are up for upgrades. So it's a great time to buy our body cameras and software and bundle those \u2013 that upgraded version of the Taser in -- with that contract.  Other customers are buying software-only, our investigator package for certain customers in the federal government. And then some standalone activity as well. The 1 really in -- there's a lot of really encouraging things here, but one of them that stands out is customers are also buying across our suite of products. They're seeing use cases for live streaming. They're seeing use cases for records, they're seeing fleet 3 interest.  And so really across the board, we're seeing a lot of interest and a lot of different products from the federal government. And it's really a credit to the work Richard Coleman, our Head of Federal and his team have done, it's really kind of transformed over the last few years from kind of a steady state market into an exponentially growing one. Yes. The team is definitely growing. And for us, I think it's more of a -- it's less about the federal government giving grants or fundings or any kind of overall market effects there. I think it's more just \u2013 historically, we haven't really had a team focused on corrections as its own market. We really did a lot of correction sales through the Sheriffs office while they were buying products for the rest of their deputies and now just having a really focused team, we're starting to unlock a lot of that market on a much more predictable basis. And so, I think the growth there is just attributable to our team's focus as opposed to any external factors. Yes. We're thrilled with the opportunity there. Mike Shor and his team have just done a great job building something from -- we don't get those the same advantages we sometimes have in the public sector where the referral network and stuff. We have to build those from scratch. And Mike and his team have done a great job of that. The team continues to be on a cadence of kind of doubling every year. And that's happened in terms of the results the last three years now. And we're still probably about 90% of the way there on product market fit, where we've got some really evangelical early adopters that are excited about how things are going. And now it's just kind of closing that last 10% of some of the product market fit items and really expanding each year. And I think, we're really, really well positioned to do that, and we'll start to see some names that you're very familiar with adopting our products for more commercial purposes."

I hope you had a chance to read our Shareholder Letter that we posted to investor.axon.com. The remarks we're going to make today build upon the information in that already robust letter. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made today are pursuant to and within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today, are not guarantees of future performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are discussed in our SEC filings. And before we go to Rick, we're going to play our quarterly video. [Audio/Video Presentation]\nRick Smith : Great job on that video, Andrea and Angel. And hello, everybody. Thanks for joining us today for our quarterly conference call. As we look at what's happening in the world, never has it been more important to emphasize our values, our mission to protect life and protect truth, especially when life and truth are being egregiously clouded with wanton and reckless lethality with a real disregard for lives lost and where the truth is being distorted and disregarded by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. As the scaled leader in our category, we are digging into our mission stronger than ever. We are energized about all the great things we're doing and the way our business is scaling. One of the things we highlighted in our Shareholder Letter is our moonshot goal, which is to cut officer -- fatal officer involved shootings in the United States by 50% over the next decade. We do not have to accept killing as a de facto part of human existence, not in war, not in policing, not in our homes. We look forward to sharing more with you as this year unfolds. I can tell you, I've been sharing with our customers about this goal, brainstorming how together can we combine product design, policies and training. Just like the energy in the room when we talk with our customers about this, everyone is excited to join forces and reduce killing. Last week, in conjunction with our CFO transition announcement, we raised our full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. We're now expecting revenue to grow 25% at the midpoint. And this is on top of 27% revenue growth last year and 28% the year before that. What our growth is demonstrating is what happens when a company builds disruptive products that solve real-world problems and invest in R&D to stay in front as the innovation leader. We're seeing a lot of product successes and not just in TASER and body cameras, but in Fleet in-car cameras with automatic license plate reading and of course, with a growing suite of cloud software, duals and features. We'll be investing some of our expected revenue outperformance this year into new initiatives that will start driving revenue in 2023. One area where we're adding investment this year is international VR training. There's a broad global market for virtual reality training, and it's our fastest-growing new category in the U.S. And we want to stay in front globally by adding new languages and scenarios to accommodate international public safety customers. On a final note, we're welcoming my friend Jim Zito to the call as our interim CFO. As you may have seen this morning, there was a press release announcing Jawad's new role as President of Aira, an exciting new tech company here in Arizona. Jawad remains committed to a smooth transition of the CFO role. On behalf of the Board and the management team, I want to thank Jawad for his dedication and all the work over the last 5 years, helping Axon innovate and grow, and we wish him the best. We couldn't be more excited about Jim and our future. Jim has played a key role in building our world-class accounting and controllership organization, enhancing our internal controls over financial reporting and overseeing the implementation of stronger processes to drive operational rigor to improve Axon's financial results.  As we embark on our CFO search, I'd like to share with you my philosophy on leadership transitions. Our next CFO inherits a culture of operational rigor and a very strong bench. I'm looking for a CFO who is energized about capital allocation discipline and that can marry with that in understanding how to combine our societal value creation with shareholder value creation. Now I'd like to hand off to Luke who will take you through some of our operational highlights. Luke?\nLuke Larson: Thanks, Rick. You saw in the video we played at the start of the call that we are highly focused on attracting world-class talent, and we feel great about our ability to do so. And in the future, we expect to continue to do this with our mission-driven focus. There's lots of these world-class Axon teammates on this call today. Many are called in, and I want to give them a huge shout on and thanks for all the work that they've done to help us build a great company. Another key execution item for us has been on ensuring that our supply chain meets our ability to satisfy customer demand. The team has executed well on this front. We have a solid plan in place that has enabled us to meet goals and production has increased in several areas in the first quarter. While we are cautiously monitoring China's latest COVID shutdown, we have visibility into supply chain supporting our revenue guidance at the midpoint throughout the full year. And the issues we flagged the past 2 quarters that led to an outsized backlog are now beginning to return to more normalized levels. Also, I encourage you to check out some of our key product updates in the Shareholder Letter. Our R&D team is truly staying at the forefront of innovation in the public safety space. Axon Fleet 3 is proving to be a game changer for in-car cameras. To date, we have installed over 6,000 cameras. Fleet 3 transforms the traditional dash camera into one that can automatically scan plates across multiple lanes of traffic at closing speeds of up to 140 miles per hour, making it disruptively affordable for agencies to deploy our automatic license plate reading in their vehicle fleet. And we believe our ethical design framework to protect citizen privacy and data misuse is not only the right thing to do, it's also a huge strategic advantage. You may have also seen our momentum with record is starting to accelerate. We just had a major city launch in the Tucson region. That brings us to more than 25 agencies with nearly 11,000 sworn officers live on Axon Records, including 9 that are already using it to fully replace their legacy records management systems. We remain excited and confident in our long-term trajectory. Our short-term focus is on driving customer success, one deployment at a time. Speaking more broadly, we recognize that there is a growing sense of macroeconomic uncertainty. As we execute against our robust pipeline and look further into the future, we remain incredibly confident in Axon's long-term positioning. We have stellar teams across the organization. We are a product and category leaders. Our customer relationships are strong and unrivaled. This is all underpinned by our enduring mission to protect life while continuing to accelerate the Axon growth flywheel across devices, workflow and intelligence and always with a long-term mindset. I'm proud that over the last 5 years, we've had a real focus on scaling a great business with operational rigor and financial discipline. These are areas where Jim Zeto has been an instrumental leader. And as we build the future, we won't maintain that rigor. Now I'm super excited to turn it over to Jim for his first earnings call.\nJim Zito: Thanks, Luke. Hello, everyone. It's great to be joining you today, especially at a time when the business is demonstrating tremendous momentum. I'd like to share some of my background in the role I've played over the past nearly 5 years at Axon, building a strong culture of financial rigor and discipline that Rick spoke to. I joined the company in 2017 after previously serving as the Global Controller of GE Healthcare Digital, a nearly $2 billion global software company inside General Electric. I spent the first 8 years of my career as an auditor at PwC, seen the insides of Fortune 500 companies and how they operate at scale. These experiences prepared me to have an impact at Axon from the moment I arrived. I have helped to build out our accounting and controllership organization, enhancing our internal controls and overseeing the implementation of stronger processes to drive operating rigor to improve our financial results. I've partnered with our SVP of FP&A, Arvind Bobra, and other cross-functional leaders across every part of our company to lead the creation of the internal clubbing necessary to enable our culture of rigor and discipline to succeed. You've seen that translate to our results. We've established an impressive track record of execution at scale coupled with cost discipline and strategic capital allocation. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver accelerating growth, profitability and cash flow. I'm energized by this opportunity to support the company as Interim CFO. This is a natural transition given my role over the past 5 years. I'm honored to lead our world-class finance team, and I've already hit the ground running. To touch upon a few themes related to the quarter. In February, we added adjusted free cash flow targets to how we talk about our financial strategy, and we've started to deliver already. In Q1, our operating cash flow of $44 million supported $32 million in adjusted free cash flow. We've raised our full year revenue outlook to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting 25% annual growth at the midpoint. And our upwardly revised adjusted EBITDA outlook reflects improved bottom line expectations as well as the opportunity to invest some of our revenue outperformance into new initiatives that can start contributing revenue quickly. And with that, we look forward to taking your questions.\nA - Andrea James: Thank you, Jim and team. Can we bring everybody up into gallery view? There. And thanks analysts. I have you all in the queue. I see you putting your hands up. We will get to it. We'll take our first question from Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho : I just wanted to start out with the guidance raise and maybe try to better understand what's giving you the confidence? What is it that you're seeing in the demand environment to raise the revenue guidance so much early in the year?\nRick Smith : Yes. Thanks for the question, Jonathan. Ultimately, it's a few things. The first is we've got a really, really strong team that's doing great work around the globe across a lot of different products and a lot of different markets. And this diversified kind of revenue strategy gives us a lot of different ways to achieve our goals. Now when we combine that with bookings from last year and years prior, which is a really good forward indicator of revenue and just the strong pipeline that we've built up through this year that we see a high probability of closing, I think it just gives us a lot of confidence across the board. So certainly proud of the way the team came out of the gate in Q1, and we hope that's the low point of the year moving forward.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent. And then just in terms of some of your commentary around the supply chain, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing, how you've been able to navigate the challenges? And just given some of the uncertainty around China, what again sort of underpins your confidence that the supply chain issues now persist?\nLuke Larson: Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. I would just reiterate, we're monitoring that situation, and we also have line of sight to the guidance that we\u2019ve provided. We've been able to bring down the backlog, and we've got a diversified product portfolio. So if we do see a single issue, we can actively manage that and derisk it. One kind of key highlight, I would give our supply team a huge shout out. And that when they go out and they're talking with our suppliers, our strategic plan and mission aligns with a lot of the type of orders that they want to fulfill. So what we're hearing is that they'll prioritize Axon because of our life-saving products over other companies that might not have as critical impact in the world. And we've just got a ton of confidence in the team and the results that we've delivered in the last 6 months and the outlook for the next 12 months.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Jonathan. We'll take our next question from Sami Badri at Credit Suisse.\nSami Badri: It's also my first conference call, so I appreciate the time. My first question is you've raised adjusted EBITDA for the year, but you did not increase free cash flow. So I kind of wanted to just get a little bit of an explanation around that given profitability stepping up? And the other piece is, it sounds like you guys are working on a lot of products with a good bit of demand in this demand backdrop environment. Is there a reason why you would reinvest a lot of the incremental cash flows into even more CapEx and build out an even bigger platform to service public safety?\nJim Zito: Yes. Thanks, Sami. I can take the first one. So this is the first year we've added free cash flow guidance, and we've got a fairly wide range I think the main driver of why we didn't update the free cash flow guidance is largely the revenue out of performance is going to be spread over most of the rest of the year, and there's typically a lag between that revenue over delivery and sort of that translate into cash. So we could see some of that cash flow over delivery slip into Q1 of next year.\nSami Badri: Got it. And then just the -- okay, that explains that part. The other part I have on supply chain constraints. Is there a specific amount of maybe a charge you had to take to expedite specific components and parts to make sure that you can make your deliveries? Or generally speaking, you have been getting prioritization from your suppliers given the importance of the products that you guys are shipping out to public safety individuals?\nLuke Larson: Yes. Great question, Sami. So we actually have been paying some expedited fees to get our components in. But our business, again, is firing on all pistons where we've been able to expand some of our product gross margins that have offset those increases, and this is just an example where we feel really good about the overall mix of our business and the strength of our operations.\nRick Smith : And welcome, Sami.\nAndrea James: Okay. We'll take our next question from Eric Suppiger at JMP.\nErik Suppiger : All right. A couple of things. First off, can you expand a little bit on the question earlier about the supply chain constraints? Have you done anything differently in terms of your inventory management or your purchase commitments? Have you been able to lock-in agreements better than what you had had before?\nLuke Larson: Yes. Great question, Erik. Most companies pre-COVID had a just-in-time manufacturing methodology. And Axon really never had that methodology because our products, we have a 5-year life on the TASERs and 2.5-year life on the cameras. And so we manage more to our business where oftentimes, we would have up to quarter or 6 months of inventory based on demand and forecast and actually gave us a good buffer going into that downturn. Throughout the last 18 to 24 months, we've been proactively working with our suppliers to ensure that we can meet delivery for our customers. In some cases, we have bought up at-risk components to further that as well as looked at different supply chain strategies to make sure we can deliver for our customers.\nErik Suppiger: Okay. And then in terms of the supply constraints, are you seeing different -- are you getting better deliveries at this point compared to where you were 90 days ago? Actually, let me rephrase. You had a $50 million deferred business. How much of that fell in the quarter? And what is your confidence that falls in the first half still?\nRick Smith : Confidence is high. It falls in the first half. We did ship some of it in Q1, but we also couple that with really strong demand out of the gate as well. And so we'll continue to ship into Q2 here. And certainly, to answer your question, the outlook from suppliers is getting in terms of the commits into Q2 is getting more promising. So certainly, on track to clear the remainder of the backlog in the first half of the year while delivering another really strong revenue quarter in Q2.\nJim Zito: Yes. That Q4 it was sort of a bit of an anomaly like higher-than-normal backlog that slipped into the first half of this year, I think we'll get back to more normalized levels of backlog sort of from here going forward.\nLuke Larson: Yes. Just to add some more color to your specific question around is our service from suppliers better today than it was 90 days ago. We would see Q3 probably the middle to end of Q3 last year is a real low watermark in terms of just not being able to get commitments and having to kind of manage that hand them out. In the last 6 months, we've really worked with our suppliers to ensure we can get those commitments. And we feel just reiterating really good about the year outlook.\nErik Suppiger: Okay. Then one last quick one. Jim Zito, are you one of the candidates for the CFO position? Or what is your status?\nJim Zito: I have been heads down for the last week, focusing on executing for the quarter. And for us, it's business as usual. We close the books every 3 months. So we've got a great team focused on that. I think as the process plays out, it's a certainly very attractive position. The company is clicking on all cylinders. It's got a great mission in the world, and I'm confident that Rick and the Board and the team will consider some internal and external candidates, and it's an attractive place to be.\nRick Smith : Let me add some color there, too. Yes, Jim and I have talked about this. In any senior position like this, we want to make sure we run a really rigorous process. And so we're going to want to make sure that we get a full raft of qualified external candidates as well as internal candidates. And then this gives us an opportunity for Jim to try to roll on as well and see how he enjoys it compared to his role here as Controller. I would say, with very high confidence, there's a role for Jim on the team going forward, and it may be the CFO role. It may be returning to Controller. And we're just going to make sure that we've done a process that gets us to a level where we're really confident that we've got the right team and the right positions for the next decades.\nAndrea James: We're going to take our next question from Scott Berg at Needham.\nScott Berg: I got a couple here. I wanted to start with the cloud revenue growth in the quarter, up 47%. It's clearly seeing a lot of momentum over the last year. This is an area that's been growing in the, we'll call it, low to mid-30s for an extended period, but 47% is a nice movement upward. How should we think about the acceleration in the revenues in that business? Is it more driven by Evidence.com or the layering in of some of the customers that went live on Records or some of the VR training? My guess is it's a component of that, but I didn't know how you might break that up between those different product areas?\nRick Smith : Yes. I think ultimately, we're adding a lot of new users every quarter onto our platform. And a lot of that is within just new body camera users that were an agency might have bought not get started, but is now kind of going to full deployment. And so as we deploy more and more of those users, it certainly adds to service revenue with the same dynamic with Fleet right now. We really feel great about the trajectory of our in-car video business and certainly, that's helping as well. And then some of our kind of up-and-coming offerings like some of the software add-ons as a result of selling more and more of our officer safety plan bundle, combined with VR licenses, there's a lot of factors that are all contributing to the growing service revenue. And I think the top line though is deploying more and more devices around the world that come with those licenses.\nLuke Larson: Yes, that's right, just to add on there. And as Rick talked about earlier, we're incredibly gratified to be able to just keep building out our ecosystem and expanding on all of those vectors, right? So it's the combination of existing customers upping into our higher value bundles and plans. And it's about customers even outside of those, adding a la carte add-ons for our diverse range of new products, both premium features on top of our classic products like Evidence.com as well as new things like VR and across the board and then doubling down on that the expansion into new market segments like federal and justice and the others and global expansion into other geographies. So across all 3 of those vectors just seeing both new logos and existing ones growing their bet on the Axon ecosystem with our products.\nScott Berg: Great. Helpful. And then from a follow-up perspective, a question I've actually received multiple times recently is product penetration or how to think about penetration rates on a couple of areas? I think we all understand TASER, at least domestically with at the police workforce in the United States probably has a high penetration rate. But how to think about TASERs and body cameras on a more global basis, where you are in the penetration rates? And I feel like I was set up on this question because in a headline on my local newspaper very top right now is all Minnesota Trooper is now wearing body cameras. They're obviously Axon devices given they're tighten with TASERs. But how should we think about penetration rates, especially in the body camera side, given all the things that are happening around Justice and other areas today?\nRick Smith : Yes. I think we have a very intentional strategy there, and we've had that same strategy for some time now, which is really fortify what we would call the Tier 1 markets, the UK, Canada and Australia and try to become the market leader across both less lethal and body cameras. And I think the teams executed really well in that regard over the last few years such that we're able to expand our focus beyond that now into several other large markets around the world. And so now we're really focused on repeating that same mechanism in those markets, building up a sales force that's capable of selling both products, working with early customers and then kind of using that same land and expand approach to growing and becoming the market leader in those categories. And so I think we're doing this in a very in a very calculated way to make sure that we can really be successful in every market we enter. And I'd include the federal government in the United States as part of that as well. And we continue to scale up teams that are capable of delivering those kind of outcomes. So we feel like there's plenty of room to grow outside of the United States and in the federal government, and we'll continue to execute to fulfill that TAM as we go here.\nLuke Larson: Yes, building on that, I mean, even in our classic categories like TASER and body cameras, as we shared before, the bottom line as our penetration, is still pretty modest and there's a tremendous amount of white space to keep growing. And then as another example of where we can -- even where we have penetration of a category like body cameras, by adding on new products on top of that, it expands the overall opportuniti. So one of the fastest-growing products we have is Respond, which is our live streaming and other connected camera features on top of the body camera. And so as customers who may have already bought a body camera up into that, either through a bundle or a la carte, it's an example of just continuing to grow the category even if that overall socket has already been filled with the basic camera.\nAndrea James: Next question from Will Power at Baird.\nWilliam Power: Okay. Great. I guess a couple of questions. Maybe first, just to follow up on cloud revenue and the strength there. It felt like some notable acceleration in the Records business, up to 25 agencies using it, 9 with who was close to full replacement. So I just want to understand what's helping accelerate the adoption there? Has there been new features added? How do we think about the trend lines from here? Can you kind of -- is the expectation every couple of quarters you're going to add a few more key Records customers? What kind of keeps the momentum going there?\nRick Smith : So for those that have covered Axon for a little while now, I remember a couple of years ago, when we launched the Officer Safety Plan, that part of the strategy there was to introduce Records as part of that bundle. And now several major cities and counties and state police agencies have all adopted that plan and they have the built-in option to activate Axon Records as part of that. Now some might start with the first module of Records, which is standards, and some are going all in like Tucson on the Records product and getting deployed quickly. And so we have a very, very healthy queue of customers waiting to deploy Records now. We continue to invest in the COGS resource as necessary, meaning professional services and deployment personnel to accelerate how fast we adopt records. And I'll tell you it's a really fun feeling that we went live with Tucson. And we just kind of -- it was up and running. We moved on to the next customer after that without any real challenges as we got going, and we expect to see more and more of that in the Records product. And we're really confident in the team across product and services that's deploying this product and really, really excited about what the future holds for Records.\nWilliam Power: Great to see some success there. Maybe just switching gears, a big focus everybody force has been in Europe. I'd love to get your perspective on any kind of Ukraine-Russia exposure? I think you have a small customer in Ukraine, but I think it's pretty small. But more broadly, how are you seeing that conflict impact, sales trends, appetite for our broader suite of products kind of across the continent growth?\nRick Smith : I think in the Ukraine, we do have a small TASER business there, and we'll see what the future holds. Certainly, obviously, a very tragic demand over there over the last couple of months here. I would say, across Europe at this point, the nice thing about our products is they have applicability every day regardless of kind of the state of current affairs. And so we continue to see strong demand, both in terms of the desire for more transparency across public safety and also an alternative to the bullet. And so I really believe that we're seeing a lot of really exciting growth indicators in some major European markets. I'm sure we'll talk more about those as time goes on here. But Europe and kind of the demand in Europe continues to grow in both product lines.\nAndrea James: Okay. We'll take our next question from Keith Housum at Northcoast.\nKeith Housum: I'm not trying to get too far into the details here, but I kind of noticed like the TASER X2 and X26P. The volumes were down significantly, I guess, year-over-year. And obviously, they're very valuable. But I know you guys have plans the next generation of the TASER device as well. So perhaps could you just provide the color in terms of the plan for the TASER portfolio and where it's heading? Was it focused drawdown on the older products now or what not?\nRick Smith : Yes. I think thing is largely just a shift in demand. The TASER 7 is really sort of hit its stride. And now we do still have customers, particularly those that have really long approval time lines in international and federal spaces that might still be on some of our more legacy devices. But I'm pleased to see that I think we got it right with TASER 7, and it's really hitting the mark. And of course, our goal of next-generation systems is continue to move the ball down field towards making the bullet obsolete.\nKeith Housum: Great. And as you go with that, I know you guys go on that. Obviously, we saw the recurring payment base for the TASER Weapons dropped down to 45% from 54% last year. Was this more just international sales this quarter or perhaps further on -- or that dropped kind of the spectrum trend go upward on that one?\nRick Smith : Yes. That metric is largely dependent on the mix. So when we have kind of a number of international shipments that can bring that down. I'd say there's no change at all in terms of the momentum of service plans in the United States or in our Tier 1 markets. In fact, I believe every TASER that has been sold in the UK that is deployed right now is on a payment plan. And I think we're looking to repeat that in Canada and Australia as well. And so when we get some of these onetime large orders from markets outside of our Tier 1 markets, they're generally not on plans. Some of that's due to the risk of collectibility, if we're working with a first-time distributor or a first-time customer. So there's a lot that goes into that, but I wouldn't say there's any developments that would give us less confidence in that metric over time.\nAndrea James: Next up, Eric Lapinski, Morgan Stanley.\nErik Lapinski: Maybe if we could just talk about Fleet for a second. I know you guys talked a lot about the early traction you're seeing there. I guess I'm curious, is that mostly coming from maybe customers that weren't already on-body cameras and have had in-car cameras? Are you seeing kind of a cross of using and deploying both? I tend to think like state police maybe having gotten on-body cameras. So just wondering if the early interest in Fleet is more from that angle or it's on-body camera customers already?\nLuke Larson: Yes. We're very, very excited about Fleet in general. I think it's a great case study and how the first product kind of demonstrated the use case and then the subsequent couple of versions of the product have kind of propelled us into a place where we're among the market leaders, if not the market leader in that space. And where customers in the state police use case often are doing most of their patrolling on highways. So Fleet is a very natural product line for them to adopt. But we also -- we're seeing it across cities and counties as well as kind of a supplemental viewpoint for the body camera. So that's been nice to see. And I think one of the exciting things about Fleet long term is adoption of additional software within the Fleet offering. So ALPR, license plate recognition has become one of our fastest selling add-ons because customers are really valuing that additional capability at a far lower cost than they're used to and being able to deploy it in every car, which they're not used to historically. So certainly excited for what the future holds in Fleet and excited about the additional kind of revenue opportunities that come along with just the core system there.\nRick Smith : Yes. Let me add -- let me take this one as well. Fleet 1 and Fleet 2, there, we won deals because people are on our body cameras and they love the software. And they bought our body -- or I'm sorry, they bought our Fleet cameras largely for the first reason because they wanted them to work with their body cameras. With Fleet 3, we're going toe to toe. It is the best in-car video system in the market, full stop. We've got customers buying who've never had body cameras with us. And it's winning head-to-head against the other systems in the market, and in particular, our ALPR performance. I just really can't compliment Jeff and his team enough on the great work they did there. The imaging design of those systems have one image really optimized to be able to do 3 lanes in poor light conditions, at high speeds and still be able to get ALPR and have a second image that's really focused on getting the right level of resolution, balancing video size and video performance. So it's a pretty killer combination now that we've got I think the best body cameras and the best Fleet cameras and hands down the strongest software ecosystem. And that's why we're really seeing the demand for Fleet 3 outpaced our expectations and the attach rate on ALPR is also above expectations as well.\nLuke Larson: Okay. I can't resist one really small build on that as well. Thank you for that great information on both. I think 1 of the things that speaks to why something like ALPR built into every single vehicle at a disruptively affordable price is a game changer for the mission impact too. Because if an agency only has a few cars with an old school expensive ALPR unit, then when they are going to get a hit on something is going to be piecemeal few and far between where those vehicles happen to be any moment. But the immediacy of every vehicle, they're just driving down the road going to wherever they're going and instantly if a car, stolen car, whatever it is, just happens to pass them 3 lanes over, boom, it alerts and they can action on that immediately because they're physically present right there. And that match of having every single vehicle have that capability because it's become disruptively affordable and effective is a perfect example of technology-enabling the mission combined with the right business model for it.\nErik Lapinski: I appreciate all the info. And then just on kind of the contract cycles for Fleet or even the replacement cycles for that product versus body cameras. Can you -- is it a similar kind of typically 5-year contract and ship once or twice within that, if you could just kind of help us better understand the difference in the actual hardware cycle?\nLuke Larson: Sure thing. So for body cameras, our historically kind of normal contract length was 5 years. We're actually seeing that expand out to 10 years in some cases with some of our largest customers, which is really exciting. Now what that contemplates is the customer receives their first cameras upfront and then every 2.5 years, they receive a camera refresh. With Fleet, it's a 5-year life cycle. So they're kind of -- and that is also a good thing for agencies because reinstalling camera systems in cars is much more involved than kind of swapping out body cameras. So I wouldn't say there's much demand to accelerate that cycle. And so for body cameras, we're at 2.5 years and for Fleet, it's more like 5 years.\nRick Smith : There's one other thing I feel compelled to add. It's not just the hardware. Our real secret sauce is the mission mindset of the people. And I know that can sound clich\u00e9. But I can tell you, we had a major state control recently deployed from a competitor, they moved over to Fleet. And they asked me to come up because they wanted to award a trooper hat to their program manager who had led the installation. And in that case, I think it was Jenny. She used did a fantastic job, and you can't overstate how important that is when people are just passionate or -- Jeff and his team, I got just tremendous kudos. We had a recent big software go live where the chief called me and said, \"Hey, we feel like you guys -- we can rely on you. You're in the trenches with us. Nobody is saying it's not my job. Nobody is leaving at 5:00 o'clock. We had people there past midnight helping bring that agency live.\" That is the intangible thing you'll never see on our financial statements. There's no way to represent it there, but that is probably our greatest single competitive advantage is the passionate people that we have rallied around our mission.\nAndrea James: Right. And last, but certainly not least, Paul Chung at JPMorgan.\nPaul Chung: All right. So just on the commercial sector, can you kind of expand on the momentum that you're seeing across verticals. You mentioned some key wins there. Where are you seeing some of that momentum? And how is that market evolving? And how material can this be over time? I have a follow up.\nRick Smith : Let me make an intro and then I'll hand to Josh to give some more detail. I think what we're seeing is we've solved a very difficult use case, which is these supercritical interactions between police and the public that handle it that happen in very difficult environments sort of out in the wild and there's 0 room for failure. And then this videos that come off this, this is stuff that has to be protected to meet the federal rules of Evidence and state rules of Evidence. So the level of security and reliability we've built in to handle this very difficult and demanding consumer area, really starting to port nicely into other, let's say, less mission-critical areas. But as you can imagine, the ability to record every enterprise on earth, probably some variable where they are recording interactions, incidents, whether it's a delivery person delivery something or a paramedic interacting with a patient on down the line. And in all of these business use cases, most of that documentation happens today with people filling out forms with pen and paper or typing it on a computer. And we believe the sort of video business record that we've created in law enforcement can now begin to port to these other areas where there's great efficiency gains. And ultimately, you're getting a more fulsome record of what actually happened by reporting that human interaction. And because we're building the tools to extract transcripts and be able to get smarter about how to extract metadata and alerts and things from these cameras to be able to then populate that into more structured data forms, I think just creates virtually -- I don't want to get too excited here, but almost any enterprise could have a need to use this type of way to document what's happening in their interactions, whatever they may be. With that, let me hand over to Josh to get maybe a little more specific.\nLuke Larson: Yes. I agree with everything Rick said and our small kind of scrappy team working on this by Mike doing a really good job kind of finding our early customers. And just like in the public safety space, getting those early customers happily deployed, leads to kind of more and more opportunity, and we're in that phase now. And we've already signed contracts with some really big names that are household names in terms of other vendors in the commercial space that are deploying our products and we really believe this is a big part of our future. I think we're, at this point, not making many product investments and seeing kind of still these companies adopt body cameras and the Evidence management software. And I think going into kind of our next round of planning, we will make some more investments to make this even more attractive to future customers outside of public safety, and we're really excited about where that road leads.\nPaul Chung: Yes. I know you started with Arizona Diamondbacks, but can you -- you kind of work that's kind of in your hometown, but can you work on a league level expand across the whole country, the different sport leagues? And is that kind of your sales strategy as well?\nLuke Larson: We can, and we will, but that still represents a pretty small TAM in the grand scheme of things. I think we're focused on deploying with like Fortune 500 companies that see a need for this, whether it's last mile delivery services or retail or other risk management opportunities. Whether it's in hospitality, there are some really kind of clear use cases where we're getting a lot of positive feedback on the use of cameras, and I think we're seeing it at kind of a macro level as well. And in UK, there was some coverage about the deployment of body cameras in retail, and we're seeing that same thing in the U.S. So we're excited about where this will lead.\nPaul Chung: And lastly, the consumer segment. So what's been the reception of the StrikeLight? Is it kind of tracking your expectations? Are you seeing some momentum in consumer? Or will that kind of take some time for adoption there?\nLuke Larson: I can touch on that a little. We saw -- just given some of the focus around our core business, we were really ramping up to deliver that. Our consumer business is still a relatively small part of our business. I would say the demand for the StrikeLight 2 has been high. And I think I might be the highest purchaser. I was giving it to a lot of friends and family and hearing good response from them. But I think it's a little too early to tell.\nRick Smith : Yes. I would say we're proud of those products. They are nice refreshes that will -- but they're not going to lead to explosive exponential growth. They're leading to continued nice growth in the consumer segment. As we look to next-generation sort of TASER technology, I think that's where we might start to see things that break out of the kind of historical demand curves that we've been in. So stay tuned. I think you'll see innovations come to our core market first as we look to obsolete the bullet. And then from there, we'll leverage some of the newer stuff that I think could really begin to expand consumer adoption.\nAndrea James: Thank you. And Jeremy Hamblin from Craig Hallum has joined the call. No, no? Okay, good. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. Okay. Is there anyone who has a follow-up, do you want to put a hand up? Give you a second here. \nAndrea James: Okay. We don't have anyone else in the queue. Thank you so much for joining us. Rick is going to close this out.\nRick Smith : Awesome. Well, hey, we know it's been a rough environment out there for all of our investors. As I tell my team, we try not to focus to at all really on things that are outside of our control. I'm really proud of the results the team has continued to turn in despite all the challenges the world has thrown at us. And we see, obviously, for us to raise guidance in this environment, took a fair amount of confidence for us to look across the business and have the confidence to come forth and share an increasing outlook when most of the world is pulling back. So I couldn't be prouder of the team, more thankful of our investors, and we're excited for the future. So we look forward to seeing some of you at ACCELERATE later this month and back on our earnings call a few months from now and the Shareholder Meeting, of course. We've got some busy times coming up. So thanks, everybody, and thanks again to our fantastic team for just continuing to deliver.",

            "content": "Thanks, Luke. Hello, everyone. It's great to be joining you today, especially at a time when the business is demonstrating tremendous momentum. I'd like to share some of my background in the role I've played over the past nearly 5 years at Axon, building a strong culture of financial rigor and discipline that Rick spoke to. I joined the company in 2017 after previously serving as the Global Controller of GE Healthcare Digital, a nearly $2 billion global software company inside General Electric. I spent the first 8 years of my career as an auditor at PwC, seen the insides of Fortune 500 companies and how they operate at scale. These experiences prepared me to have an impact at Axon from the moment I arrived. I have helped to build out our accounting and controllership organization, enhancing our internal controls and overseeing the implementation of stronger processes to drive operating rigor to improve our financial results. I've partnered with our SVP of FP&A, Arvind Bobra, and other cross-functional leaders across every part of our company to lead the creation of the internal clubbing necessary to enable our culture of rigor and discipline to succeed. You've seen that translate to our results. We've established an impressive track record of execution at scale coupled with cost discipline and strategic capital allocation. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver accelerating growth, profitability and cash flow. I'm energized by this opportunity to support the company as Interim CFO. This is a natural transition given my role over the past 5 years. I'm honored to lead our world-class finance team, and I've already hit the ground running. To touch upon a few themes related to the quarter. In February, we added adjusted free cash flow targets to how we talk about our financial strategy, and we've started to deliver already. In Q1, our operating cash flow of $44 million supported $32 million in adjusted free cash flow. We've raised our full year revenue outlook to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting 25% annual growth at the midpoint. And our upwardly revised adjusted EBITDA outlook reflects improved bottom line expectations as well as the opportunity to invest some of our revenue outperformance into new initiatives that can start contributing revenue quickly. And with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Yes. Thanks, Sami. I can take the first one. So this is the first year we've added free cash flow guidance, and we've got a fairly wide range I think the main driver of why we didn't update the free cash flow guidance is largely the revenue out of performance is going to be spread over most of the rest of the year, and there's typically a lag between that revenue over delivery and sort of that translate into cash. So we could see some of that cash flow over delivery slip into Q1 of next year. Yes. That Q4 it was sort of a bit of an anomaly like higher-than-normal backlog that slipped into the first half of this year, I think we'll get back to more normalized levels of backlog sort of from here going forward. I have been heads down for the last week, focusing on executing for the quarter. And for us, it's business as usual. We close the books every 3 months. So we've got a great team focused on that. I think as the process plays out, it's a certainly very attractive position. The company is clicking on all cylinders. It's got a great mission in the world, and I'm confident that Rick and the Board and the team will consider some internal and external candidates, and it's an attractive place to be."

            "name": "Luke Larson",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. You saw in the video we played at the start of the call that we are highly focused on attracting world-class talent, and we feel great about our ability to do so. And in the future, we expect to continue to do this with our mission-driven focus. There's lots of these world-class Axon teammates on this call today. Many are called in, and I want to give them a huge shout on and thanks for all the work that they've done to help us build a great company. Another key execution item for us has been on ensuring that our supply chain meets our ability to satisfy customer demand. The team has executed well on this front. We have a solid plan in place that has enabled us to meet goals and production has increased in several areas in the first quarter. While we are cautiously monitoring China's latest COVID shutdown, we have visibility into supply chain supporting our revenue guidance at the midpoint throughout the full year. And the issues we flagged the past 2 quarters that led to an outsized backlog are now beginning to return to more normalized levels. Also, I encourage you to check out some of our key product updates in the Shareholder Letter. Our R&D team is truly staying at the forefront of innovation in the public safety space. Axon Fleet 3 is proving to be a game changer for in-car cameras. To date, we have installed over 6,000 cameras. Fleet 3 transforms the traditional dash camera into one that can automatically scan plates across multiple lanes of traffic at closing speeds of up to 140 miles per hour, making it disruptively affordable for agencies to deploy our automatic license plate reading in their vehicle fleet. And we believe our ethical design framework to protect citizen privacy and data misuse is not only the right thing to do, it's also a huge strategic advantage. You may have also seen our momentum with record is starting to accelerate. We just had a major city launch in the Tucson region. That brings us to more than 25 agencies with nearly 11,000 sworn officers live on Axon Records, including 9 that are already using it to fully replace their legacy records management systems. We remain excited and confident in our long-term trajectory. Our short-term focus is on driving customer success, one deployment at a time. Speaking more broadly, we recognize that there is a growing sense of macroeconomic uncertainty. As we execute against our robust pipeline and look further into the future, we remain incredibly confident in Axon's long-term positioning. We have stellar teams across the organization. We are a product and category leaders. Our customer relationships are strong and unrivaled. This is all underpinned by our enduring mission to protect life while continuing to accelerate the Axon growth flywheel across devices, workflow and intelligence and always with a long-term mindset. I'm proud that over the last 5 years, we've had a real focus on scaling a great business with operational rigor and financial discipline. These are areas where Jim Zeto has been an instrumental leader. And as we build the future, we won't maintain that rigor. Now I'm super excited to turn it over to Jim for his first earnings call. Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. I would just reiterate, we're monitoring that situation, and we also have line of sight to the guidance that we've provided. We've been able to bring down the backlog, and we've got a diversified product portfolio. So if we do see a single issue, we can actively manage that and derisk it. One kind of key highlight, I would give our supply team a huge shout out. And that when they go out and they're talking with our suppliers, our strategic plan and mission aligns with a lot of the type of orders that they want to fulfill. So what we're hearing is that they'll prioritize Axon because of our life-saving products over other companies that might not have as critical impact in the world. And we've just got a ton of confidence in the team and the results that we've delivered in the last 6 months and the outlook for the next 12 months. Yes. Great question, Sami. So we actually have been paying some expedited fees to get our components in. But our business, again, is firing on all pistons where we've been able to expand some of our product gross margins that have offset those increases, and this is just an example where we feel really good about the overall mix of our business and the strength of our operations. Yes. Great question, Erik. Most companies pre-COVID had a just-in-time manufacturing methodology. And Axon really never had that methodology because our products, we have a 5-year life on the TASERs and 2.5-year life on the cameras. And so we manage more to our business where oftentimes, we would have up to quarter or 6 months of inventory based on demand and forecast and actually gave us a good buffer going into that downturn. Throughout the last 18 to 24 months, we've been proactively working with our suppliers to ensure that we can meet delivery for our customers. In some cases, we have bought up at-risk components to further that as well as looked at different supply chain strategies to make sure we can deliver for our customers. Yes. Just to add some more color to your specific question around is our service from suppliers better today than it was 90 days ago. We would see Q3 probably the middle to end of Q3 last year is a real low watermark in terms of just not being able to get commitments and having to kind of manage that hand them out. In the last 6 months, we've really worked with our suppliers to ensure we can get those commitments. And we feel just reiterating really good about the year outlook. Yes, that's right, just to add on there. And as Rick talked about earlier, we're incredibly gratified to be able to just keep building out our ecosystem and expanding on all of those vectors, right? So it's the combination of existing customers upping into our higher value bundles and plans. And it's about customers even outside of those, adding a la carte add-ons for our diverse range of new products, both premium features on top of our classic products like Evidence.com as well as new things like VR and across the board and then doubling down on that the expansion into new market segments like federal and justice and the others and global expansion into other geographies. So across all 3 of those vectors just seeing both new logos and existing ones growing their bet on the Axon ecosystem with our products. Yes, building on that, I mean, even in our classic categories like TASER and body cameras, as we shared before, the bottom line as our penetration, is still pretty modest and there's a tremendous amount of white space to keep growing. And then as another example of where we can -- even where we have penetration of a category like body cameras, by adding on new products on top of that, it expands the overall opportuniti. So one of the fastest-growing products we have is Respond, which is our live streaming and other connected camera features on top of the body camera. And so as customers who may have already bought a body camera up into that, either through a bundle or a la carte, it's an example of just continuing to grow the category even if that overall socket has already been filled with the basic camera. Yes. We're very, very excited about Fleet in general. I think it's a great case study and how the first product kind of demonstrated the use case and then the subsequent couple of versions of the product have kind of propelled us into a place where we're among the market leaders, if not the market leader in that space. And where customers in the state police use case often are doing most of their patrolling on highways. So Fleet is a very natural product line for them to adopt. But we also -- we're seeing it across cities and counties as well as kind of a supplemental viewpoint for the body camera. So that's been nice to see. And I think one of the exciting things about Fleet long term is adoption of additional software within the Fleet offering. So ALPR, license plate recognition has become one of our fastest selling add-ons because customers are really valuing that additional capability at a far lower cost than they're used to and being able to deploy it in every car, which they're not used to historically. So certainly excited for what the future holds in Fleet and excited about the additional kind of revenue opportunities that come along with just the core system there. Okay. I can't resist one really small build on that as well. Thank you for that great information on both. I think 1 of the things that speaks to why something like ALPR built into every single vehicle at a disruptively affordable price is a game changer for the mission impact too. Because if an agency only has a few cars with an old school expensive ALPR unit, then when they are going to get a hit on something is going to be piecemeal few and far between where those vehicles happen to be any moment. But the immediacy of every vehicle, they're just driving down the road going to wherever they're going and instantly if a car, stolen car, whatever it is, just happens to pass them 3 lanes over, boom, it alerts and they can action on that immediately because they're physically present right there. And that match of having every single vehicle have that capability because it's become disruptively affordable and effective is a perfect example of technology-enabling the mission combined with the right business model for it. Sure thing. So for body cameras, our historically kind of normal contract length was 5 years. We're actually seeing that expand out to 10 years in some cases with some of our largest customers, which is really exciting. Now what that contemplates is the customer receives their first cameras upfront and then every 2.5 years, they receive a camera refresh. With Fleet, it's a 5-year life cycle. So they're kind of -- and that is also a good thing for agencies because reinstalling camera systems in cars is much more involved than kind of swapping out body cameras. So I wouldn't say there's much demand to accelerate that cycle. And so for body cameras, we're at 2.5 years and for Fleet, it's more like 5 years. Yes. I agree with everything Rick said and our small kind of scrappy team working on this by Mike doing a really good job kind of finding our early customers. And just like in the public safety space, getting those early customers happily deployed, leads to kind of more and more opportunity, and we're in that phase now. And we've already signed contracts with some really big names that are household names in terms of other vendors in the commercial space that are deploying our products and we really believe this is a big part of our future. I think we're, at this point, not making many product investments and seeing kind of still these companies adopt body cameras and the Evidence management software. And I think going into kind of our next round of planning, we will make some more investments to make this even more attractive to future customers outside of public safety, and we're really excited about where that road leads. We can, and we will, but that still represents a pretty small TAM in the grand scheme of things. I think we're focused on deploying with like Fortune 500 companies that see a need for this, whether it's last mile delivery services or retail or other risk management opportunities. Whether it's in hospitality, there are some really kind of clear use cases where we're getting a lot of positive feedback on the use of cameras, and I think we're seeing it at kind of a macro level as well. And in UK, there was some coverage about the deployment of body cameras in retail, and we're seeing that same thing in the U.S. So we're excited about where this will lead. I can touch on that a little. We saw -- just given some of the focus around our core business, we were really ramping up to deliver that. Our consumer business is still a relatively small part of our business. I would say the demand for the StrikeLight 2 has been high. And I think I might be the highest purchaser. I was giving it to a lot of friends and family and hearing good response from them. But I think it's a little too early to tell."

            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "Great job on that video, Andrea and Angel. And hello, everybody. Thanks for joining us today for our quarterly conference call. As we look at what's happening in the world, never has it been more important to emphasize our values, our mission to protect life and protect truth, especially when life and truth are being egregiously clouded with wanton and reckless lethality with a real disregard for lives lost and where the truth is being distorted and disregarded by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. As the scaled leader in our category, we are digging into our mission stronger than ever. We are energized about all the great things we're doing and the way our business is scaling. One of the things we highlighted in our Shareholder Letter is our moonshot goal, which is to cut officer -- fatal officer involved shootings in the United States by 50% over the next decade. We do not have to accept killing as a de facto part of human existence, not in war, not in policing, not in our homes. We look forward to sharing more with you as this year unfolds. I can tell you, I've been sharing with our customers about this goal, brainstorming how together can we combine product design, policies and training. Just like the energy in the room when we talk with our customers about this, everyone is excited to join forces and reduce killing. Last week, in conjunction with our CFO transition announcement, we raised our full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. We're now expecting revenue to grow 25% at the midpoint. And this is on top of 27% revenue growth last year and 28% the year before that. What our growth is demonstrating is what happens when a company builds disruptive products that solve real-world problems and invest in R&D to stay in front as the innovation leader. We're seeing a lot of product successes and not just in TASER and body cameras, but in Fleet in-car cameras with automatic license plate reading and of course, with a growing suite of cloud software, duals and features. We'll be investing some of our expected revenue outperformance this year into new initiatives that will start driving revenue in 2023. One area where we're adding investment this year is international VR training. There's a broad global market for virtual reality training, and it's our fastest-growing new category in the U.S. And we want to stay in front globally by adding new languages and scenarios to accommodate international public safety customers. On a final note, we're welcoming my friend Jim Zito to the call as our interim CFO. As you may have seen this morning, there was a press release announcing Jawad's new role as President of Aira, an exciting new tech company here in Arizona. Jawad remains committed to a smooth transition of the CFO role. On behalf of the Board and the management team, I want to thank Jawad for his dedication and all the work over the last 5 years, helping Axon innovate and grow, and we wish him the best. We couldn't be more excited about Jim and our future. Jim has played a key role in building our world-class accounting and controllership organization, enhancing our internal controls over financial reporting and overseeing the implementation of stronger processes to drive operational rigor to improve Axon's financial results.  As we embark on our CFO search, I'd like to share with you my philosophy on leadership transitions. Our next CFO inherits a culture of operational rigor and a very strong bench. I'm looking for a CFO who is energized about capital allocation discipline and that can marry with that in understanding how to combine our societal value creation with shareholder value creation. Now I'd like to hand off to Luke who will take you through some of our operational highlights. Luke? Yes. Thanks for the question, Jonathan. Ultimately, it's a few things. The first is we've got a really, really strong team that's doing great work around the globe across a lot of different products and a lot of different markets. And this diversified kind of revenue strategy gives us a lot of different ways to achieve our goals. Now when we combine that with bookings from last year and years prior, which is a really good forward indicator of revenue and just the strong pipeline that we've built up through this year that we see a high probability of closing, I think it just gives us a lot of confidence across the board. So certainly proud of the way the team came out of the gate in Q1, and we hope that's the low point of the year moving forward. And welcome, Sami. Confidence is high. It falls in the first half. We did ship some of it in Q1, but we also couple that with really strong demand out of the gate as well. And so we'll continue to ship into Q2 here. And certainly, to answer your question, the outlook from suppliers is getting in terms of the commits into Q2 is getting more promising. So certainly, on track to clear the remainder of the backlog in the first half of the year while delivering another really strong revenue quarter in Q2. Let me add some color there, too. Yes, Jim and I have talked about this. In any senior position like this, we want to make sure we run a really rigorous process. And so we're going to want to make sure that we get a full raft of qualified external candidates as well as internal candidates. And then this gives us an opportunity for Jim to try to roll on as well and see how he enjoys it compared to his role here as Controller. I would say, with very high confidence, there's a role for Jim on the team going forward, and it may be the CFO role. It may be returning to Controller. And we're just going to make sure that we've done a process that gets us to a level where we're really confident that we've got the right team and the right positions for the next decades. Yes. I think ultimately, we're adding a lot of new users every quarter onto our platform. And a lot of that is within just new body camera users that were an agency might have bought not get started, but is now kind of going to full deployment. And so as we deploy more and more of those users, it certainly adds to service revenue with the same dynamic with Fleet right now. We really feel great about the trajectory of our in-car video business and certainly, that's helping as well. And then some of our kind of up-and-coming offerings like some of the software add-ons as a result of selling more and more of our officer safety plan bundle, combined with VR licenses, there's a lot of factors that are all contributing to the growing service revenue. And I think the top line though is deploying more and more devices around the world that come with those licenses. Yes. I think we have a very intentional strategy there, and we've had that same strategy for some time now, which is really fortify what we would call the Tier 1 markets, the UK, Canada and Australia and try to become the market leader across both less lethal and body cameras. And I think the teams executed really well in that regard over the last few years such that we're able to expand our focus beyond that now into several other large markets around the world. And so now we're really focused on repeating that same mechanism in those markets, building up a sales force that's capable of selling both products, working with early customers and then kind of using that same land and expand approach to growing and becoming the market leader in those categories. And so I think we're doing this in a very in a very calculated way to make sure that we can really be successful in every market we enter. And I'd include the federal government in the United States as part of that as well. And we continue to scale up teams that are capable of delivering those kind of outcomes. So we feel like there's plenty of room to grow outside of the United States and in the federal government, and we'll continue to execute to fulfill that TAM as we go here. So for those that have covered Axon for a little while now, I remember a couple of years ago, when we launched the Officer Safety Plan, that part of the strategy there was to introduce Records as part of that bundle. And now several major cities and counties and state police agencies have all adopted that plan and they have the built-in option to activate Axon Records as part of that. Now some might start with the first module of Records, which is standards, and some are going all in like Tucson on the Records product and getting deployed quickly. And so we have a very, very healthy queue of customers waiting to deploy Records now. We continue to invest in the COGS resource as necessary, meaning professional services and deployment personnel to accelerate how fast we adopt records. And I'll tell you it's a really fun feeling that we went live with Tucson. And we just kind of -- it was up and running. We moved on to the next customer after that without any real challenges as we got going, and we expect to see more and more of that in the Records product. And we're really confident in the team across product and services that's deploying this product and really, really excited about what the future holds for Records. I think in the Ukraine, we do have a small TASER business there, and we'll see what the future holds. Certainly, obviously, a very tragic demand over there over the last couple of months here. I would say, across Europe at this point, the nice thing about our products is they have applicability every day regardless of kind of the state of current affairs. And so we continue to see strong demand, both in terms of the desire for more transparency across public safety and also an alternative to the bullet. And so I really believe that we're seeing a lot of really exciting growth indicators in some major European markets. I'm sure we'll talk more about those as time goes on here. But Europe and kind of the demand in Europe continues to grow in both product lines. Yes. I think thing is largely just a shift in demand. The TASER 7 is really sort of hit its stride. And now we do still have customers, particularly those that have really long approval time lines in international and federal spaces that might still be on some of our more legacy devices. But I'm pleased to see that I think we got it right with TASER 7, and it's really hitting the mark. And of course, our goal of next-generation systems is continue to move the ball down field towards making the bullet obsolete. Yes. That metric is largely dependent on the mix. So when we have kind of a number of international shipments that can bring that down. I'd say there's no change at all in terms of the momentum of service plans in the United States or in our Tier 1 markets. In fact, I believe every TASER that has been sold in the UK that is deployed right now is on a payment plan. And I think we're looking to repeat that in Canada and Australia as well. And so when we get some of these onetime large orders from markets outside of our Tier 1 markets, they're generally not on plans. Some of that's due to the risk of collectibility, if we're working with a first-time distributor or a first-time customer. So there's a lot that goes into that, but I wouldn't say there's any developments that would give us less confidence in that metric over time. Yes. Let me add -- let me take this one as well. Fleet 1 and Fleet 2, there, we won deals because people are on our body cameras and they love the software. And they bought our body -- or I'm sorry, they bought our Fleet cameras largely for the first reason because they wanted them to work with their body cameras. With Fleet 3, we're going toe to toe. It is the best in-car video system in the market, full stop. We've got customers buying who've never had body cameras with us. And it's winning head-to-head against the other systems in the market, and in particular, our ALPR performance. I just really can't compliment Jeff and his team enough on the great work they did there. The imaging design of those systems have one image really optimized to be able to do 3 lanes in poor light conditions, at high speeds and still be able to get ALPR and have a second image that's really focused on getting the right level of resolution, balancing video size and video performance. So it's a pretty killer combination now that we've got I think the best body cameras and the best Fleet cameras and hands down the strongest software ecosystem. And that's why we're really seeing the demand for Fleet 3 outpaced our expectations and the attach rate on ALPR is also above expectations as well. There's one other thing I feel compelled to add. It's not just the hardware. Our real secret sauce is the mission mindset of the people. And I know that can sound cliche\u0301. But I can tell you, we had a major state control recently deployed from a competitor, they moved over to Fleet. And they asked me to come up because they wanted to award a trooper hat to their program manager who had led the installation. And in that case, I think it was Jenny. She used did a fantastic job, and you can't overstate how important that is when people are just passionate or -- Jeff and his team, I got just tremendous kudos. We had a recent big software go live where the chief called me and said, \"Hey, we feel like you guys -- we can rely on you. You're in the trenches with us. Nobody is saying it's not my job. Nobody is leaving at 5:00 o'clock. We had people there past midnight helping bring that agency live.\" That is the intangible thing you'll never see on our financial statements. There's no way to represent it there, but that is probably our greatest single competitive advantage is the passionate people that we have rallied around our mission. Let me make an intro and then I'll hand to Josh to give some more detail. I think what we're seeing is we've solved a very difficult use case, which is these supercritical interactions between police and the public that handle it that happen in very difficult environments sort of out in the wild and there's 0 room for failure. And then this videos that come off this, this is stuff that has to be protected to meet the federal rules of Evidence and state rules of Evidence. So the level of security and reliability we've built in to handle this very difficult and demanding consumer area, really starting to port nicely into other, let's say, less mission-critical areas. But as you can imagine, the ability to record every enterprise on earth, probably some variable where they are recording interactions, incidents, whether it's a delivery person delivery something or a paramedic interacting with a patient on down the line. And in all of these business use cases, most of that documentation happens today with people filling out forms with pen and paper or typing it on a computer. And we believe the sort of video business record that we've created in law enforcement can now begin to port to these other areas where there's great efficiency gains. And ultimately, you're getting a more fulsome record of what actually happened by reporting that human interaction. And because we're building the tools to extract transcripts and be able to get smarter about how to extract metadata and alerts and things from these cameras to be able to then populate that into more structured data forms, I think just creates virtually -- I don't want to get too excited here, but almost any enterprise could have a need to use this type of way to document what's happening in their interactions, whatever they may be. With that, let me hand over to Josh to get maybe a little more specific. Yes. I would say we're proud of those products. They are nice refreshes that will -- but they're not going to lead to explosive exponential growth. They're leading to continued nice growth in the consumer segment. As we look to next-generation sort of TASER technology, I think that's where we might start to see things that break out of the kind of historical demand curves that we've been in. So stay tuned. I think you'll see innovations come to our core market first as we look to obsolete the bullet. And then from there, we'll leverage some of the newer stuff that I think could really begin to expand consumer adoption. Awesome. Well, hey, we know it's been a rough environment out there for all of our investors. As I tell my team, we try not to focus to at all really on things that are outside of our control. I'm really proud of the results the team has continued to turn in despite all the challenges the world has thrown at us. And we see, obviously, for us to raise guidance in this environment, took a fair amount of confidence for us to look across the business and have the confidence to come forth and share an increasing outlook when most of the world is pulling back. So I couldn't be prouder of the team, more thankful of our investors, and we're excited for the future. So we look forward to seeing some of you at ACCELERATE later this month and back on our earnings call a few months from now and the Shareholder Meeting, of course. We've got some busy times coming up. So thanks, everybody, and thanks again to our fantastic team for just continuing to deliver."

All right, every quarter we play a video to kick off our call. We love how this helps you get a closer view and feel for our business. To start us off today, we're going to play a video we put together that hits on a bit of what we talk about when we tell you about our moonshot. It's a little under three minutes. Let's pull up the video. [Video Presentation]\nRick Smith: All right. Thank you, Erik, and thanks all of you for joining us today. Welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings. It's great to come back to you with another incredible year in the books for Axon. We kick off these calls with those videos to help you understand what we do. Sometimes seeing these kinds of scenes brings out different emotions. But that's what our customers face every day. And making those complex situations safer for everyone involved is what energizes us in our work. I've talked about my abhorrence for violence many times in the past. [Technical Difficulty] everyone who chooses to come to work here. We envision a world where violence is just far out thought, but we are constantly trying to find new forms of technology to make this a reality, and we're really proud of the progress we've made over the last year. First, with seemingly small things like adding a warning sound to TASER 10 to help communicate to someone on the other end that something unpleasant is impending with the hopes that that person will rethink their decisions and alleviate the need for a use of force action at all. And adding a watch me button to our body camera so that an officer can proactively request a second set of eyes for them during their most high risk situations. Next, we thought a bit more outside the box, introducing individually targeted probes, enabling far more effective range on TASER 10 and making our innovative TASER technology more effective in more situations. And we reimagined real-time operations, introducing two modern communication capabilities with two-way voice communication through our body cameras to help complex decision trees in real time. As we look ahead, we're solving for higher level challenges like enabling better decision making in potentially life threatening encounters, or effectively expanding a police force by reducing the extensive time that they spend on paperwork. And we envision accelerating the speed of the entire justice system. We're innovating in diverse areas from robotic security to Generative AI to virtual reality. And there's really so much more that's still left for us to do. When I think back to the video we just showed you, think about what would happen in those situations if an officer didn't have one of our TASER devices or was not wearing one of our body cameras so we could all understand what unfolded and why. It excites me that we made huge strides and that our technology is driving better outcomes. I think a lot of what we're working on now has the opportunity to become so pervasive in the future, it will be hard for us to remember life without it. Highly disruptive technology, that's the beauty of it. When you get it right, it quickly becomes difficult to imagine what things were like beforehand. But we're not always going to get it right by ourselves. We rely heavily on feedback from our customers, their challenges in the long term, rather than what's simply in demand today. While present needs do matter too, I spend most of my time with our customers on the vision beyond tomorrow, which is what I believe will drive our growth for not just the next one to five years, but the next decades. What energizes me in my time with customers is they provide us with the best and most actionable feedback on our roadmap, the snags and problems we may run into, and they help us think through the way to overcome those challenges and the best avenues for us to deliver them what they need. Most critical for us is making sure we have the right people to help us deliver for our customers. When I look at our team, I know we have attracted some of the best and brightest to come and work here. If it's not me meeting with a customer about a new product we have in development, it's somebody from our team. Our team works together, relays feedback and understands our common goal. We don't accomplish what we're doing in silos. We join forces across the company and together with our customers. This goes beyond our current team, extends into key partners like Fusus, who we're thrilled is now part of Axon. Our partnership with Fusus began a few years ago and we've really been impressed with their people and the product they've built. I'm traveling with their founder as we speak today. Together, we're taking our real-time operations to the next level and opening our ecosystem to an even larger network of sensors and devices which will unlock entirely new solutions for our customers over time. Before I hand it over, I'd like to say that I'm grateful that I've been trusted to lead this company for the past 30 years and that we've been able to maintain same drive and energy we had when we started. I might be a little atypical as a CEO as my day-to-day responsibilities align more with my background as a Founder than as a Senior Manager. I'm focusing on what's next. What's always important in driving any enterprise from a startup to a $20 billion public company is that we need to encourage people to be the best versions of themselves, but also to challenge each other, just as our customers will challenge us, and to share in a common mission with a culture that encourages us to do our best work. I'd like to provide one last comment on something near and dear to me. We've talked about our intent to invest in our new headquarters over the past few years. And we mentioned last quarter, we were revisiting those plans after we had paused work in September -- I'm sorry, in the summer of \u201822. Part of revisiting that has been working to bring our vision of a corporate campus to life. We would like Axon to remain headquartered in Scottsdale where we own a piece of land and where we have built this business. I love Scottsdale. However, it's not clear that Scottsdale wants Axon as we're seeing the political environment become more challenging and frankly, anti-development. It's unclear if we will get the approvals we need to execute our project. So we're exploring several geographies and other options. As a result, and it may take some time before we have a definitive decision on our next steps. We will keep you updated in the coming quarters as we resolve our plans and we make progress. Now, I know we're not a startup anymore, and that also means we need people focused on execution, making sure that what we do is viable and is executed to world-class standards. And I am beyond fortunate that Josh and Brittany and their teams here to help me in our execution. And with that, I'll turn it over to them now. You're up first, Josh.\nJosh Isner: Thanks a lot, Rick. And good afternoon to everybody. I continue to believe there is no better place to be than at Axon. We are building the most talented, outcomes-oriented team in tech, knowing that that's what it will take to deliver on our moonshot of protecting life and reducing the number of deaths in civilian police encounters by 50% over a 10-year period. 2023 marked another promising step in that direction. We just recorded our fifth consecutive year of greater than 25% revenue growth, and we beat that far by a good amount, coming in at 31% year-over-year. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, the opportunity is right there in front of us. We're steeply ramping TASER 10 and Axon Body 4, we are building transformative new products and we've added Fusus and Sky-Hero, which together grow our estimated TAM by over $13 billion to a total of $63 billion. And I'd just like to say welcome to the Fusus team. This is your first earnings call as part of Axon and we're thrilled to have everybody on board. In the past, I've shared my vision on Axon's priorities over the next three to five years. We are focused on delivering the technology ecosystem of public safety globally. This approach supports our growth in two powerful ways. Number one, through new product introductions, which expand our ecosystem and deliver new value to our existing customers. And number two, through expansion into our new customer verticals, where our existing products empower new users to deliver safer outcomes and drive a clearer ROI. This framework has led us to invest in opportunities with federal and international governments, justice, corrections, and in the enterprise space. We finished the year with record federal bookings as we continue to see rapid adoption of both hardware and software within the federal civilian market. Likewise, the new Axon Body Workforce camera, or ABW as we call it, has driven strong pipeline in several segments within enterprise, such as retail and healthcare. One shining use case within the healthcare space is Fairview Health where they are trialing ABW with nurses as part of their commitment to patient and staff safety. A key to our success is that we continue to lead the market in innovation. It's no surprise when you listen to Rick that we believe our ability to innovate is a competitive advantage for Axon. Jeff's leadership in our product org combined with Rick's visionary thinking and foresight is an unmatched combination that gives us the luxury of doing two things in parallel, building the next wave of world-class products for public safety and identifying the most synergistic partners in the market, such as Fusus and Sky-Hero. Our standards are high and yet year in and year out, our products -- our product team sets a new bar. Before I turn it over to Brittany to go through our operations and financials in more detail, I'd like to congratulate several of our teams on some substantial recent achievements. First, the TASER 10 lead team led by Pat Madden. We are now four quarters in, and our order rate is pacing at more than four times what we saw with TASER 7. And then secondly, with Axon Body 4 product line led by Jason Hartford and David Mesri, we shipped more than 100,000 units in the second half of 2023, only two months after announcing the product. While these products started in R&D, they end in the hands of our brave customers, And a lot of collaboration amongst functions, or as we call it, #JoinForces, happens in between. Our teams deliver outsized societal outcomes together. As you can see, we're not slowing down. We are incredibly humbled by the trust our customers and shareholders continue to place in us and we remain committed to holding up our end of that bargain. 2023 was a record year and we are so proud of the team. But we are equally proud that that same team moved on from 2023 58 days ago. As we like to say, we're on to the next play. Over to you, Brittany.\nBrittany Bagley: Thank you, Josh. As Josh mentioned, 2023 was another great year for us with revenue growth of 31% year-over-year and Q4 revenue growth of 29%. We continue to be incredibly pleased with all segments of our business and continue to see enormous opportunities in front of us. In addition to continued strong top-line growth, we expanded our profitability with a 21% adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter and full year. This represents 160 basis points of improvement versus 2022, largely driven by leverage in our SG&A function. As we've talked about before, we continue to focus on expanding gross margins and expect improvement over the course of 2024 as we see the benefit from enhanced efficiencies with TASER 10 from manufacturing automation and cost initiatives as well as continued benefits from software growth. We're also going to continue investing in our R&D to support the opportunities we see in front of us and to make sure we can keep delivering strong growth for years to come. You've heard today and read in the shareholder letter the significant growth opportunities we see in federal, international, and enterprise, as well as for Axon Air, real-time operations, and new software capabilities to name just a few. We think we're hitting a nice balance of investing for the future while also increasing profitability and driving towards operational excellence. While we have leveraged SG&A, we have also continued to invest in expanding our sales and marketing teams to address new markets, improving our internal technology capabilities, and bolstering our financial strengths, including the fact we remediated our material weakness this quarter. This positions the business well to continue growing and scaling. Now, as I turn to our guidance, we expect 20% to 24% total revenue growth, or $1.88 billion to $1.94 billion for 2024. This is quite strong guidance for us and is the result of increased visibility for 2024. The strong visibility is driven by TASER 10 demand, as well as the continued strengths in our future contracted bookings, which has reached $7.1 billion as of the end of Q4, growing 54% year-over-year. Our software, which provides us with strong visibility, recurring revenue, and attractive gross margins, also contributes to the strength of our guide. In Q4, our ARR was $697 million, which grew 47% year-over-year. We continue to have a 122% net retention rate and strong customer satisfaction. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $410 million to $430 million, which implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%, up another 100 basis points from this year, on moderate gross margin improvement as well as continued SG&A leverage. This guidance includes the impact of Sky-Hero and Fusus, though we aren't going to comment specifically on either of their financials. Finally, last year we put out a 2025 target model of $2 billion in revenue and 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. As you can see from our 2024 guidance, we're pacing to well exceed our revenue target in 2025 and tracking nicely to our adjusted EBITDA margin target. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we expect to continue targeting a 20% annual revenue CAGR and a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. We think this is achievable and represents a very healthy, sustainable, and attractive long-term model. We're comfortable in maintaining this long-term growth rate based on the opportunities we've discussed and think this is the right balance of investing back into the business and generating attractive profitability. Also, while we have fantastic organic growth opportunities, we're very excited to be able to strategically make acquisitions in markets that will continue to support and grow our TAM like we have just done with Fusus. Finally, we are also continuing to target 60% free cash flow conversion on adjusted EBITDA and approximately 3% average annual dilution from stock compensation expense for 2025 and beyond. As you can tell, we're all incredibly excited about what we can deliver in 2024 to both our customers and our shareholders. We're looking forward to another great year. And with that, I would like to open it up to questions.\nA - Erik Lapinski: Moderators, can you bring everyone at the gallery view? Thank you. We're going to take our first question from Trevor Walsh at JMP.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks, Erik. I'm going to thank Erik and thanks everyone for the question. Maybe for either Josh or Rick. Excuse me. I appreciated the TAM outline in the shareholder letter as far as how that's expanding and kind of where Sky-Hero and Fusus are coming in. But there wasn't, unless I missed it, I didn't see any details around the Axon Body 4 Workforce kind of component or contributor to that. Can you maybe just give us generally kind of how you see that opportunity unfolding and especially curious to see kind of an adoption rate there, given it's a kind of a new vertical or user experience and how -- does it look like the body camera kind of adoption rate within law enforcement or does it kind of feel different from what you're seeing?\nRick Smith: Yeah, Trevor, thanks a lot for the question. I appreciate it. The first thing just to clarify is within the enterprise section of our TAM. That's where the Axon Body Workforce would roll up. And we could certainly talk through that more offline. And in terms of just interest in the camera, we had a launch event. We had some customers in town for it and some trial partners in town. I think this year is truly about, hey, how do we make our early customers really successful on this product and then build from there. It's not much different than the playbook we ran in public safety. And so much of it comes down to just having these early maven type customers that will help us not only build our brand in that space but also help us build the next iterations of the products. And so that's really what we're focused on. We really do believe the future is bright in enterprise. We're seeing that early on in the bookings results. We're not quite ready to share anything more on those at this point, but over the coming years, we do believe enterprise will become a bigger and bigger part of our business.\nBrittany Bagley: And just to jump on a little bit, so we gave enterprise a $15 billion TAM in our update, so that's where we see that playing in. And a lot of the Body Workforce camera really came because we were getting feedback from our customers as we were trialing it, largely in retail and in healthcare, about sort of the size and the weight and how they wanted to wear it and how they wanted to use it. And so we really took that feedback and we reflected it in the updated product. And that's what you see, We announced Fairview Health as an early customer there but we're really looking to be able to provide this solution into the retail and the nursing part of the market where they're facing a lot of challenges today around associates and nurses feeling safe in their work environment.\nTrevor Walsh: Great, thanks for the color, I appreciate it. And congrats on us all at finish of the year.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Trevor. We'll take our next question from Joe Cardoso at JPMorgan.\nJoe Cardoso: Hey, good afternoon everyone and I'll echo -- also echo my congratulations on the results and thanks for the question. So it's great to hear that TASER 10 momentum is tracking where you left off last quarter, but curious if you could just touch on how you're thinking about the margins tracking for the product. If I take a look at TASER gross margins, looks like you had some stability over the past two quarters. Just curious if we should interpret this as the floor for the segment? And then how should we think about the trajectory for the remainder or as we rather progress through \u201824, particularly in the backdrop of you guys -- you've been talking about it for a couple quarters now, bringing on automation, the cost efficiency. So just curious how you're thinking about the margin trajectory there. Thank you.\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah, great question. Thank you. We had a one-time event in TASER in Q4 where we had a bit of a manufacturing issue largely related to a batch in March of last year. And so that is impacting our growth margins in this quarter in TASER by about 420 basis points. So absent that one-time impact, they would still be down slightly on mix, but they would look much more stable sort of quarter to quarter. And so as we go into next year, that one-time impact comes out and that's where you start to get the commentary about how the TASER gross margins, overall we expect them to improve and they really are improving around our efforts for TASER 10. As TASER 10 mixes in, that's an impact, but then we're offsetting that by the fact that we're getting benefits from automating the line and doing cost-down initiatives as we go through the year.\nRick Smith: Yeah, and just to jump in and reiterate there, the issue was on TASER 7, not TASER 10 that led to this warranty reserve. And one thing I would point out is TASER 7 was developed prior to the current regime under Hans Moritz that's leading our whole hardware engineering group and we've seen substantially more rigorous free market validation and as a result with AB4 and the Fleet 3 and so far with TASER 10 we've actually seen more robust field reliability, lower return rates. So just want to make sure we didn't conflate that warranty issue was T7, previous design, not the current T10.\nJoe Cardoso: Got it. Totally makes sense. And then maybe just quick clarification on that front just in terms of the TASER 10 improvement, not to harp on it, but maybe just in terms of the improvement you're expecting through the year, is the expectation that it happens more linearly or is it more back-end loaded? Just curious just in terms of, like, as you bring on this automation equipment, is that more subject to being in the back half or is it more first half? Just curious how we should think about linearity through the year?\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah I think there's a number of different initiatives going on including the automation and then cost-down initiatives. And so I would expect you see that starting to roll in as we go through the year. So it won't be all back-half weighted, but obviously you'll see the cumulative impact of that more in the back half as we get all of those executed.\nJoe Cardoso: Thanks, Brittany. Appreciate all the color.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Joe. We're going to go to Jonathan Ho at William Blair next.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on the strong quarter. Maybe just starting out with a high level question. How should we think about the impacts from the Fusus and Sky-Hero acquisitions? I know you're not giving financials, but in terms of your ability to either sort of approach your longer-term vision or to cross-sell the products, just wanted to get a sense of the synergies that you see here with these acquisitions?\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah, I can start and I'm sure that the team will want to jump in. I would say that these are acquisitions that we're really doing for product and the team and the opportunity far more than we're doing specifically for synergies. So I really want to focus everybody on sort of the long-term market opportunity and customer opportunity that they bring in. All that said, I think there's some real benefits as we bring in these products and these teams to having access to our customers and our channels and all of the experience that we've had, scaling up these types of businesses, as well as giving them access to some of our infrastructure and support on the G&A side. And so, in a lot of ways, we're hoping that that really allows them to run faster and accelerate what they're doing.\nRick Smith: Yeah, and starting to respond there, I had muted myself. The other thing I would say is on each of them, they are highly strategic. So Fusus, what they really bring is, I described them at a high level, like the Switzerland of cameras. They've integrated with every imaginable sensor and CCTV camera, and we met them. We were introduced by customers who really loved what they were doing and said, hey, we want you to integrate Axon cameras onto the Fusus map because we don't want to have to open a different map and a different interface for every different vendor of cameras that we're using. And that's a lot of work to build something, Fusus has stayed away from building first-party cameras. And we really do want to keep that solution very open so that it can be broadly compatible with virtually any type of sensor, any type of camera in the market. We think that's critical to expanding the utility of our ecosystem to our customers. And then on the Sky-Hero side, long-term, this is probably not going to be big revenue in the short-term, but they are one of the, if not the leading tactical drone maker in the world used by special forces, by SWAT teams, and we think if we want to eradicate violence from society, we've got to get out of this mindset that the way you stop a person with a gun is sending more people with more guns and have a gun fight. And we think drones and robotics have a huge role to play there. I'd say that's probably a little longer term. It's not going to be a 2024 or maybe 2025 revenue impact, but 10 years out, we think it could have an enormous, both societal and revenue impact, especially in the space around private security where there's millions of people worldwide whose job is to sort of observe, report, and secure facilities. That's a highly monotonous job and one where drones and robotics -- we need to do a much better job at those monotonous jobs and when those jobs become dangerous, they could do a much better job than putting a human in danger when a threat does emerge.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Jonathan. We'll take our next question from Will Power at Baird.\nWill Power: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I'm in a vehicle, so I'm going to stay on video for a moment. But maybe if I could come back to software, I know you expect that to be one of the key drivers in \u201824, along with T10 and other products. Any way to kind of help unpack what the expectations for growth there are across the different components, evidence versus records, dispatch, et cetera, just to get a sense for the breadth of that growth?\nJosh Isner: Sure thing. And I think the answer, Will, really depends on the market segment. I think for state and local, that's where we're really, really focused on selling the officer safety plan and this bundled set of enterprise software from digital evidence management to reporting software to all of the key software add-ons, all in one place. And so, that's one of the true measures of success in the channel domestically. Internationally, it's really about, hey, how do we get folks on the cloud for the first time? And then, for some of these governments, it's literally the first time they're on the cloud in their professional lives. We're starting from a place of just arriving at that moment and then building from there over the next several years. Of course, in enterprise and federal, it\u2019s somewhere in between where we might not exactly sell some version of the OSP that we sell to domestic, but it might be some more tailor-made software offerings that are the right fit for those customers. And so for us I think, we always end in the same place, which is highly valuable, highly useful, high ROI software being deployed to customers that remain happy with it. It's just a question of the path that it takes to get there, and in each segment it might be slightly different. And so that's a bit of a summary for you.\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah, and Will, just on the commentary, I would say I was highlighting T10 and software particularly as drivers for improving gross margins. They obviously both will be great contributors to our revenue next year, but really all of our segments are performing incredibly well and they'll all contribute really nicely next year.\nWill Power: Got it. Thank you.\nErik Lapinski: Thank you, Will. We're going to take our next question from Alyssa Shreves at Barclays. I think she's dialed in.\nRick Smith: Looks like she might be muted as well.\nErik Lapinski: Oh, we're off mute.\nAlyssa Shreves: Can you hear me?\nErik Lapinski: We can.\nAlyssa Shreves: Great. Good afternoon, guys. Just a kind of quick question on the T10 demand. Is it -- are you seeing existing customers looking to upgrade? Is it penetration into new markets? And how much is this VR training kind of moving the needle in terms of T10 adoption? Thanks.\nJosh Isner: Yeah, it's a fantastic question. Thank you very much. This first answer is kind of yes to both. I think our existing customer base is very predictably upgrading, not only at the end of their useful life of their previous generation weapon, but for the first time we're seeing customers expressed an interest in an early upgrade to TASER 10. So we're really encouraged by that. Additionally, this is -- we do believe this will open new customer markets for us internationally and in some private security and federal use cases as well. And so across the board, very bullish on T10 adoption and the rate at which that adoption is occurring. So that's a little bit about the market kind of response to T10. Can you just remind me what the second portion of that question was?\nAlyssa Shreves: Yeah, how much of the VR training is kind of driving customer interest? Is it more nice to have or are customers kind of viewing this now as a need to have once they trial it?\nJosh Isner: I'd say we're probably squarely in the middle of those two at the moment. And this is a big year for our VR program, because now that the sensors work very well and very reliably, it's about how much content we can build to deliver to these end users to simulate different training scenarios. So it's a move from hey how are you performing with T10 at a range setting or some basic interactions and we'll build on that to these more complicated decision-making types of scenarios. So we think this is going to go hand in hand. Not only, of course, the training experience, if it's very strong, will help adoption of the product, but it'll also drive far safer outcomes in the field. If we're able to simulate the type of stress that you can feel in VR relative to shooting at people in costume or with Velcro suits on or at stationary targets at a range, these are the things that can really make the difference in the field. And so very excited about that. We're rolling it out to international as well. We're rolling it out to federal. We're tailoring scenarios for those markets. So we think these two products, VR and TASER 10 are kind of linked moving forward. And it's represented by the way we go to market as well where you pay one rate for both of those offerings and you get both throughout the term of the contract.\nAlyssa Shreves: Great. Thank you so much.\nJosh Isner: You got it.\nErik Lapinski: Thank you, Alyssa. We'll take our next question from Mike Ng at Goldman Sachs.\nMike Ng: Great. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just have two. First, there was the big step-up in future contracted revenue. I think that $1.3 billion sequential increase is the biggest on record. Is there anything to call out as it relates to outsized deals or customer wins that contributed to that, or would you guys consider that normal momentum? And then I have a quick follow up.\nJosh Isner: For sure. I don't think there was anything abnormal about Q4 other than it was a record quarter for us. And there is some seasonality in our business. It was our first quarter of $1 billion plus dollars booked across the business in five year booking. So we're really excited about that. We don't necessarily share much more than that on our total bookings, but that was a pretty big milestone for our team. So of course that'll represent itself in future contracted revenue and we're excited about that trend and certainly aiming to outperform that record this year.\nMike Ng: Great. And then just a follow-up for Brittany, just on that future contracted revenue, I know you guys have talked about 15% to 25% of that being recognized in the next 12 months. But I guess as the duration of that future contracted revenue extended at all, have there been longer-term deals? Naturally, the reason why I ask is it seems like you know 25% percent of $7.1 billion, you have full visibility into the 2024 revenue guidance. I don't know -- I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Thank you.\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah, of course it's a great question. It hasn't changed such that, that 15% to 25% percent guidance of what converts for the next year has been pretty consistent over at least the last few quarters. I think in general we have seen a trend towards some longer contracts. So again, Josh, Josh will correct me, but I think historically there were more five year contracts and now we're seeing more 10-year contracts and some that are even longer than 10 years. So that's certainly a factor in there. But nothing has massively changed in terms of how that future contracted revenue converts in for the next year. I do think it helps in terms of us having visibility and giving a strong guide for next year. And so I think that's where you see some of that come through.\nMike Ng: Excellent. Thank you, Josh. Thank you, Brittany.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Mike. We're going to go to Josh Riley at Needham next.\nJosh Riley: All right. Thanks for taking my questions. I got one and a quick follow-up here. If you look at the Fusus acquisition, is this a product that is going to require a little bit of incremental investment on your part to kind of drive broad customer adoption across the customer base or is this ready to go day one for your entire customer base?\nJosh Isner: Yeah, I'll take that. The good news is, it's a combination of the two. So right now out of the gate, one of the reasons why we were so excited about Fusus as a partner and then moving to the acquisition is that their product turnkey out of the box today is ready to go very broadly across state, and local in the US and then beginning internationally as well. It's absolutely a groundbreaking change for the ability for agencies with their real-time crime centers and command staff and even right in the dispatch center to get unparalleled situational awareness by partnering with CCTV cameras from [enterprise] (ph) and the like. So right out of the box, it is just selling and growing like gangbusters. And it's a fundamental part as we go forward of our overall real-time operations vision you've heard us talk about for a long time where our real strategy is to provide the best full stack and open ecosystem we can to help agencies with the entire lifecycle of an incident. And it's ultimately about our play to earn the right to win more sockets, meaning win more sensors, and win that pane of glass where they review the information from those sensors, and to win more and more communications moments as both first responders and the businesses where things happen work together to resolve as quickly as possible things when they occur.\nJosh Riley: Got it, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the TASER 10 automation. Is that going to also benefit unit growth in addition to benefiting margins?\nBrittany Bagley: I would say it does, yes. The more automation we have, the more it helps our capacity. I would say that's pretty much factored in as we think about next year though. So I wouldn't necessarily expect any surprises coming from that.\nJosh Riley: Got it. Thanks guys.\nBrittany Bagley: Thank you.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Josh. Keith Housum at Northcoast, you're up.\nKeith Housum: Yeah, thanks guys. Appreciate it. Can you guys unpack international a little bit more. Perhaps I missed this in the release. Perhaps talk about, if you don't mind, some trends that you're seeing with international. Obviously, I know there's a very strong bookings [query] (ph) for your last quarter. But how did it look this quarter both in bookings and are we starting to see some of that revenue that you booked last year come to fruition?\nJosh Isner: Yeah, thanks a lot, Keith, and great question. So we're super excited about the quarter we had in terms of bookings last quarter, I believe it was a record -- a new record in terms of booking. So the team's executing in terms of writing orders and driving a lot of the momentum in market. But there's just some noise around when the revenue recognition will occur. And I'd expect that to fluctuate a little bit more than it does in the US because you've got things like country by country approval of TASER 10. And so even if a customer wants it, in some cases, purchased it, they need to wait till all the testing completes till they can take delivery of it. In the video business, there's longer lead times on implementations because there's -- you're deploying to a country, a national government, not a city in a lot of cases. So the amount of sites and the amount of work and clearances you'll need to do that work is considerable. And so, all to say, the revenue will continue to be lumpy quarter to quarter based on shipment times and based on implementations. But, from where we sit, as long as the bookings number continues to drive, that revenue will fall -- it start to add up and fall to the bottom line in terms of EBITDA dollars as well. So we're certainly excited about it. The team has got the wind at their back after a couple of years of really trying to build more of an apparatus in continental Europe and we're starting to see the fruits of that labor pay off. So, the future is bright for international. Nothing's really changed in terms of our outlook or perspective on that, but there will be some peaks and valleys in terms of the rev rec over the course of the year.\nKeith Housum: And, Josh, maybe this one's for you as well, but in terms of the [Technical Difficulty] obviously you guys spent a lot of time on that again in the release today. But are you seeing new products and what's the strategy in terms of growing corrections and how you guys achieve the success you are having?\nJosh Isner: Yeah, certainly, Keith. We think the foundation of it, not different from any of our other segments, is tasers and body cams, but things like Fusus, things like drones, both indoor and outdoor, those are VR training and corrections. Those are investments we're currently making and we really believe are a great fit for corrections. And up till now, we've really talked about corrections as a domestic and state and local function. There's large corrections opportunity in federal, there's a large corrections opportunity in international. And I think all of those potential products fitting in is not unique to domestic. So certainly we're excited about that. And we believe, especially after the feedback we've been getting on some of our early meetings on some of these new products with corrections, that there is a lot of interest and those will fuel some growth in that segment.\nKeith Housum: Great, thank you.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Keith. We're going to take our next question from Meta Marshall at Morgan Stanley. You're up.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe, you talked initially just about kind of the drone business maybe not contributing necessarily this year. I just wanted to kind of get an update on, you had quotes in terms of feedback that you had gotten from certain customers, but just what are some of the hurdles to kind of greater drone adoption and just kind of an update on what was going on with the integration of Sky-Hero or just kind of early traction there? And then maybe just a second question just to kind of give them all at once. Just on -- it sounds like there's a little bit going on with headquarters decision. Just, is there a kind of drop-dead deadline when you're hoping to kind of make a decision on what city to do the expansion in? Thanks.\nRick Smith: All right, let me take that and I'll start with the drones. I think drones is an area where, again, we see tremendous long-term opportunity. Near term, there's a couple of different issues that have slowed, that are sort of, I think, were pre-inflection points, shall we say. So on the outdoor drones, there's a growing interest in drone as a first responder, namely -- today the way they deploy drones is the police drive up in their patrol car, then they open the trunk, they take out the drone and they fly the drone around. That doesn't give nearly as much benefit, right? Cause you've already got to get on scene to use the drone and then frankly from an officer safety perspective it's not necessarily great to be standing around staring at a drone controller. I think where the market wants to go is this idea of drone as a first responder where the drone is deployed from a fixed facility, flies to the scene and gets there before officers can. That started in Chula Vista, California. Shout out to Chief Roxana Kennedy there who really started this. We're seeing that, it is in the early stages of an exponential doubling pattern. Every year we're seeing about double the agencies doing drone as a first responder. It went from single digits to now in the tens of agencies doing it. In order for that to really take off, we need a little more clarity from the FAA on agencies being able to fly beyond visual line of sight, to be able to fly the drone safely. Today, if you want to fly drone as a first responder, most of the time you have to have a police officer standing on the roof under an umbrella, watching the drone fly into the distance. We have through one of our other partnerships with Dedrone, that is the world leader in drone tracking and counter-drone, we've invested in that. We've partnered with them. Dedrone gives you the ability, the NFL stadiums use it to track all the drones around NFL stadiums. And Ukraine is buying a ton of these to track drones for obvious reasons. We have some pilots we're doing where Dedrone is coupled with drone as a first responder. So instead of a human being watching into the distance, they can't see a drone beyond a couple hundred meters, we can actually track those drones in the airspace with this integrated solution. And we think that is going to be foundational to really letting drones really grow. Actually, let me pause for a second. I just may have had a technical correction for me on the growth rate. I guess we're going to be conservative. It was more than a doubling this year, but it was off a small base. So again, we're seeing really early exponential growth in DFR. Now when we think about indoor drones, Sky-Hero, when we acquired them, so one of the downsides of being a big company is we have lots of lawyers to make sure that we're very compliant and that's obviously a good thing most of the time. But for example, we discovered that Sky-Hero had some challenges in that the bands of energy they were using for RF transmission to get through the walls to be able to fly indoor effectively were outside of the acceptable bands under the FCC here in the United States. So we've had to actually pause selling on a temporary basis while we are working to get approval from the FCC and an exemption on being able to sell those to state and local in the US. But again, we didn't buy Sky-Hero for the near-term revenue. It's really about the relationships they have with the world's leading SWAT teams and tactical users, and we believe that's the foundation on which we can build transformative new capabilities. So part of it is just kind of getting, with Sky-Hero, now they're part of a bigger organization. The good news is, we've got both teams focused on international legal compliance. So we're kind of upping their game from a compliance and legality standpoint. Meanwhile, they're bringing their, I would say, young scrappy innovation. I mean, these guys built a profitable drone business with a very small team. Not many people have done that. And I'd say the magic is happening. They're working with our design team. And I'd say over the next couple of years, I'd say maybe a two to five year horizon, you'll start to see some pretty mind-blowing stuff coming out of our indoor tactical drones as well as our outdoor DFR. I think those are the two biggest segments, being able to fly outdoor drones without humans on site and then being able to go into buildings and use drones in the most dangerous situations.\nJosh Isner: That's right. And there's also a really exciting hybrid between the sort of drone in a trunk thing Rick talked about and full DFR as the whole industry tries to sort of find their way forward as fast as they can. And this is a thing that actually, Adam Bry, the CEO of one of our other partners, Skydio, and he and I talked together about it, their keynote of their launch a few months ago of their newest drone, where you combine the physical drone being with a patrol officer who can go to scene, but then the instant that they need it, you have that remote pilot who's able to manage it on scene in a DFR style. And so what you're seeing is innovation and experimentation to try to move as fast as possible while navigating around these various short-term constraints. And so it's just a keep watching the space.\nRick Smith: The last thing actually, I do want to add one more thing to all this complexity, the shifting sands between the United States and China is also creating another just change in the marketplace. So DJI was by far the dominant hardware provider, and we have chosen to partner with many different hardware providers. Initially, we were partnered with DJI, that's no longer very viable because the US government federally will not buy any DJI hardware and states are now passing similar laws. So we see up and coming folks like Skydio that have really just recently gotten to what I would say is a competitive hardware platform to DJI for the outdoor drone use case. We partnered with a company out of Switzerland called Fotokite that does tethered drones. So each of these things have created some short-term shifts in the marketplace, but we think the foundation is going be firming up over the next couple of years to see this go from really awesome concepts to significant businesses.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks so much.\nErik Lapinski: And then, Rick, did you want to answer the second question as well on the new headquarters timing?\nRick Smith: Yeah, we hope to have a decision by sometime this summer to make the call. This has kind of [dragged] (ph) on for a while, so we're -- we like to get moving on it.\nMeta Marshall: Perfect, thanks.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Meta. We'll take our next question from Mike Latimore at Northland.\nMike Latimore: All right, thank you. So within the cloud category, you have the digital evidence management, real-time operations, productivity software. Would their relative contributions to growth in 2024 be noticeably different than what you saw in \u201823?\nJosh Isner: So the question, just so I'm clear on it, Mike, is what type of growth are we looking at for 2024 relative to \u201823 in our software offerings?\nMike Latimore: Yeah, among those three, does one get more pronounced in \u201924?\nJosh Isner: Yeah. Jeff, feel free to follow on with your thoughts. But my instinct is DEMS is essentially built out, and we're on the right track there and we'll continue to build out that ecosystem into new markets and so forth. But, productivity is really the one that stands out to me as the huge opportunity for the year. I think we've bared all the pain of coming to market with enterprise software, especially historically custom enterprise software over the last couple of years. And now we really believe we found product market fit when we deploy this product to customers. We're getting fewer calls in the weeks following that are, hey, this didn't quite work the way we thought it would, or a new feature request, whatever the case may be. Customers are very, very happy with their early experiences with the product. And now we feel like, hey, we can start to dump a little more gasoline on the fire and deploy faster across more customers in a year. And then, the one aid of that, I'd say, is our response product, which is our live streaming product. And that's part of our real time operations pillar. And there, that's all the live streaming from the body camera that's where Fusus slots in as well. There's interesting things we can do you know between Fusus and in our DEMS -- sorry, our real-time products. So yeah, very excited about each of those. But in the short term, I think you know the biggest growth relative to 2023 year-over-year will come from productivity.\nJeff Kunins: Yeah, that's right. Thanks, Josh. All of those are incredibly exciting. I think the reason why we call it productivity is it is not only -- while it also includes our straight up product for full classic RMS replacement, it's really -- the vision there is all of the things that relate to helping, as Rick talked about in his intro, saving time and giving hours and minutes and moments back for officers to be out in the field, helping communities be better as opposed to doing paperwork or other things. And so there's an exciting story on multiple fronts there. First, you've heard us talk for a long time about transcription and transcription has been steadily and steadily and steadily been being adopted even for the straight-up use of looking at a single body camera video at a time, and being able to scrub through the video and see and search through the transcript of just that one video. And now, as that gets adopted more and more, we can build incredible new functionality on top of that using AI and other things. And so stay tuned for future announcements in that regard, but that keeps mixing up in customer [delight] (ph) and customer adoption. On [pure] (ph) records, as Josh said, now we've got more than 100 agencies who are live with at least one module of Axon records, including a rapidly still growing of those who have done their full RMS replacement, as well as a bunch that are using that Axon Standards product, which is the use of force module, which is the easiest thing for them to get started with alongside, even before they've made the full replacement of their RMS. So we're just incredibly excited about the trajectory and the momentum and the acceleration there.\nMike Latimore: Great. Thanks. And Just on the future contracted revenue, 15% to 25% in next 12 months. Can you just talk a little bit about the variables that would move that 15% versus 25%?\nBrittany Bagley: It's really about average contract length inside of that future contracted revenue. That's sort of the variable between the 15% versus the 25%.\nJosh Isner: And, Brittany, would you also say it's the number of TAP upgrades of hardware that would ship in a current year? So our upgrade cycle\u2026\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah.\nJosh Isner: \u2026is 2.5 years. So if we have a outsized number of contracts that year where these customers hit 2.5, we'll see more revenue because we're shipping all that upgraded hardware. And if it's a year where it's more software and the upgrade is next year, then that will be closer to 15% versus the 25%.\nMike Latimore: Okay.\nErik Lapinski: All right. Thanks, Mike. We've got one minute left. We'll go to Jeremy Hamblin for our last question at Craig-Hallum. I believe he dialed in on the phone. Jeremy, can you hear us?\nJeremy Hamblin: Yes, thanks. Hopefully you can hear me. Congrats on your strong results. Just in terms of -- I wanted to, just sorry if I missed the explanation on this already, but in terms of TASER automation impact in thinking about what that can do for gross margin on that product line, both in the second half of \u201824 but also then as we get beyond into \u201825, can you just provide me with a little bit of color on that?\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah, of course. So I think the TASER automation as well as initiatives that we're doing around cost improvements are a lot of what gives us comfort talking about how we think we'll have moderate gross margin improvement for 2024. And then we don't have any long-term margin guidance out beyond that. Our long-term guidance beyond \u201924 is really focused on the 20% revenue CAGR and the 25% adjusted EBITDA margins.\nJeremy Hamblin: But just following up, specific to that product line and not necessarily thinking about it in terms of total company, what is the -- if you undertake a project like that, what is the kind of the goal of the range of outcomes in doing that?\nBrittany Bagley: I think the goal and the range is to really improve the TASER 10 margins, so that you see sort of stable TASER gross margins over time rather than some of the fluctuations that you've seen. But again, we don't have a long-term target out there specifically for TASER gross margins.\nJeremy Hamblin: Got it. And then last one quick here. In terms of your kind of TAM penetration and opportunities, and as we think about, I think with Slide 15, if you look at adoption rates in rest of Europe versus your Commonwealth, I don't know exactly the timing, but in terms of thinking about the success that you've had in Commonwealth versus what you're seeing in rest of Europe, can you give us a sense for how that timeline is playing out versus when you kind of had some breakthrough contracts that you won maybe at this point, seven, eight, nine years ago? Just trying to get a sense for how that might play out.\nJosh Isner: Yeah, thank you, Jeremy. And it's nice to hear from you. I would say it's really a tale of two product lines there. On the TASER side, we're actually seeing Continental Europe already start to outpace the Commonwealth countries in pockets. And so, we're really excited about that. We had some large orders last quarter on the TASER side and we see the path here where, the nice thing is, in these Commonwealth countries, they're set up much more like the United States, where they either have states or territories or whatever the case may be. Some of these larger markets in Europe, they buy from the federal level. And so the order volumes are just much higher and you can really build with one customer with a much bigger kind of white space in front of you. And so we do believe you'll start to see Continental Europe really rival or outperform the Commonwealth markets as soon as this year or in the coming years. On the cloud side, that's where the Commonwealth were very early adopters, really across the board, UK, Australia, and Canada. And in Europe, I don't think it's secret, it's been slow. And maybe slower than we would have expected upfront. I'd say that's fair to say, but at the same time, we've really zeroed in on three markets in continental Europe where we really are starting to break through on the cloud. We've got trials going on or paid pilots even. And there, I think our thesis is, there's plenty of work to do and plenty of upside just amongst those few markets, but having a few really break through in the next year or two will be the kind of tailwind we need to start to steepen that adoption curve in other markets as well. So still some work to do on the cloud side, although we're seeing some really encouraging signs there. And on the TASER side, I think things are happening as we speak, which is encouraging.\nJeremy Hamblin: Great, thanks for taking the questions. Good luck this year, guys.\nJosh Isner: Thank you, Jeremy. We'll see you in a few months at your conference.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Jeremy. All right, we're going to take it over to Rick to close this out.\nRick Smith: All right, thank you to our investors for joining. Thank you to our incredible employees that I'm so fortunate to work with. Thank you to our new team members from Fusus and Sky-Hero. And actually today, we had one of our employees who had joined through an acquisition of iNPUT-ACE a few years ago. And I was just delighted to hear one of the things that is really important to me is that those new team members and employees find a new and exciting home where they want to stay. We don't buy companies because we're going to go in and slash and burn, cut costs and make money through the traditional synergies. We buy these companies because they are critical to our mission, their people are doing great work, they're innovating in ways that we're excited, we'll continue to inject that sort of late stage startup energy back into our own bloodstream and keep us going. So couldn't be more excited and grateful for the team of investors, employees we've got. Was out with Chris today showing Fusus to some customers and maybe some things Jeff was hinting at. I might need our redaction tool to cut out all the positive expletives I got today on some of our new capabilities. There's never been a brighter time to be at Axon and I can't wait for the rest of the year to unfold. I can't wait to be at Accelerate here in about a month. And I look forward to talking to you all again in May. So, thanks and have a great night.",

            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Erik, and thanks all of you for joining us today. Welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings. It's great to come back to you with another incredible year in the books for Axon. We kick off these calls with those videos to help you understand what we do. Sometimes seeing these kinds of scenes brings out different emotions. But that's what our customers face every day. And making those complex situations safer for everyone involved is what energizes us in our work. I've talked about my abhorrence for violence many times in the past. [Technical Difficulty] everyone who chooses to come to work here. We envision a world where violence is just far out thought, but we are constantly trying to find new forms of technology to make this a reality, and we're really proud of the progress we've made over the last year. First, with seemingly small things like adding a warning sound to TASER 10 to help communicate to someone on the other end that something unpleasant is impending with the hopes that that person will rethink their decisions and alleviate the need for a use of force action at all. And adding a watch me button to our body camera so that an officer can proactively request a second set of eyes for them during their most high risk situations. Next, we thought a bit more outside the box, introducing individually targeted probes, enabling far more effective range on TASER 10 and making our innovative TASER technology more effective in more situations. And we reimagined real-time operations, introducing two modern communication capabilities with two-way voice communication through our body cameras to help complex decision trees in real time. As we look ahead, we're solving for higher level challenges like enabling better decision making in potentially life threatening encounters, or effectively expanding a police force by reducing the extensive time that they spend on paperwork. And we envision accelerating the speed of the entire justice system. We're innovating in diverse areas from robotic security to Generative AI to virtual reality. And there's really so much more that's still left for us to do. When I think back to the video we just showed you, think about what would happen in those situations if an officer didn't have one of our TASER devices or was not wearing one of our body cameras so we could all understand what unfolded and why. It excites me that we made huge strides and that our technology is driving better outcomes. I think a lot of what we're working on now has the opportunity to become so pervasive in the future, it will be hard for us to remember life without it. Highly disruptive technology, that's the beauty of it. When you get it right, it quickly becomes difficult to imagine what things were like beforehand. But we're not always going to get it right by ourselves. We rely heavily on feedback from our customers, their challenges in the long term, rather than what's simply in demand today. While present needs do matter too, I spend most of my time with our customers on the vision beyond tomorrow, which is what I believe will drive our growth for not just the next one to five years, but the next decades. What energizes me in my time with customers is they provide us with the best and most actionable feedback on our roadmap, the snags and problems we may run into, and they help us think through the way to overcome those challenges and the best avenues for us to deliver them what they need. Most critical for us is making sure we have the right people to help us deliver for our customers. When I look at our team, I know we have attracted some of the best and brightest to come and work here. If it's not me meeting with a customer about a new product we have in development, it's somebody from our team. Our team works together, relays feedback and understands our common goal. We don't accomplish what we're doing in silos. We join forces across the company and together with our customers. This goes beyond our current team, extends into key partners like Fusus, who we're thrilled is now part of Axon. Our partnership with Fusus began a few years ago and we've really been impressed with their people and the product they've built. I'm traveling with their founder as we speak today. Together, we're taking our real-time operations to the next level and opening our ecosystem to an even larger network of sensors and devices which will unlock entirely new solutions for our customers over time. Before I hand it over, I'd like to say that I'm grateful that I've been trusted to lead this company for the past 30 years and that we've been able to maintain same drive and energy we had when we started. I might be a little atypical as a CEO as my day-to-day responsibilities align more with my background as a Founder than as a Senior Manager. I'm focusing on what's next. What's always important in driving any enterprise from a startup to a $20 billion public company is that we need to encourage people to be the best versions of themselves, but also to challenge each other, just as our customers will challenge us, and to share in a common mission with a culture that encourages us to do our best work. I'd like to provide one last comment on something near and dear to me. We've talked about our intent to invest in our new headquarters over the past few years. And we mentioned last quarter, we were revisiting those plans after we had paused work in September -- I'm sorry, in the summer of \u201822. Part of revisiting that has been working to bring our vision of a corporate campus to life. We would like Axon to remain headquartered in Scottsdale where we own a piece of land and where we have built this business. I love Scottsdale. However, it's not clear that Scottsdale wants Axon as we're seeing the political environment become more challenging and frankly, anti-development. It's unclear if we will get the approvals we need to execute our project. So we're exploring several geographies and other options. As a result, and it may take some time before we have a definitive decision on our next steps. We will keep you updated in the coming quarters as we resolve our plans and we make progress. Now, I know we're not a startup anymore, and that also means we need people focused on execution, making sure that what we do is viable and is executed to world-class standards. And I am beyond fortunate that Josh and Brittany and their teams here to help me in our execution. And with that, I'll turn it over to them now. You're up first, Josh. Yeah, Trevor, thanks a lot for the question. I appreciate it. The first thing just to clarify is within the enterprise section of our TAM. That's where the Axon Body Workforce would roll up. And we could certainly talk through that more offline. And in terms of just interest in the camera, we had a launch event. We had some customers in town for it and some trial partners in town. I think this year is truly about, hey, how do we make our early customers really successful on this product and then build from there. It's not much different than the playbook we ran in public safety. And so much of it comes down to just having these early maven type customers that will help us not only build our brand in that space but also help us build the next iterations of the products. And so that's really what we're focused on. We really do believe the future is bright in enterprise. We're seeing that early on in the bookings results. We're not quite ready to share anything more on those at this point, but over the coming years, we do believe enterprise will become a bigger and bigger part of our business. Yeah, and just to jump in and reiterate there, the issue was on TASER 7, not TASER 10 that led to this warranty reserve. And one thing I would point out is TASER 7 was developed prior to the current regime under Hans Moritz that's leading our whole hardware engineering group and we've seen substantially more rigorous free market validation and as a result with AB4 and the Fleet 3 and so far with TASER 10 we've actually seen more robust field reliability, lower return rates. So just want to make sure we didn't conflate that warranty issue was T7, previous design, not the current T10. Yeah, and starting to respond there, I had muted myself. The other thing I would say is on each of them, they are highly strategic. So Fusus, what they really bring is, I described them at a high level, like the Switzerland of cameras. They've integrated with every imaginable sensor and CCTV camera, and we met them. We were introduced by customers who really loved what they were doing and said, hey, we want you to integrate Axon cameras onto the Fusus map because we don't want to have to open a different map and a different interface for every different vendor of cameras that we're using. And that's a lot of work to build something, Fusus has stayed away from building first-party cameras. And we really do want to keep that solution very open so that it can be broadly compatible with virtually any type of sensor, any type of camera in the market. We think that's critical to expanding the utility of our ecosystem to our customers. And then on the Sky-Hero side, long-term, this is probably not going to be big revenue in the short-term, but they are one of the, if not the leading tactical drone maker in the world used by special forces, by SWAT teams, and we think if we want to eradicate violence from society, we've got to get out of this mindset that the way you stop a person with a gun is sending more people with more guns and have a gun fight. And we think drones and robotics have a huge role to play there. I'd say that's probably a little longer term. It's not going to be a 2024 or maybe 2025 revenue impact, but 10 years out, we think it could have an enormous, both societal and revenue impact, especially in the space around private security where there's millions of people worldwide whose job is to sort of observe, report, and secure facilities. That's a highly monotonous job and one where drones and robotics -- we need to do a much better job at those monotonous jobs and when those jobs become dangerous, they could do a much better job than putting a human in danger when a threat does emerge. Looks like she might be muted as well. All right, let me take that and I'll start with the drones. I think drones is an area where, again, we see tremendous long-term opportunity. Near term, there's a couple of different issues that have slowed, that are sort of, I think, were pre-inflection points, shall we say. So on the outdoor drones, there's a growing interest in drone as a first responder, namely -- today the way they deploy drones is the police drive up in their patrol car, then they open the trunk, they take out the drone and they fly the drone around. That doesn't give nearly as much benefit, right? Cause you've already got to get on scene to use the drone and then frankly from an officer safety perspective it's not necessarily great to be standing around staring at a drone controller. I think where the market wants to go is this idea of drone as a first responder where the drone is deployed from a fixed facility, flies to the scene and gets there before officers can. That started in Chula Vista, California. Shout out to Chief Roxana Kennedy there who really started this. We're seeing that, it is in the early stages of an exponential doubling pattern. Every year we're seeing about double the agencies doing drone as a first responder. It went from single digits to now in the tens of agencies doing it. In order for that to really take off, we need a little more clarity from the FAA on agencies being able to fly beyond visual line of sight, to be able to fly the drone safely. Today, if you want to fly drone as a first responder, most of the time you have to have a police officer standing on the roof under an umbrella, watching the drone fly into the distance. We have through one of our other partnerships with Dedrone, that is the world leader in drone tracking and counter-drone, we've invested in that. We've partnered with them. Dedrone gives you the ability, the NFL stadiums use it to track all the drones around NFL stadiums. And Ukraine is buying a ton of these to track drones for obvious reasons. We have some pilots we're doing where Dedrone is coupled with drone as a first responder. So instead of a human being watching into the distance, they can't see a drone beyond a couple hundred meters, we can actually track those drones in the airspace with this integrated solution. And we think that is going to be foundational to really letting drones really grow. Actually, let me pause for a second. I just may have had a technical correction for me on the growth rate. I guess we're going to be conservative. It was more than a doubling this year, but it was off a small base. So again, we're seeing really early exponential growth in DFR. Now when we think about indoor drones, Sky-Hero, when we acquired them, so one of the downsides of being a big company is we have lots of lawyers to make sure that we're very compliant and that's obviously a good thing most of the time. But for example, we discovered that Sky-Hero had some challenges in that the bands of energy they were using for RF transmission to get through the walls to be able to fly indoor effectively were outside of the acceptable bands under the FCC here in the United States. So we've had to actually pause selling on a temporary basis while we are working to get approval from the FCC and an exemption on being able to sell those to state and local in the US. But again, we didn't buy Sky-Hero for the near-term revenue. It's really about the relationships they have with the world's leading SWAT teams and tactical users, and we believe that's the foundation on which we can build transformative new capabilities. So part of it is just kind of getting, with Sky-Hero, now they're part of a bigger organization. The good news is, we've got both teams focused on international legal compliance. So we're kind of upping their game from a compliance and legality standpoint. Meanwhile, they're bringing their, I would say, young scrappy innovation. I mean, these guys built a profitable drone business with a very small team. Not many people have done that. And I'd say the magic is happening. They're working with our design team. And I'd say over the next couple of years, I'd say maybe a two to five year horizon, you'll start to see some pretty mind-blowing stuff coming out of our indoor tactical drones as well as our outdoor DFR. I think those are the two biggest segments, being able to fly outdoor drones without humans on site and then being able to go into buildings and use drones in the most dangerous situations. The last thing actually, I do want to add one more thing to all this complexity, the shifting sands between the United States and China is also creating another just change in the marketplace. So DJI was by far the dominant hardware provider, and we have chosen to partner with many different hardware providers. Initially, we were partnered with DJI, that's no longer very viable because the US government federally will not buy any DJI hardware and states are now passing similar laws. So we see up and coming folks like Skydio that have really just recently gotten to what I would say is a competitive hardware platform to DJI for the outdoor drone use case. We partnered with a company out of Switzerland called Fotokite that does tethered drones. So each of these things have created some short-term shifts in the marketplace, but we think the foundation is going be firming up over the next couple of years to see this go from really awesome concepts to significant businesses. Yeah, we hope to have a decision by sometime this summer to make the call. This has kind of [dragged] (ph) on for a while, so we're -- we like to get moving on it. All right, thank you to our investors for joining. Thank you to our incredible employees that I'm so fortunate to work with. Thank you to our new team members from Fusus and Sky-Hero. And actually today, we had one of our employees who had joined through an acquisition of iNPUT-ACE a few years ago. And I was just delighted to hear one of the things that is really important to me is that those new team members and employees find a new and exciting home where they want to stay. We don't buy companies because we're going to go in and slash and burn, cut costs and make money through the traditional synergies. We buy these companies because they are critical to our mission, their people are doing great work, they're innovating in ways that we're excited, we'll continue to inject that sort of late stage startup energy back into our own bloodstream and keep us going. So couldn't be more excited and grateful for the team of investors, employees we've got. Was out with Chris today showing Fusus to some customers and maybe some things Jeff was hinting at. I might need our redaction tool to cut out all the positive expletives I got today on some of our new capabilities. There's never been a brighter time to be at Axon and I can't wait for the rest of the year to unfold. I can't wait to be at Accelerate here in about a month. And I look forward to talking to you all again in May. So, thanks and have a great night."

            "name": "Brittany Bagley",
            "content": "Thank you, Josh. As Josh mentioned, 2023 was another great year for us with revenue growth of 31% year-over-year and Q4 revenue growth of 29%. We continue to be incredibly pleased with all segments of our business and continue to see enormous opportunities in front of us. In addition to continued strong top-line growth, we expanded our profitability with a 21% adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter and full year. This represents 160 basis points of improvement versus 2022, largely driven by leverage in our SG&A function. As we've talked about before, we continue to focus on expanding gross margins and expect improvement over the course of 2024 as we see the benefit from enhanced efficiencies with TASER 10 from manufacturing automation and cost initiatives as well as continued benefits from software growth. We're also going to continue investing in our R&D to support the opportunities we see in front of us and to make sure we can keep delivering strong growth for years to come. You've heard today and read in the shareholder letter the significant growth opportunities we see in federal, international, and enterprise, as well as for Axon Air, real-time operations, and new software capabilities to name just a few. We think we're hitting a nice balance of investing for the future while also increasing profitability and driving towards operational excellence. While we have leveraged SG&A, we have also continued to invest in expanding our sales and marketing teams to address new markets, improving our internal technology capabilities, and bolstering our financial strengths, including the fact we remediated our material weakness this quarter. This positions the business well to continue growing and scaling. Now, as I turn to our guidance, we expect 20% to 24% total revenue growth, or $1.88 billion to $1.94 billion for 2024. This is quite strong guidance for us and is the result of increased visibility for 2024. The strong visibility is driven by TASER 10 demand, as well as the continued strengths in our future contracted bookings, which has reached $7.1 billion as of the end of Q4, growing 54% year-over-year. Our software, which provides us with strong visibility, recurring revenue, and attractive gross margins, also contributes to the strength of our guide. In Q4, our ARR was $697 million, which grew 47% year-over-year. We continue to have a 122% net retention rate and strong customer satisfaction. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $410 million to $430 million, which implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%, up another 100 basis points from this year, on moderate gross margin improvement as well as continued SG&A leverage. This guidance includes the impact of Sky-Hero and Fusus, though we aren't going to comment specifically on either of their financials. Finally, last year we put out a 2025 target model of $2 billion in revenue and 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. As you can see from our 2024 guidance, we're pacing to well exceed our revenue target in 2025 and tracking nicely to our adjusted EBITDA margin target. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we expect to continue targeting a 20% annual revenue CAGR and a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. We think this is achievable and represents a very healthy, sustainable, and attractive long-term model. We're comfortable in maintaining this long-term growth rate based on the opportunities we've discussed and think this is the right balance of investing back into the business and generating attractive profitability. Also, while we have fantastic organic growth opportunities, we're very excited to be able to strategically make acquisitions in markets that will continue to support and grow our TAM like we have just done with Fusus. Finally, we are also continuing to target 60% free cash flow conversion on adjusted EBITDA and approximately 3% average annual dilution from stock compensation expense for 2025 and beyond. As you can tell, we're all incredibly excited about what we can deliver in 2024 to both our customers and our shareholders. We're looking forward to another great year. And with that, I would like to open it up to questions. And just to jump on a little bit, so we gave enterprise a $15 billion TAM in our update, so that's where we see that playing in. And a lot of the Body Workforce camera really came because we were getting feedback from our customers as we were trialing it, largely in retail and in healthcare, about sort of the size and the weight and how they wanted to wear it and how they wanted to use it. And so we really took that feedback and we reflected it in the updated product. And that's what you see, We announced Fairview Health as an early customer there but we're really looking to be able to provide this solution into the retail and the nursing part of the market where they're facing a lot of challenges today around associates and nurses feeling safe in their work environment. Yeah, great question. Thank you. We had a one-time event in TASER in Q4 where we had a bit of a manufacturing issue largely related to a batch in March of last year. And so that is impacting our growth margins in this quarter in TASER by about 420 basis points. So absent that one-time impact, they would still be down slightly on mix, but they would look much more stable sort of quarter to quarter. And so as we go into next year, that one-time impact comes out and that's where you start to get the commentary about how the TASER gross margins, overall we expect them to improve and they really are improving around our efforts for TASER 10. As TASER 10 mixes in, that's an impact, but then we're offsetting that by the fact that we're getting benefits from automating the line and doing cost-down initiatives as we go through the year. Yeah I think there's a number of different initiatives going on including the automation and then cost-down initiatives. And so I would expect you see that starting to roll in as we go through the year. So it won't be all back-half weighted, but obviously you'll see the cumulative impact of that more in the back half as we get all of those executed. Yeah, I can start and I'm sure that the team will want to jump in. I would say that these are acquisitions that we're really doing for product and the team and the opportunity far more than we're doing specifically for synergies. So I really want to focus everybody on sort of the long-term market opportunity and customer opportunity that they bring in. All that said, I think there's some real benefits as we bring in these products and these teams to having access to our customers and our channels and all of the experience that we've had, scaling up these types of businesses, as well as giving them access to some of our infrastructure and support on the G&A side. And so, in a lot of ways, we're hoping that that really allows them to run faster and accelerate what they're doing. Yeah, and Will, just on the commentary, I would say I was highlighting T10 and software particularly as drivers for improving gross margins. They obviously both will be great contributors to our revenue next year, but really all of our segments are performing incredibly well and they'll all contribute really nicely next year. Yeah, of course it's a great question. It hasn't changed such that, that 15% to 25% percent guidance of what converts for the next year has been pretty consistent over at least the last few quarters. I think in general we have seen a trend towards some longer contracts. So again, Josh, Josh will correct me, but I think historically there were more five year contracts and now we're seeing more 10-year contracts and some that are even longer than 10 years. So that's certainly a factor in there. But nothing has massively changed in terms of how that future contracted revenue converts in for the next year. I do think it helps in terms of us having visibility and giving a strong guide for next year. And so I think that's where you see some of that come through. I would say it does, yes. The more automation we have, the more it helps our capacity. I would say that's pretty much factored in as we think about next year though. So I wouldn't necessarily expect any surprises coming from that. Thank you. It's really about average contract length inside of that future contracted revenue. That's sort of the variable between the 15% versus the 25%. Yeah. Yeah, of course. So I think the TASER automation as well as initiatives that we're doing around cost improvements are a lot of what gives us comfort talking about how we think we'll have moderate gross margin improvement for 2024. And then we don't have any long-term margin guidance out beyond that. Our long-term guidance beyond '24 is really focused on the 20% revenue CAGR and the 25% adjusted EBITDA margins. I think the goal and the range is to really improve the TASER 10 margins, so that you see sort of stable TASER gross margins over time rather than some of the fluctuations that you've seen. But again, we don't have a long-term target out there specifically for TASER gross margins."

            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Rick. And good afternoon to everybody. I continue to believe there is no better place to be than at Axon. We are building the most talented, outcomes-oriented team in tech, knowing that that's what it will take to deliver on our moonshot of protecting life and reducing the number of deaths in civilian police encounters by 50% over a 10-year period. 2023 marked another promising step in that direction. We just recorded our fifth consecutive year of greater than 25% revenue growth, and we beat that far by a good amount, coming in at 31% year-over-year. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, the opportunity is right there in front of us. We're steeply ramping TASER 10 and Axon Body 4, we are building transformative new products and we've added Fusus and Sky-Hero, which together grow our estimated TAM by over $13 billion to a total of $63 billion. And I'd just like to say welcome to the Fusus team. This is your first earnings call as part of Axon and we're thrilled to have everybody on board. In the past, I've shared my vision on Axon's priorities over the next three to five years. We are focused on delivering the technology ecosystem of public safety globally. This approach supports our growth in two powerful ways. Number one, through new product introductions, which expand our ecosystem and deliver new value to our existing customers. And number two, through expansion into our new customer verticals, where our existing products empower new users to deliver safer outcomes and drive a clearer ROI. This framework has led us to invest in opportunities with federal and international governments, justice, corrections, and in the enterprise space. We finished the year with record federal bookings as we continue to see rapid adoption of both hardware and software within the federal civilian market. Likewise, the new Axon Body Workforce camera, or ABW as we call it, has driven strong pipeline in several segments within enterprise, such as retail and healthcare. One shining use case within the healthcare space is Fairview Health where they are trialing ABW with nurses as part of their commitment to patient and staff safety. A key to our success is that we continue to lead the market in innovation. It's no surprise when you listen to Rick that we believe our ability to innovate is a competitive advantage for Axon. Jeff's leadership in our product org combined with Rick's visionary thinking and foresight is an unmatched combination that gives us the luxury of doing two things in parallel, building the next wave of world-class products for public safety and identifying the most synergistic partners in the market, such as Fusus and Sky-Hero. Our standards are high and yet year in and year out, our products -- our product team sets a new bar. Before I turn it over to Brittany to go through our operations and financials in more detail, I'd like to congratulate several of our teams on some substantial recent achievements. First, the TASER 10 lead team led by Pat Madden. We are now four quarters in, and our order rate is pacing at more than four times what we saw with TASER 7. And then secondly, with Axon Body 4 product line led by Jason Hartford and David Mesri, we shipped more than 100,000 units in the second half of 2023, only two months after announcing the product. While these products started in R&D, they end in the hands of our brave customers, And a lot of collaboration amongst functions, or as we call it, #JoinForces, happens in between. Our teams deliver outsized societal outcomes together. As you can see, we're not slowing down. We are incredibly humbled by the trust our customers and shareholders continue to place in us and we remain committed to holding up our end of that bargain. 2023 was a record year and we are so proud of the team. But we are equally proud that that same team moved on from 2023 58 days ago. As we like to say, we're on to the next play. Over to you, Brittany. Sure thing. And I think the answer, Will, really depends on the market segment. I think for state and local, that's where we're really, really focused on selling the officer safety plan and this bundled set of enterprise software from digital evidence management to reporting software to all of the key software add-ons, all in one place. And so, that's one of the true measures of success in the channel domestically. Internationally, it's really about, hey, how do we get folks on the cloud for the first time? And then, for some of these governments, it's literally the first time they're on the cloud in their professional lives. We're starting from a place of just arriving at that moment and then building from there over the next several years. Of course, in enterprise and federal, it's somewhere in between where we might not exactly sell some version of the OSP that we sell to domestic, but it might be some more tailor-made software offerings that are the right fit for those customers. And so for us I think, we always end in the same place, which is highly valuable, highly useful, high ROI software being deployed to customers that remain happy with it. It's just a question of the path that it takes to get there, and in each segment it might be slightly different. And so that's a bit of a summary for you. Yeah, it's a fantastic question. Thank you very much. This first answer is kind of yes to both. I think our existing customer base is very predictably upgrading, not only at the end of their useful life of their previous generation weapon, but for the first time we're seeing customers expressed an interest in an early upgrade to TASER 10. So we're really encouraged by that. Additionally, this is -- we do believe this will open new customer markets for us internationally and in some private security and federal use cases as well. And so across the board, very bullish on T10 adoption and the rate at which that adoption is occurring. So that's a little bit about the market kind of response to T10. Can you just remind me what the second portion of that question was? I'd say we're probably squarely in the middle of those two at the moment. And this is a big year for our VR program, because now that the sensors work very well and very reliably, it's about how much content we can build to deliver to these end users to simulate different training scenarios. So it's a move from hey how are you performing with T10 at a range setting or some basic interactions and we'll build on that to these more complicated decision-making types of scenarios. So we think this is going to go hand in hand. Not only, of course, the training experience, if it's very strong, will help adoption of the product, but it'll also drive far safer outcomes in the field. If we're able to simulate the type of stress that you can feel in VR relative to shooting at people in costume or with Velcro suits on or at stationary targets at a range, these are the things that can really make the difference in the field. And so very excited about that. We're rolling it out to international as well. We're rolling it out to federal. We're tailoring scenarios for those markets. So we think these two products, VR and TASER 10 are kind of linked moving forward. And it's represented by the way we go to market as well where you pay one rate for both of those offerings and you get both throughout the term of the contract. You got it. For sure. I don't think there was anything abnormal about Q4 other than it was a record quarter for us. And there is some seasonality in our business. It was our first quarter of $1 billion plus dollars booked across the business in five year booking. So we're really excited about that. We don't necessarily share much more than that on our total bookings, but that was a pretty big milestone for our team. So of course that'll represent itself in future contracted revenue and we're excited about that trend and certainly aiming to outperform that record this year. Yeah, I'll take that. The good news is, it's a combination of the two. So right now out of the gate, one of the reasons why we were so excited about Fusus as a partner and then moving to the acquisition is that their product turnkey out of the box today is ready to go very broadly across state, and local in the US and then beginning internationally as well. It's absolutely a groundbreaking change for the ability for agencies with their real-time crime centers and command staff and even right in the dispatch center to get unparalleled situational awareness by partnering with CCTV cameras from [enterprise] (ph) and the like. So right out of the box, it is just selling and growing like gangbusters. And it's a fundamental part as we go forward of our overall real-time operations vision you've heard us talk about for a long time where our real strategy is to provide the best full stack and open ecosystem we can to help agencies with the entire lifecycle of an incident. And it's ultimately about our play to earn the right to win more sockets, meaning win more sensors, and win that pane of glass where they review the information from those sensors, and to win more and more communications moments as both first responders and the businesses where things happen work together to resolve as quickly as possible things when they occur. Yeah, thanks a lot, Keith, and great question. So we're super excited about the quarter we had in terms of bookings last quarter, I believe it was a record -- a new record in terms of booking. So the team's executing in terms of writing orders and driving a lot of the momentum in market. But there's just some noise around when the revenue recognition will occur. And I'd expect that to fluctuate a little bit more than it does in the US because you've got things like country by country approval of TASER 10. And so even if a customer wants it, in some cases, purchased it, they need to wait till all the testing completes till they can take delivery of it. In the video business, there's longer lead times on implementations because there's -- you're deploying to a country, a national government, not a city in a lot of cases. So the amount of sites and the amount of work and clearances you'll need to do that work is considerable. And so, all to say, the revenue will continue to be lumpy quarter to quarter based on shipment times and based on implementations. But, from where we sit, as long as the bookings number continues to drive, that revenue will fall -- it start to add up and fall to the bottom line in terms of EBITDA dollars as well. So we're certainly excited about it. The team has got the wind at their back after a couple of years of really trying to build more of an apparatus in continental Europe and we're starting to see the fruits of that labor pay off. So, the future is bright for international. Nothing's really changed in terms of our outlook or perspective on that, but there will be some peaks and valleys in terms of the rev rec over the course of the year. Yeah, certainly, Keith. We think the foundation of it, not different from any of our other segments, is tasers and body cams, but things like Fusus, things like drones, both indoor and outdoor, those are VR training and corrections. Those are investments we're currently making and we really believe are a great fit for corrections. And up till now, we've really talked about corrections as a domestic and state and local function. There's large corrections opportunity in federal, there's a large corrections opportunity in international. And I think all of those potential products fitting in is not unique to domestic. So certainly we're excited about that. And we believe, especially after the feedback we've been getting on some of our early meetings on some of these new products with corrections, that there is a lot of interest and those will fuel some growth in that segment. That's right. And there's also a really exciting hybrid between the sort of drone in a trunk thing Rick talked about and full DFR as the whole industry tries to sort of find their way forward as fast as they can. And this is a thing that actually, Adam Bry, the CEO of one of our other partners, Skydio, and he and I talked together about it, their keynote of their launch a few months ago of their newest drone, where you combine the physical drone being with a patrol officer who can go to scene, but then the instant that they need it, you have that remote pilot who's able to manage it on scene in a DFR style. And so what you're seeing is innovation and experimentation to try to move as fast as possible while navigating around these various short-term constraints. And so it's just a keep watching the space. So the question, just so I'm clear on it, Mike, is what type of growth are we looking at for 2024 relative to \u201823 in our software offerings? Yeah. Jeff, feel free to follow on with your thoughts. But my instinct is DEMS is essentially built out, and we're on the right track there and we'll continue to build out that ecosystem into new markets and so forth. But, productivity is really the one that stands out to me as the huge opportunity for the year. I think we've bared all the pain of coming to market with enterprise software, especially historically custom enterprise software over the last couple of years. And now we really believe we found product market fit when we deploy this product to customers. We're getting fewer calls in the weeks following that are, hey, this didn't quite work the way we thought it would, or a new feature request, whatever the case may be. Customers are very, very happy with their early experiences with the product. And now we feel like, hey, we can start to dump a little more gasoline on the fire and deploy faster across more customers in a year. And then, the one aid of that, I'd say, is our response product, which is our live streaming product. And that's part of our real time operations pillar. And there, that's all the live streaming from the body camera that's where Fusus slots in as well. There's interesting things we can do you know between Fusus and in our DEMS -- sorry, our real-time products. So yeah, very excited about each of those. But in the short term, I think you know the biggest growth relative to 2023 year-over-year will come from productivity. And, Brittany, would you also say it's the number of TAP upgrades of hardware that would ship in a current year? So our upgrade cycle... ...is 2.5 years. So if we have a outsized number of contracts that year where these customers hit 2.5, we'll see more revenue because we're shipping all that upgraded hardware. And if it's a year where it's more software and the upgrade is next year, then that will be closer to 15% versus the 25%. Yeah, thank you, Jeremy. And it's nice to hear from you. I would say it's really a tale of two product lines there. On the TASER side, we're actually seeing Continental Europe already start to outpace the Commonwealth countries in pockets. And so, we're really excited about that. We had some large orders last quarter on the TASER side and we see the path here where, the nice thing is, in these Commonwealth countries, they're set up much more like the United States, where they either have states or territories or whatever the case may be. Some of these larger markets in Europe, they buy from the federal level. And so the order volumes are just much higher and you can really build with one customer with a much bigger kind of white space in front of you. And so we do believe you'll start to see Continental Europe really rival or outperform the Commonwealth markets as soon as this year or in the coming years. On the cloud side, that's where the Commonwealth were very early adopters, really across the board, UK, Australia, and Canada. And in Europe, I don't think it's secret, it's been slow. And maybe slower than we would have expected upfront. I'd say that's fair to say, but at the same time, we've really zeroed in on three markets in continental Europe where we really are starting to break through on the cloud. We've got trials going on or paid pilots even. And there, I think our thesis is, there's plenty of work to do and plenty of upside just amongst those few markets, but having a few really break through in the next year or two will be the kind of tailwind we need to start to steepen that adoption curve in other markets as well. So still some work to do on the cloud side, although we're seeing some really encouraging signs there. And on the TASER side, I think things are happening as we speak, which is encouraging. Thank you, Jeremy. We'll see you in a few months at your conference."

Okay, every quarter we start you off with an earnings video and we do this so you can get -- so you look and feel for our business quarter-by-quarter. And so we're so excited this quarter we're going to double-click on our federal business, which is a very exciting expansion opportunity for us. So, last month, we had a great showing at the AUSA Conference, which is the Association of the United States Army Annual Conference. So we're going to play a video. We're going to take you there. It's about two minutes and then we'll turn it over to Rick. [Video Presentation]\nRick Smith: All right. Thank you, AJ, and great job to Richard and his team at AUSA. It's truly exciting to see the energy that our team brings to these events. I was on the ground at AUSA and I'm super excited about what Richard Coleman and our entire federal team is doing. Welcome everyone to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. It's great to be coming back to you with another fantastic quarter. We also celebrated the company's 30th anniversary in September. Let me take a big step back for a moment and reflect on our founding ethos and how that translates to today. We've just driven seven consecutive quarters of 30%-plus revenue growth while a growing profitability. And the formula has been very simple. First, we start by identifying a challenge or a problem that our customers face. Staying very close to our customers is part of our secret sauce. Every company says that, but we've institutionalized through frequent technology summits at our headquarters where we bring in a couple of dozen customers at a time to listen to them and to share with them our prototypes and ideas that might not even be products until 2025 or later. We also have an annual user conference. Our engineers go on ride-alongs and sit-alongs and we foster many other touch points with our customers. I cannot overstate the importance of calibrating research and development decisions off of direct customer feedback. When we develop alongside our customers, it helps us get it right on the big picture like moving towards robotics security, virtual reality, fused intelligence, for example, and also helps us get it right on the millions of small details and user experience decisions to create a delightful product for our customers. This should reassure you, our investors, that our investment decisions are sound. They are geared towards products that customers want and they've told us that they will buy and it's designed to drive growth for years to come. We also stay close to the forefront of the innovation curve. So we can identify how a technology can make things better, or fix problems entirely. This is how we were the first to evangelize cloud software to public safety in the early 2010s and why we believe we'll be first introducing generative AI tools in the 2020s. Our engineers are some of the best and brightest in technology. Like me, they are energized to go out and fix problems and they work hard at it. As a result, we end up with undeniably best-in-class product market fit. Strong relationships with our customers and employees who are motivated to partner with our customers to drive their success. Our growth today is driven by decisions we made five years ago. And while we enjoy an undeniable time advantage, while competitors are trying to catch up, we're now thinking five years ahead. We believe the R&D decisions we're making today will continue to drive growth for decades to come. And then, of course, we must execute on all fronts. So that's the formula, customer closeness, plus long-term vision, plus day-to-day execution, equals value-creation across the board, for the public, for Axon, for our employees and for our shareholders. It's a winning equation and we're excited about that decade ahead of us. Before I turn it over to Josh, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge the wake of escalating global events. These conflicts, wars, violence, and unspeakable acts, we're all seeing them today. We commiserate in the pain and suffering many people are facing around the world and because we are a globally connected company, the personal pain faced by our own employees and many of you listening to this call. Axon's mission, our mission is to protect life and we're focused on continuing to execute and grow that mission. You're up, Josh.\nJosh Isner: Thanks a lot, Rick. Every quarter here at Axon, leaves me more impressed with our team. As Rick highlighted, we just reported our seventh consecutive quarter with over 30% top-line growth. This kind of growth does not happen automatically. It's fueled by our ability to drive value to our customers and the momentum we have built over many years. While I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, I'll share with you a few things that keep me confident in the long term. First, I'd like to share my vision of where we will execute over the next five-plus years. We mainly sell into four key customer categories; state and local, U.S. Federal, International, and Enterprise. Each of those has a different path for how we tackle go-to-market, yet the overarching way to think about Axon is we are building the operating system for public safety and security across the board. A few years ago, we would say that we envisioned every officer carrying a TASER device or an Axon body camera and having a seat on our software network. As we built out this network, the vision, as you can see it, is expanding, so that from when -- so that from when an officer first interacts with the civilian to when a case is adjudicated, we are powering that workflow from start to finish. We have the team and the capability and we're going to continue to challenge ourselves to execute on that vision. And we remain really excited about the opportunities that we're seeing in state and local. Agencies across the United States are facing growing challenges. They're understaffed, navigating increasing training requirements and have to do one of the most difficult jobs in the world every day. This segment remains our core and we are investing and delivering solutions to help our customers. We brought two new devices to market this year, invested in productivity-enhancing software features and relaunched a disruptive VR training portfolio. When I think about our mission to protect life and look at the inefficiencies in the existing training landscape today, I think VR can be one of our most exciting long-term opportunities. We're also spinning up more customers on our records product, getting TASER 10 in the hands of early adopters and ramping shipments of Axon Body 4. Something I find particularly encouraging is our new order book for TASER 10. I've talked about my excitement here for the past few quarters and even my expectations have been exceeded. Simply put, we have found product market fit very quickly and the credit goes to Rick and our TASER pillar team led by Pat Madden for driving tremendous early results. Orders for TASER 10 after three quarters have already surpassed the first six quarters of TASER 7 orders, even as I read that boggles my mind. That means three quarters in, our TASER 10 orders are pacing at over 4 times the order rate we saw for TASER 7. What is encouraging is our top three TASER 10 orders, each came from customers outside of our core state and local base, two being international customers and one in corrections. Another customer area that has me confident in our long-term strategy is our U.S. federal business, as you just saw in the video. Our products are meeting the needs in several applications for federal customers where safety goes beyond the traditional state and localities and expands into the global footprint of our military bases where we can help protect those who have chosen to protect us. Five of our top 10 deals booked in the quarter came from federal customers, growing from a base of essentially zero a few years ago. Finally, I will talk about the traction we are seeing internationally, which grew 52% in Q3. We think international is one of the largest opportunities in front of us today and we are evangelizing the cloud, higher in country heads in new markets and spending a lot of time growing our brand and presence overseas. We've got line-of-sight into a strong close to our year and we are building pipeline to support long-term growth. It's been an incredible journey and it's easy to look back at what we've accomplished so far, but we don't spend a lot of time on that stuff at Axon. We're onto the next play. Now, I will turn it over to Brittany to go through our financials in more details. Brittany?\nBrittany Bagley: Thank you, Josh. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of top-line revenue growth and improving profitability in 2023. Q3 2022 was my first earnings call with Axon, and we were still talking about hitting an adjusted EBITDA dollar target. So watching the team move seamlessly the margins over-deliver and drop significantly more to the bottom line has been an exciting change that we're all proud of. I continue to be impressed each quarter by our team and the focus on operational excellence. We set hard expectations for ourselves and we exceeded them again in Q3. Our topline revenue grew 33% year-over-year and we saw adjusted EBITDA margins expand to 22.2%, which is 35% year-over-year growth. Software remains the largest driver of growth in our business with our cloud and services revenue growing 55% year-over-year. Our software business model remains a powerful growth engine. Our customers subscribe to a bundle of our products. And over time, we improved these products and delivered more new features and technology enhancements. Our strong software growth is tied to multiple drivers. We see growth from new customers, who sign new licenses and adopt feature add-ons. We also see many existing customers expanding their needs and growing with us over time. This is a result of our relentless focus on solving customer problems and driving innovation in the ecosystem as Rick discussed. You see that impact in our excellent net revenue retention rate of 122% and ARR growth of 54%. Axon cloud and services revenue is now 36% of total revenue, compared to 31% last year. We are also seeing our new hardware product launches drive growth in our business. TASER 10 grew more than 50% sequentially, representing healthy demand and our ability to scale to meet that demand. Axon Body 4 made up the majority of our body camera shipments in the quarter and drove our growth in devices along with continued strength in Fleet 3, supporting 45% annual growth in our sensors hardware business. Our third-quarter gross margin of 61.7% exceeded our expectations on a higher mix of software revenue. Relative to last year, we saw our margins mix down slightly on increased TASER 10 revenue, as well as increased revenue from sensors and professional services. We expect this impact to continue in Q4 with margins slightly below Q2 and Q3, on mix. Turning to operating expenses. We saw some leverage from both R&D and SG&A supporting expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin. We continue to invest to ensure we are positioned for a multiyear growth opportunity and to support the continued scaling of our business. As I turn to our guidance, you will note our strengthening outlook on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We are pleased to increase our outlook again. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $417 million to $420 million and fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%. Our Q4 guidance implies an increase in our full-year revenue outlook to approximately $1.55 billion or 30% growth year-over-year, which is up from our prior guidance of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion or 27% to 29% growth. Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin guidance implies a full-year adjusted EBITDA margin expectation of approximately 20.8% or $322 million. This outlook is raised from our prior expectation of approximately 20% adjusted EBITDA margin for the full-year or $302 million to $306 million. Our increased revenue guidance factors and growing demand we are seeing across our product categories, including our premium bundle offerings and the successfully executed launches of TASER 10 and Axon Body 4. For 2024 and beyond, we remain confident in our ability to scale globally to unlock new customer segments and to introduce even more new products that drive highly profitable revenue growth. And with that, I would like to open it up to questions.\nA - Andrea James: Thank you. Can we go into gallery view, please?\nUnidentified Company Representative: [Technical Difficulty]\nAndrea James: Let's take our first question from Keith Housum at Northcoast. Go ahead, Keith.\nKeith Housum: Good morning -- good afternoon, guys. Appreciate it. In terms of your guidance for the fourth quarter, you know, level precision that we have traditionally not seen from you guys with the $417 million to $420 million, I guess, perhaps comment on what gives you the, I guess, the level-off of that level of precision today and then what has to happen in order for you guys to perhaps, you know, be at the top end or ups even exceed that guidance?\nBrittany Bagley: I think a lot of what you're seeing is, we're just coming into our fourth quarter. And so there's only one quarter left in the year. As we look at that range in terms of what we're seeing on revenue, it just doesn't give a particularly wide range as you look back at the full year. So the look at the full year looks more precise and more tight based on what we're looking at for Q4. And then in terms of, you know, what we're baking in for Q4 or what we would need to see, it's really our, you know, estimate looking at our pipeline of customer deals we think we have in the quarter. We have good momentum, as you've seen across TASER 10, across Axon Body 4. And so we're factoring those in as we look at Q4, as well as, you know, we what we think we'll be able to do from a software standpoint. So again, it's the best guess. We don't always know what perfectly, but that's what we're looking at as we look at Q4 guidance.\nKeith Housum: Great. I appreciate it. I'll turn it back over. Thanks.\nAndrea James: Great, thanks. That's great. And if you are on this call, we've got you. So you can -- you don't have to put your hands up and we will be calling on you in the order that the random number generator selected. Okay, Trevor Walsh at JMP. You are up next.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks, team, for taking my question. Rick, maybe for you or even Josh, feel free to jump in. So I know IACP is a pretty, you know, major event for you guys and large builder of pipeline. What were you just hearing from customers there in terms of, you know, priorities for them both kind of finishing out the year, but then looking into '24 and where you see budgets sort of going around either a particular product or just a particular use case of what there, you know, if there was anything that kind of stood out in terms of kind of what's top of mind for customers coming out of that event. Thanks.\nRick Smith: Let me start first. The thing that I heard there was most interesting this year was customers really embracing the full ecosystem. So if I go back maybe three years ago, as we were really scaling, I think we had some customers that were saying, well, jeez, you know, I don't know how much of my tech stack. I want to put with one vendor like you guys are getting to be a big part of our tech stack and what I heard this year was pretty universally customers not saying that but saying, you know, we can't wait to deploy dispatch, for example, and these are customers who've never seen what we're doing in dispatch and we're still in the early innings there. But the feedback was, we've had such good luck when we deploy products and technology from Axon. It all just works so well and the customer services is so good. So that was a really intriguing thing to me to feel that shift in dynamic where customers were just saying, you know, we've done enough of this now and it just works so well when we go with you. We -- I had several chiefs at pretty big cities say, I would love to just be able to run my whole department on Axon because I trust you guys will deliberate and it will be both excellent and we'll give me new capabilities, you know, that maybe I have even thought of yet. So that was really a positive general sentiment. Josh, you want to...\nJosh Isner: Yes, I'd just add. I think, you know, it was an incredible combination of amazing reception around our newer products, specifically VR, TASER 10 and Axon Records. But then an equally awesome reception to kind of the early showcase products that have not hit the market yet, which gives us a lot of confidence going into the next couple of years here that the things that we will be rolling out have, you know, already, you know, the perception of really good product market fit and should have a lot of demand associated with them. Of course, we've got to do a lot on our end to execute well and to make sure we go all the way to the finish line on those products. But that's always a really exciting thing to see when what you're building resonates so clearly with our customers.\nRick Smith: The last one, I'd want to add in. Just to go into a little microcosm in terms of the detail was. I think this was the year that VR flipped from sort of conceptually interesting to ready for prime time. You know, we decided to wait for the all-in-one headsets. We didn't -- we did not, you know, want to push out a few years ago when installing VR meant room-based sensors and more complexity. We felt waiting for the all-in-ones was going to mean you could deploy a much greater scale. Now, that meant we had to do a lot of hardware development to make our TASER weapons work in a virtual world and, you know, some of the early things we tried were spaced around hand tracking just using motion sensors and to be honest, that was -- we were sort of getting feedback from our customers. It was pretty buggy. So we bit the bullet -- bit the bullet about 18 months ago to go all in on developing specialized hardware with the integrated infrared tracking lights, They're the same that are in the native HTC or Oculus controllers. And that has just gotten phenomenal customer feedback, where, oh my gosh, this just works, it's very accurate, it's no longer getting -- sort of buggy and needs to be recalibrated. So I think that was pretty exciting in terms of the near-term stuff that I think we've just had another product sort of crossover from that early developmental product market fit phase to where now it's just dialing it in, getting more hardware launched and scaling content.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks, both, for the color, and congrats on a solid quarter. Appreciate the time.\nRick Smith: Thanks.\nAndrea James: Thank you. And as I'm going down my list here, if you have video off as a courtesy, I'm not calling on you. So if you do want me to call on you, just come on video when you're ready to be called on. Joe Cardoso at JPMorgan. You're up next. Go ahead, Joe.\nJoe Cardoso: Thanks for the question, guys. Yes. So maybe a couple questions rolled into one. You showed the video in the beginning and talked to the opportunity in federal space or the military space. Can you outline perhaps the drivers as to why this opportunity is materializing in a more material way nowadays? Maybe how large this opportunity could be for you guys and, you know, which offerings are really resonating with the military folks? Thanks.\nRick Smith: Yes, so, I would start out by saying what's resonating is our existing product suite, which has been more focused on like military policing and protecting basis. You know, this year, I think the -- I saw the light bulb click at AUSA. In previous years it felt like we were, maybe a little bit of an outsider company from, you know, from over in law enforcement that was coming into federal. This year it felt like we were home. The promotional video showing how you use live streaming cameras, counter drone, you know, TASER 10, all in an integrated way. Our vehicle-based, you know, fleet solutions, our partnership with Fusus on integrating multiple cameras from both, you know, partner agencies as well as existing agency, really resonated to where it just -- it felt like people saw what we could do in base security. What I'm really excited about for the future is, we want to get into combat operations. And, you know, you may first say, well, jeez, you know, if your mission is to protect life, why would you want to do that? Well, because I believe successful military operations in the future will be those that kill the least, right? We racked up a big body count in Vietnam, and it didn't work. We killed a lot of people in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the more people we killed, the less successful our mission was. You look at what's happening in the Middle East right now with Israel. You know, imagine if they had more precise drones and robotics that could be going into those tunnels rather than dropping 2000 pound bombs with tons of collateral damage. You know, we will stay true to our mission to protect life. And I think, look, when I wrote my book the End of Killing, I believe we were closer to the end of war than it turned out. I was tragically and catastrophically wrong. You are seeing what's happening in Ukraine. But I think, you know, I wrote, I believe, in our shareholder newsletter last year or so. Imagine if we had invested in counter-material drones that we could have provided to the Ukrainians, where those drones would go out with fully autonomous artificial intelligence, not to kill people, to avoid people, but to destroy equipment. You know, if you could have brought 150,000 Russians to have to walk home because we destroyed the treads and the barrels and the engines on their equipment, while minimizing human casualties, you know, we think about, we have plenty of lethality. We're not giving a lot of it to the Ukrainians because we're actually trying to toe the line of not over-escalating. And I believe that sort of general thought process, how do we deescalate the level of violence and death to accomplish our nation's priorities and those of other sort of civilized nations is a huge opportunity. And this year at AUSA, for the first time, I had some conversations with people in senior positions in the military and military development programs, and I got a different emotional reaction. Now that's going to be years off. But I think the message is starting to resonate. You know, no matter what the mission is, killing should always be a last resort, and we should put a lot more creativity into how we accomplish our mission while minimizing the loss of life.\nBrittany Bagley: Just to follow up with some stats, you'll see some of these in the shareholder letter, but we have pegged the TAM, our total addressable market for federal at about $10 billion. And the other exciting fact we shared this quarter is that five of the top 10 deals we booked were in our federal business. And we've given a couple of examples of where we're getting really nice traction with federal customers. So the VA has gone live on Axon Records. The Department of Homeland Security has an IDIQ for our body-worn cameras and our software. The U.S. Army is renewing its TASER modernization program, and our first TASR contract with the US Federal government agency has been signed. So we're really seeing the momentum from the customers in the deals we're doing and in the bookings and think there's a pretty large opportunity out there just from an addressable market size to everything. Rick talked to.\nRick Smith: Totally and to speak to the timing a little bit, I think, you know, key, as you heard Josh talk about before, to our market expansion and our flywheel overall is this simple, you know, two-phase approach to every new market, which is, first, we earn the right to sell to a new class of customers by taking our existing products and tailoring them in the ways that are needed to make them resonate and have product market fit with that new customer segment while we build out that sales channel. And then once we've done that and have brought them into the fold as an existing customer segment we're strong with, then we've earned the right to go even bigger by building bespoke new products that are really tailored especially for that market segment. And that story is playing out resoundingly in federal. So over the last several years, we've made tons of investments in the background, laying pipe with things like FedRAMP Compliance, FedRAMP Moderate, then FedRAMP High, and IL4 and towards IL5, all of those sorts of things, as well as hundreds of small little adjustments to all of our core hardware and software products to make them viable and ready exactly for these federal customers. And a great example of that is the VA going nationally live with Axon Records this quarter. And then what you'll start to see over time that opens us up into more of that TAM as well in addition to selling more and more of our existing, you'll see us start to develop bespoke SKUs and product lines that are even more tailored just for federal.\nJosh Isner: Yes, I want to come back on one last thing. I don't want my comment to be misinterpreted. When we, for example, say we want to drive down police shootings, we're not passing judgment on whether police are justified or not. And similarly, with what's happening in Gaza right now, I'm not passing any judgment about the appropriateness of the use of force. The fact is, I think what the Israelis are facing right now is in order to get the military targets they're going after. Those targets are embedded deeply in civilian. They're intentionally buried in civilian epicenters. And so if you could imagine a world where a modern military could go in and put everybody to sleep and then sort out the good people from the bad people without a loss of life, that would be an amazingly important capability. Now, of course, I'm doing the imaginary end state of putting people gently to sleep. But there are steps we can begin to think about being much more precise in ways that are certainly causing less collateral damage and less lethality. And those are problems that get us really excited, because I think we're seeing today's technology puts people in unwinnable situations with catastrophic outcomes. And we think, you know, us and other technologists need to give warfighters and police and everybody better tools to be able to do the legitimate jobs that governments need to do to protect their people without such, you know, technology just requires inflicting a lot of death.\nJoseph Cardoso: No, makes sense. Rick, I appreciate all the color, guys. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Thank you. Next, Will Power at Baird. You are up, Will.\nWill Power: All right, great, thanks. Yes, I want to shift gears to international, another area where you saw nice growth in the quarter. It'd be great just to, you know, have you kind of unpacked, you know, what's driving that. And I'd be interested to know, is body camera, you know, four starting to help lead that? Is TASER 10 starting to lead that? What are the adoption trends look like there across the new products? And what are you kind of leading with in any particular geographic areas that are standing out for you?\nJosh Isner: Sure. Nice to see you, Will. And thanks for the question. I would say, it's -- there's a couple kind of different threads to the story here. The first one is that in our Tier 1 markets, which we talk about a lot, the U.K., Canada and Australia, those markets were just seeing wider adoption of the Axon network. So it's not only about TASERs and body cams and Dems, it's about our DEMS, DEMS add-ons, and it's about Axon Fleet and Axon Interview Room and moving toward Axon Records. So we're really excited about just the proliferation of our products into those markets that mirror the U.S. most similarly. And then we've got, you know, essentially a number of other markets that are starting to adopt one Axon product for the first time. A lot of the momentum has been on the TASER side, but more recently, we're actually starting to see some really encouraging signs in a few European markets adopting the cloud for the first time. So the growth of our international business will really be driven by continued execution in the Tier 1 markets, but starting to see more, you know, historically, you know, rest of world markets start to look a lot more like those markets where, you know, they're adopting cloud, they're adopting TASER, they're using DEMS, they value body cameras and other, you know, wearables and camera technology. And just the combination of those things is really going to provide that, you know, foundation of growth for the international business. I still believe, you know, it's very possible, you know, over the next five to seven years that our international business could be rivaling our U.S. business in terms of bookings. And, you know, once we get to that point, feel really good about the revenue catching up over time. So that's really our focus right now, Will.\nRick Smith: Hey, Josh. One thing I'd like to add there is, it's sort of fun to watch the company develop where there's some really healthy internal competition. Our software started out really as an enabler for body cameras. And I remember, we got -- it's maybe five or six years ago, there was a rallying cry, like, we need our software to stand on its own. It's best in class. And so the country of Scotland, basically their biggest move with us was not even with body cameras. It was digital evidence management for their entire ecosystem. And they're not really even using our body cameras at scale. So each area of the business, it all works better together. But we're now seeing the level of maturity across each of the subsegments to where they're winning best in class on their own. And that gives us multiple ways to try to enter any new market.\nWill Power: If I can maybe just follow up quickly. You know, international, you know, has been lumpier generally, I think, for you, all over a period of years, and yet it sounds like for your comments, you're seeing, you know, broader traction across a broader, you know, set of products. But how are you thinking about the broader pipeline internationally versus maybe where you were one or two years ago? That might provide confidence that this could be a more sustainable, you know, area of growth above the corporate average.\nJosh Isner: Sure, yes. Our Head of International Sales, named Chris Kirby, is doing a really good job managing the team toward the out-year of pipeline. So the focus has really evolved from like, hey, what can we capture this quarter, this year, to how can we do that and build a pipeline three to four times the size of the goal next year to just make sure that there's a little more consistency there. So, you know, there'll always be some lumpiness, especially in years where we feel like we've got a lot of TASER momentum because of just the nature of the revenue recognition on TASER versus, you know, the SaaS products. And so, you know, if -- you know, if large international police forces are buying TASERs, you'll see some of those kind of lumpy one-time revenue events. But over the long term, you know, I think that's -- we're already starting to see that kind of balance out and that's, you know, buoyed by a foundation of video bookings and more video adoption.\nWill Power: Thank you.\nAndrea James: Mike Ng at Goldman Sachs. You're up next.\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. Mine is just on Axon cloud and services. So it seems like we've seen two consecutive quarters of greater than $15 million quarter-on-quarter revenue growth. I was just wondering if you could expand a little bit about the key drivers of the strength. I know in the letter, you know, you talked a little bit about, you know, moving more towards premium software bundles, the growing install base, just any additional color that you could provide there would be great. And then is that a good way to think about Axon cloud and services growth going forward, kind of this teen sequential growth? Thank you.\nJosh Isner: Sure. Yes, We're -- Mike, we're really glad you asked that question because, you know, that's one of the things we're most proud of here to see in the results is just this, you know, excitement around the Axon cloud suite of products. And, you know, the story here has been just multiple years of investment into new features, software add-ons, new enterprise software products, just finding product market fit and being rapidly adopted by our customer base. And ultimately, you know, more and more customers are buying our premium offerings, starting with the Officer Safety Plan and then going up to the Plus version of that and then the Premium version of that. And we've seen that the last couple of years, but now it's really starting to flow through into the revenue and the results. And so, you know, just, you know, more adoption of DEMS, more adoption of software add-ons, more adoption of Records management, more adoption of our standards product. And it's really exciting to see all that come together. Talked a lot about our flywheel of this idea that really, you know, OSP is the driver of that flywheel into new products and that's exactly what we're seeing right now. So really proud of our product team for doing a great job, you know, understanding where this, you know, where this platform evidence.com can take us and listening to our customers in terms of where they see value and then doing an incredible job building those products. And our sales team is doing a great job selling them on the back end. So things are aligning really, really nicely in the cloud business and we're really excited about it.\nBrittany Bagley: From a modeling standpoint for all of you guys. The only thing I would add is we have historically guided you to take an average of, you know, the last six to eight quarters. And think about that as the size of the step up in that revenue. I think because of this impact that Josh talked about of more and more customers moving to our premium bundles, the size of that step will start to get bigger every quarter. It probably won't be as big as it was this quarter, though, because you are seeing some of the benefit of the Fleet 3 installations start to turn on and come into that. So while there was nothing, you know, one time this quarter, you are seeing Fleet 3 come in. But I think we're also comfortable saying that because of premium, we are going to see slightly larger steps up each quarter in software than we have historically averaged out.\nMike Ng: Wonderful. And maybe if I could just have a quick follow-up. You know, if we assume a kind of continued step up in that cloud revenue, you know, is there something that's offsetting that as you think about the consolidated revenue guidance for the fourth quarter on the product side? Thanks, Brittany. Thanks, Josh.\nBrittany Bagley: Yes. So I would say I think the step up in software is particularly large this quarter. So I don't think there's anything offsetting it. As you look at Q4, you know, we're putting forth pretty healthy growth year-over-year, 24% to 25%. That's on top of a Q4 quarter last year that grew about 55%. So I think it's still a very healthy guide that is taking into account the premium software piece. AB4, TASER 10, all the momentum we're seeing.\nMike Ng: Wonderful. Thanks for the follow-up. Brittany.\nBrittany Bagley: Of course.\nAndrea James: Hey, Jonathan Ho at William Blair, go ahead.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, congrats on the strong quarter. Can you help us understand what some of the main components were that drove the 122% net retention growth this quarter?\nRick Smith: Sure. Hey, look, it always helps when you have new products that people want to buy. Like, that's the underlying, you know, thing there is, you know, again, this goes back to our product team really doing a fantastic job just building new value into evidence.com with new -- with these, you know, new software features that save legitimate time every police officer shift. And so when we can keep showing that type of ROI, every conversation on a renewal or an upsell is not only, you know, a -- driven by satisfaction with what the customer already has, but it's driven by interest in what we're doing next and how they can participate in that. And so when you have that combination, we have a very, very talented customer success organization that, you know, really drives deep relationships with our customers. The -- and any, you know, a side note, any account that is managed by a customer success manager at Axon, their NPS score is 81 right now. So that's, you know, an off the charts high number when you think about the range of NPS going from negative 100 to 100. And so that just shows the type of trust these customers have built in our customer success team, our product team, our sales team, so forth. And so, you know, all those things being true, it actually is, you know, it just comes down to execution in terms of, you know, sales and account management to get these deals across the finish line. And we see ARPUs going up as a result. And then NRR, you know, is also rising as a result of that.\nJonathan Ho: Great. And then in terms of the DHS and U.S. federal government contracts that you've signed, is there potentially a halo effect here? Meaning, you know, does this help you sell to other federal law enforcement agencies or international agencies, you know, that maybe look up to these, you know, federal and defense contracts? Thank you.\nJosh Isner: Sure, I'd say within the federal government, there's certainly a network effect there. No question. You know, once we've started with being FedRAMP authorized, that was kind of a big breakthrough for us. And then, you know, Impact level 5, et cetera, just all the kind of table stakes, clearances that our products needed to achieve. And then, you know, once, you know, the Customs and Border Protection has been a really great customer of ours. We heavily value that relationship. And having a lot of momentum there has just kind of permeated out into other branches of the federal civilian space. Rick talked about the opportunity in the military as well. I think there is something there to leveraging our success federally into other international governments. That's happening a little bit here and there, but there is potential that that could accelerate. So, yes, I'm really pleased to see, you know, the types of network effects we've seen in the federal space.\nAndrea James: Meta Marshall at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Meta.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. And congrats on the quarter. Maybe just as a first question, just in terms of kind of the increase, ways that you guys plan to use AI and automation, just where are kind of customer conversations on just ways in which they want to see you incorporate some of these features, ways in which, you know, they just kind of want to get their heads around some of that. And then just maybe as a second question for you, Brittany, you know, gross margins obviously took a small step down quarter-on-quarter, but were better than expected. Is that -- some of that just from kind of the scale, or is some of that just the ramp of Fleet 10 just kind of having smaller headwinds than expected? Thanks.\nRick Smith: Let me start with the AI question, and we're going to be a little cagey here. I will tell you, at IACP, I was showcasing a prototype, a functioning prototype of an AI-powered service, and it got, if not the strongest, one of the most positive, strongest reactions I've ever seen in a product. Obviously, we have a ton of data that we could be running AI on. The art of this is to figure out where can we create maximum customer value while mitigating the risks that are associated, you know, with what can go wrong in AI. And we think we found at least one very powerful use case. But I'm not going to give any more details for competitive reasons, but stay tuned. Exciting times ahead.\nBrittany Bagley: Okay. Which leaves us with gross margins? So I would say gross margins were better than expected, really, on the incredibly strong software performance in the quarter. So our software business is gross margin accretive for us. And so the more we build up there, the better overall impact for our gross margin. So I would drive most of the outperformance there. As I think about, you know, why was it down, you know, still a bit year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter? That's really just on mix of our sensors business and the fact that our sensors business also performed incredibly well and the fact that our TASER 10 is also performing quite well. Our TASER margins overall improved quarter-over-quarter, but the mix in there of TASER 10 was quite high.\nAndrea James: Yes. Thank you, Meta. Josh Reilly at Needham. You're up.\nJosh Reilly: All right. Thanks for taking my questions. In terms of the Department of Veterans Affairs Records win, can you just discuss what some of the factors were in that win? That's obviously a very large deployment. Curious if your openness to third-party or best-of-breed modules was a factor in that one.\nRick Smith: Josh, thanks for the question. And to answer directly, no, that wasn't a big driver. Instead, it was just this connected story around digital evidence in reporting. And that we think is consistent across pretty much every customer interested in Axon Records, which is they just see this link where, hey, if you have the video and you see what happened in the video, like what effect does that have on the ability to write a police report, you know, easily in a scalable and simple way. And so, you know, going back, you know, Brian Wheeler, we've talked about from time to time in terms of his leadership of our records product and his team just continues to perform very well in that regard. And our customers are seeing the value. And then, you know, like we mentioned before, having a FedRAMP-authorized cloud RMS product just aids in the momentum there. So it's really a combination of those things all coming together.\nJosh Isner: There are two other things, I would add. One is just the customer relationship, namely, as they deployed our evidence.com and our other products, they just had a great experience that they shared with us was just different than they had with previous technology. So that set us up for the win. Then the other piece I would say is, we made a decision years ago when we are building records that we were not going to go try to win in RFPs for Record systems because we believe that's a recipe for building bad software. If you go build, you know, 800 checkboxes that all the great on the paper report you submit for the RFP, you're going to build a lot of breadth and there's almost no reward for good user experience. And we structured a lot of our go-to-market around how do we win in the hands of the user and set this up where we can build great software that does the most important things really, really, really well and then integrate other systems to handle sort of the fringes and the breadth of it. And I think that was a, you know, pretty important here where what we were able to show them was a functional system that they could test out and go, wow, this just works great in the hands of the user because we spent the time to build it that way, you know, bringing in people with consumer backgrounds that are used to building UI. That's got to be super intuitive, not built to a large government spec document. No offense to government, you know, procurement specifications, but there's a reason government spec software is typically not great, and that's because, you know, you're building it to very large specs. And in there, there's typically not a real easy way to quantify the user experience. And we focus on user experience first and then identifying which of those specs are the really important ones to the people actually using it. And I think that philosophy, we did not expect to win a federal agency this early in Records lifecycle. So it was a really pleasant surprise.\nJosh Reilly: Got it. And then just to follow-up on the profitability piece. You've done a really nice job of managing profitability and higher margins over the last year. As we see this, you know, the growth opportunity in terms of revenue appears sustainable even in this kind of challenging macro. Should we expect additional hiring over the coming quarters, or can you manage the growth in business with kind of the current headcount, which would imply more operating leverages coming? Thank you.\nBrittany Bagley: I think a bit of both. So we're absolutely going to keep hiring. I think, first of all, our stated goal in R&D is to invest basically top-line growth back into R&D. You can hear all of the exciting things that even with what we're doing, we still feel like we can work on and we have in front of us. And so there's going to continue to be a very robust pace of hiring from an R&D standpoint. Again, we won't get ahead of our revenue growth, but we're really investing there. Then on the SG&A side, we will absolutely get leverage in SG&A, but we can't do what we need to do with flat headcount from where we are today. We do need to continue to invest. Some of that is in sales, but honestly, a lot of that is really on the G&A side as we, you know, figure out how we can get this company to support the level of top-line growth that we're delivering on. You know, better IT systems, get our material weakness remediated, do a lot of that housekeeping that hopefully we very much keep in the background and you don't see, but will overfire investment to deliver nicely on all of these opportunities in front of us. And will give you some leverage too, because we still have our 25% adjusted EBITDA margin target out there. So hopefully this year shows that we can deliver and head towards that. And you all believe us that we're going to hit that. But there is a balance to do between here and there.\nJosh Isner: And of course, world-class tech recruiting requires world-class tech recruiters. So that's also part of that fun picture.\nJosh Reilly: Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nAndrea James: Awesome. I want to respect Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum. We haven't called on you. You've been off video. Do you want to ask a question? I know people are juggling multiple earnings calls and does anybody have any follow-ups? Oh, no, we've got Jeremy. Jeremy, go ahead, you're up.\nJeremy Hamblin: Yes, Hey, thanks. And yes, juggling calls here. You know, I wanted to and apologies if you've gone through this a little bit already, but I wanted to come back into the Fleet product just to understand, you know, where we are in terms of, you know, it looks like you've really continued to gain share in that product and, you know, in terms of where we go in the platform and tying that in, you know, more holistically with, you know, some of the things you're trying to do on the AI side of the business as we move, you know, a couple of, let's say, years down the road. You know, I wanted to just understand in terms of where you think about the TAM on that portion of the business and whether or not just the total value of what the Fleet business is changed from where it might have been a couple of years ago.\nRick Smith: Well, let me start on this one. This is one where I was just wrong. I assumed that body cameras would obsolete in car cameras. And I believed that once body cameras became ubiquitous, there would be less reason to have cameras in a car. And that's one where just I was wrong. And what I learned was that, you know, customers who've had in car cameras want to keep that perspective, especially state highway patrols, where a lot happens in front of the vehicle, and the availability of extra battery power and the ability to put more sensors to be able to do things like license plate reading, which, you know, would be not possible given the battery constraints in the body camera. So I'm happy to have been wrong and had, you know, people who together with our customers who educated me on that, to where now we have a sizable, and I think the market leading Fleet product, and we're finding other areas, you know, in some adjacent markets, and ambulances and EMS, I think even in the military, you know, starting with vehicles that are more like military policing vehicles. But over time, the array of capability and our ability to move at sort of commercial speed to bring AI and sensor capabilities, I think there could be opportunities for us to move up the value chain from just sort of policing vehicles into other types of vehicles where we can integrate our network, all of our workflow together with our sensor development, and of course, in the future, AI running on all that data. So I don't know that I could give an exact like TAM comparison between the two, but I would say that the vehicle Fleet business is certainly here to stay, and it just -- it has different needs and requirements, and you can do more when you've got, you know, access to power and a little more space to be able to put more equipment and more powerful sensors.\nJeremy Hamblin: Yes, no, that's to the crux of the question. And then just a follow-up also on comment that Brittany had made. You know, in terms of the cloud portion of the business and thinking about these slightly larger jumps that we're going to see in that business. Just wanted to understand, in terms of thinking a year, two years down the road on your gross margins given what you're generating on that portion of the business and the bigger jumps, is that something that we should expect the model to iterate as we drive towards 25% EBITDA margins, is that going to be a decent portion of what gets us there?\nBrittany Bagley: You know, we haven't given any commentary on how we get to that 25% between gross margins and OpEx leverage, other than to say, you know, we're obviously looking really closely at both of them. I think for as much as software is a benefit to our overall gross margins, you also see incredible success in our sensors business, and that's a drag on gross margins. I'd still take all the growth we get from there. And to your question, on Fleet, you know, right now, that's part of our $9 billion camera TAM. But I think we still feel like we've got nice penetration opportunities and good runway in front of us on Fleet still. We've talked a little bit about how we were playing catch up this year and next year will normalize a bit. But it's really some of those mixed dynamics that we're going to be working on as we balance between gross margin and OpEx leverage. I think the last thing we've been focused on is improving our overall TASER gross margins as we continue to leverage and scale TASER 10. So we've got a couple of benefits to gross margin over the next couple of years, and then we just have to balance that out with mix, if that makes sense.\nJeremy Hamblin: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for taking the questions.\nAndrea James: Thank you.\nBrittany Bagley: Of course.\nAndrea James: Thank you. One more from Jonathan Ho at William Blair, and then we will close out.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you. Just one final question for me. Just given the TASER 10 strengths that you referenced on the call, you know, have you been able to shift to the demand or is there, you know, potentially an accumulation of backlog here as well? Thank you.\nRick Smith: Go ahead, Brittany.\nBrittany Bagley: I was going to say it's a great question. We are working really hard to ramp our capacity, but I think you can see from some of the growth numbers and some of what we have been delivering that we're doing a nice job getting our capacity ramped up. As we continue to go into next year, what we're really working on is getting more of that capacity automated.\nAndrea James: Great. Okay, pregnant pause. All right, Rick, go ahead and close this out.\nRick Smith: All right, before we sign off, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank you, Andrea James. This is going to be Andrea's last quarterly earnings call with us here on Zoom. So after a fast-paced and transformative six years with Axon, leading investor relations, Strategy and Communication, AJ is going to take some time to reset and enjoy the fruits of the success that she's had and has driven here at Axon. AJ has been one of my closest personal advisors. And so as we got to the end of the last XSP and we had some conversations about life and the future, I remembered one of my favorite quotes from Ray Kurzweil, the most important decisions we make are how we spend our time. And back around 2013, when my kids were in preschool, I had the wonderful opportunity to go spend a year in Europe and walk my kids to kindergarten every day And talking with AJ about her budding and growing family, I couldn't disagree with the assessment that how she spends her time might be to take advantage of some of the success from Axon. So we talked about her doing advisory and board work, given the amazing experience she's had at Tesla and here at Axon. So I'll be keeping on speed dial. AJ, and, you know, just very personally and professionally grateful to have you a colleague and a friend and want to acknowledge your great service towards our mission. I know you've -- she's also formed relationships with so many of you and it's not fully goodbye. She'll continue to support us behind the scenes in an advisory role into at least the middle of next year to ensure a smooth transition. And we are thrilled that Erik joined us earlier this year to help -- to lead our IR efforts. He's really hit the ground running, He is really there to catch the baton from one of the greats. And having been an analyst in our industry for several years, Erik, that is before joining Axon. And with that, I want to thank all of you for joining. We're proud of our team's execution. We're confident in our profitable growth. We look forward to a strong finish to the year. I wish you all a happy and wonderful holiday season. I hope the world finds more peace and we will see you all in February.",

            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, AJ, and great job to Richard and his team at AUSA. It's truly exciting to see the energy that our team brings to these events. I was on the ground at AUSA and I'm super excited about what Richard Coleman and our entire federal team is doing. Welcome everyone to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. It's great to be coming back to you with another fantastic quarter. We also celebrated the company's 30th anniversary in September. Let me take a big step back for a moment and reflect on our founding ethos and how that translates to today. We've just driven seven consecutive quarters of 30%-plus revenue growth while a growing profitability. And the formula has been very simple. First, we start by identifying a challenge or a problem that our customers face. Staying very close to our customers is part of our secret sauce. Every company says that, but we've institutionalized through frequent technology summits at our headquarters where we bring in a couple of dozen customers at a time to listen to them and to share with them our prototypes and ideas that might not even be products until 2025 or later. We also have an annual user conference. Our engineers go on ride-alongs and sit-alongs and we foster many other touch points with our customers. I cannot overstate the importance of calibrating research and development decisions off of direct customer feedback. When we develop alongside our customers, it helps us get it right on the big picture like moving towards robotics security, virtual reality, fused intelligence, for example, and also helps us get it right on the millions of small details and user experience decisions to create a delightful product for our customers. This should reassure you, our investors, that our investment decisions are sound. They are geared towards products that customers want and they've told us that they will buy and it's designed to drive growth for years to come. We also stay close to the forefront of the innovation curve. So we can identify how a technology can make things better, or fix problems entirely. This is how we were the first to evangelize cloud software to public safety in the early 2010s and why we believe we'll be first introducing generative AI tools in the 2020s. Our engineers are some of the best and brightest in technology. Like me, they are energized to go out and fix problems and they work hard at it. As a result, we end up with undeniably best-in-class product market fit. Strong relationships with our customers and employees who are motivated to partner with our customers to drive their success. Our growth today is driven by decisions we made five years ago. And while we enjoy an undeniable time advantage, while competitors are trying to catch up, we're now thinking five years ahead. We believe the R&D decisions we're making today will continue to drive growth for decades to come. And then, of course, we must execute on all fronts. So that's the formula, customer closeness, plus long-term vision, plus day-to-day execution, equals value-creation across the board, for the public, for Axon, for our employees and for our shareholders. It's a winning equation and we're excited about that decade ahead of us. Before I turn it over to Josh, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge the wake of escalating global events. These conflicts, wars, violence, and unspeakable acts, we're all seeing them today. We commiserate in the pain and suffering many people are facing around the world and because we are a globally connected company, the personal pain faced by our own employees and many of you listening to this call. Axon's mission, our mission is to protect life and we're focused on continuing to execute and grow that mission. You're up, Josh. Let me start first. The thing that I heard there was most interesting this year was customers really embracing the full ecosystem. So if I go back maybe three years ago, as we were really scaling, I think we had some customers that were saying, well, jeez, you know, I don't know how much of my tech stack. I want to put with one vendor like you guys are getting to be a big part of our tech stack and what I heard this year was pretty universally customers not saying that but saying, you know, we can't wait to deploy dispatch, for example, and these are customers who've never seen what we're doing in dispatch and we're still in the early innings there. But the feedback was, we've had such good luck when we deploy products and technology from Axon. It all just works so well and the customer services is so good. So that was a really intriguing thing to me to feel that shift in dynamic where customers were just saying, you know, we've done enough of this now and it just works so well when we go with you. We -- I had several chiefs at pretty big cities say, I would love to just be able to run my whole department on Axon because I trust you guys will deliberate and it will be both excellent and we'll give me new capabilities, you know, that maybe I have even thought of yet. So that was really a positive general sentiment. Josh, you want to... The last one, I'd want to add in. Just to go into a little microcosm in terms of the detail was. I think this was the year that VR flipped from sort of conceptually interesting to ready for prime time. You know, we decided to wait for the all-in-one headsets. We didn't -- we did not, you know, want to push out a few years ago when installing VR meant room-based sensors and more complexity. We felt waiting for the all-in-ones was going to mean you could deploy a much greater scale. Now, that meant we had to do a lot of hardware development to make our TASER weapons work in a virtual world and, you know, some of the early things we tried were spaced around hand tracking just using motion sensors and to be honest, that was -- we were sort of getting feedback from our customers. It was pretty buggy. So we bit the bullet -- bit the bullet about 18 months ago to go all in on developing specialized hardware with the integrated infrared tracking lights, They're the same that are in the native HTC or Oculus controllers. And that has just gotten phenomenal customer feedback, where, oh my gosh, this just works, it's very accurate, it's no longer getting -- sort of buggy and needs to be recalibrated. So I think that was pretty exciting in terms of the near-term stuff that I think we've just had another product sort of crossover from that early developmental product market fit phase to where now it's just dialing it in, getting more hardware launched and scaling content. Thanks. Yes, so, I would start out by saying what's resonating is our existing product suite, which has been more focused on like military policing and protecting basis. You know, this year, I think the -- I saw the light bulb click at AUSA. In previous years it felt like we were, maybe a little bit of an outsider company from, you know, from over in law enforcement that was coming into federal. This year it felt like we were home. The promotional video showing how you use live streaming cameras, counter drone, you know, TASER 10, all in an integrated way. Our vehicle-based, you know, fleet solutions, our partnership with Fusus on integrating multiple cameras from both, you know, partner agencies as well as existing agency, really resonated to where it just -- it felt like people saw what we could do in base security. What I'm really excited about for the future is, we want to get into combat operations. And, you know, you may first say, well, jeez, you know, if your mission is to protect life, why would you want to do that? Well, because I believe successful military operations in the future will be those that kill the least, right? We racked up a big body count in Vietnam, and it didn't work. We killed a lot of people in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the more people we killed, the less successful our mission was. You look at what's happening in the Middle East right now with Israel. You know, imagine if they had more precise drones and robotics that could be going into those tunnels rather than dropping 2000 pound bombs with tons of collateral damage. You know, we will stay true to our mission to protect life. And I think, look, when I wrote my book the End of Killing, I believe we were closer to the end of war than it turned out. I was tragically and catastrophically wrong. You are seeing what's happening in Ukraine. But I think, you know, I wrote, I believe, in our shareholder newsletter last year or so. Imagine if we had invested in counter-material drones that we could have provided to the Ukrainians, where those drones would go out with fully autonomous artificial intelligence, not to kill people, to avoid people, but to destroy equipment. You know, if you could have brought 150,000 Russians to have to walk home because we destroyed the treads and the barrels and the engines on their equipment, while minimizing human casualties, you know, we think about, we have plenty of lethality. We're not giving a lot of it to the Ukrainians because we're actually trying to toe the line of not over-escalating. And I believe that sort of general thought process, how do we deescalate the level of violence and death to accomplish our nation's priorities and those of other sort of civilized nations is a huge opportunity. And this year at AUSA, for the first time, I had some conversations with people in senior positions in the military and military development programs, and I got a different emotional reaction. Now that's going to be years off. But I think the message is starting to resonate. You know, no matter what the mission is, killing should always be a last resort, and we should put a lot more creativity into how we accomplish our mission while minimizing the loss of life. Totally and to speak to the timing a little bit, I think, you know, key, as you heard Josh talk about before, to our market expansion and our flywheel overall is this simple, you know, two-phase approach to every new market, which is, first, we earn the right to sell to a new class of customers by taking our existing products and tailoring them in the ways that are needed to make them resonate and have product market fit with that new customer segment while we build out that sales channel. And then once we've done that and have brought them into the fold as an existing customer segment we're strong with, then we've earned the right to go even bigger by building bespoke new products that are really tailored especially for that market segment. And that story is playing out resoundingly in federal. So over the last several years, we've made tons of investments in the background, laying pipe with things like FedRAMP Compliance, FedRAMP Moderate, then FedRAMP High, and IL4 and towards IL5, all of those sorts of things, as well as hundreds of small little adjustments to all of our core hardware and software products to make them viable and ready exactly for these federal customers. And a great example of that is the VA going nationally live with Axon Records this quarter. And then what you'll start to see over time that opens us up into more of that TAM as well in addition to selling more and more of our existing, you'll see us start to develop bespoke SKUs and product lines that are even more tailored just for federal. Hey, Josh. One thing I'd like to add there is, it's sort of fun to watch the company develop where there's some really healthy internal competition. Our software started out really as an enabler for body cameras. And I remember, we got -- it's maybe five or six years ago, there was a rallying cry, like, we need our software to stand on its own. It's best in class. And so the country of Scotland, basically their biggest move with us was not even with body cameras. It was digital evidence management for their entire ecosystem. And they're not really even using our body cameras at scale. So each area of the business, it all works better together. But we're now seeing the level of maturity across each of the subsegments to where they're winning best in class on their own. And that gives us multiple ways to try to enter any new market. Sure. Hey, look, it always helps when you have new products that people want to buy. Like, that's the underlying, you know, thing there is, you know, again, this goes back to our product team really doing a fantastic job just building new value into evidence.com with new -- with these, you know, new software features that save legitimate time every police officer shift. And so when we can keep showing that type of ROI, every conversation on a renewal or an upsell is not only, you know, a -- driven by satisfaction with what the customer already has, but it's driven by interest in what we're doing next and how they can participate in that. And so when you have that combination, we have a very, very talented customer success organization that, you know, really drives deep relationships with our customers. The -- and any, you know, a side note, any account that is managed by a customer success manager at Axon, their NPS score is 81 right now. So that's, you know, an off the charts high number when you think about the range of NPS going from negative 100 to 100. And so that just shows the type of trust these customers have built in our customer success team, our product team, our sales team, so forth. And so, you know, all those things being true, it actually is, you know, it just comes down to execution in terms of, you know, sales and account management to get these deals across the finish line. And we see ARPUs going up as a result. And then NRR, you know, is also rising as a result of that. Let me start with the AI question, and we're going to be a little cagey here. I will tell you, at IACP, I was showcasing a prototype, a functioning prototype of an AI-powered service, and it got, if not the strongest, one of the most positive, strongest reactions I've ever seen in a product. Obviously, we have a ton of data that we could be running AI on. The art of this is to figure out where can we create maximum customer value while mitigating the risks that are associated, you know, with what can go wrong in AI. And we think we found at least one very powerful use case. But I'm not going to give any more details for competitive reasons, but stay tuned. Exciting times ahead. Josh, thanks for the question. And to answer directly, no, that wasn't a big driver. Instead, it was just this connected story around digital evidence in reporting. And that we think is consistent across pretty much every customer interested in Axon Records, which is they just see this link where, hey, if you have the video and you see what happened in the video, like what effect does that have on the ability to write a police report, you know, easily in a scalable and simple way. And so, you know, going back, you know, Brian Wheeler, we've talked about from time to time in terms of his leadership of our records product and his team just continues to perform very well in that regard. And our customers are seeing the value. And then, you know, like we mentioned before, having a FedRAMP-authorized cloud RMS product just aids in the momentum there. So it's really a combination of those things all coming together. Well, let me start on this one. This is one where I was just wrong. I assumed that body cameras would obsolete in car cameras. And I believed that once body cameras became ubiquitous, there would be less reason to have cameras in a car. And that's one where just I was wrong. And what I learned was that, you know, customers who've had in car cameras want to keep that perspective, especially state highway patrols, where a lot happens in front of the vehicle, and the availability of extra battery power and the ability to put more sensors to be able to do things like license plate reading, which, you know, would be not possible given the battery constraints in the body camera. So I'm happy to have been wrong and had, you know, people who together with our customers who educated me on that, to where now we have a sizable, and I think the market leading Fleet product, and we're finding other areas, you know, in some adjacent markets, and ambulances and EMS, I think even in the military, you know, starting with vehicles that are more like military policing vehicles. But over time, the array of capability and our ability to move at sort of commercial speed to bring AI and sensor capabilities, I think there could be opportunities for us to move up the value chain from just sort of policing vehicles into other types of vehicles where we can integrate our network, all of our workflow together with our sensor development, and of course, in the future, AI running on all that data. So I don't know that I could give an exact like TAM comparison between the two, but I would say that the vehicle Fleet business is certainly here to stay, and it just -- it has different needs and requirements, and you can do more when you've got, you know, access to power and a little more space to be able to put more equipment and more powerful sensors. Go ahead, Brittany. All right, before we sign off, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank you, Andrea James. This is going to be Andrea's last quarterly earnings call with us here on Zoom. So after a fast-paced and transformative six years with Axon, leading investor relations, Strategy and Communication, AJ is going to take some time to reset and enjoy the fruits of the success that she's had and has driven here at Axon. AJ has been one of my closest personal advisors. And so as we got to the end of the last XSP and we had some conversations about life and the future, I remembered one of my favorite quotes from Ray Kurzweil, the most important decisions we make are how we spend our time. And back around 2013, when my kids were in preschool, I had the wonderful opportunity to go spend a year in Europe and walk my kids to kindergarten every day And talking with AJ about her budding and growing family, I couldn't disagree with the assessment that how she spends her time might be to take advantage of some of the success from Axon. So we talked about her doing advisory and board work, given the amazing experience she's had at Tesla and here at Axon. So I'll be keeping on speed dial. AJ, and, you know, just very personally and professionally grateful to have you a colleague and a friend and want to acknowledge your great service towards our mission. I know you've -- she's also formed relationships with so many of you and it's not fully goodbye. She'll continue to support us behind the scenes in an advisory role into at least the middle of next year to ensure a smooth transition. And we are thrilled that Erik joined us earlier this year to help -- to lead our IR efforts. He's really hit the ground running, He is really there to catch the baton from one of the greats. And having been an analyst in our industry for several years, Erik, that is before joining Axon. And with that, I want to thank all of you for joining. We're proud of our team's execution. We're confident in our profitable growth. We look forward to a strong finish to the year. I wish you all a happy and wonderful holiday season. I hope the world finds more peace and we will see you all in February."

            "content": "Thank you, Josh. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of top-line revenue growth and improving profitability in 2023. Q3 2022 was my first earnings call with Axon, and we were still talking about hitting an adjusted EBITDA dollar target. So watching the team move seamlessly the margins over-deliver and drop significantly more to the bottom line has been an exciting change that we're all proud of. I continue to be impressed each quarter by our team and the focus on operational excellence. We set hard expectations for ourselves and we exceeded them again in Q3. Our topline revenue grew 33% year-over-year and we saw adjusted EBITDA margins expand to 22.2%, which is 35% year-over-year growth. Software remains the largest driver of growth in our business with our cloud and services revenue growing 55% year-over-year. Our software business model remains a powerful growth engine. Our customers subscribe to a bundle of our products. And over time, we improved these products and delivered more new features and technology enhancements. Our strong software growth is tied to multiple drivers. We see growth from new customers, who sign new licenses and adopt feature add-ons. We also see many existing customers expanding their needs and growing with us over time. This is a result of our relentless focus on solving customer problems and driving innovation in the ecosystem as Rick discussed. You see that impact in our excellent net revenue retention rate of 122% and ARR growth of 54%. Axon cloud and services revenue is now 36% of total revenue, compared to 31% last year. We are also seeing our new hardware product launches drive growth in our business. TASER 10 grew more than 50% sequentially, representing healthy demand and our ability to scale to meet that demand. Axon Body 4 made up the majority of our body camera shipments in the quarter and drove our growth in devices along with continued strength in Fleet 3, supporting 45% annual growth in our sensors hardware business. Our third-quarter gross margin of 61.7% exceeded our expectations on a higher mix of software revenue. Relative to last year, we saw our margins mix down slightly on increased TASER 10 revenue, as well as increased revenue from sensors and professional services. We expect this impact to continue in Q4 with margins slightly below Q2 and Q3, on mix. Turning to operating expenses. We saw some leverage from both R&D and SG&A supporting expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin. We continue to invest to ensure we are positioned for a multiyear growth opportunity and to support the continued scaling of our business. As I turn to our guidance, you will note our strengthening outlook on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We are pleased to increase our outlook again. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $417 million to $420 million and fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%. Our Q4 guidance implies an increase in our full-year revenue outlook to approximately $1.55 billion or 30% growth year-over-year, which is up from our prior guidance of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion or 27% to 29% growth. Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin guidance implies a full-year adjusted EBITDA margin expectation of approximately 20.8% or $322 million. This outlook is raised from our prior expectation of approximately 20% adjusted EBITDA margin for the full-year or $302 million to $306 million. Our increased revenue guidance factors and growing demand we are seeing across our product categories, including our premium bundle offerings and the successfully executed launches of TASER 10 and Axon Body 4. For 2024 and beyond, we remain confident in our ability to scale globally to unlock new customer segments and to introduce even more new products that drive highly profitable revenue growth. And with that, I would like to open it up to questions. I think a lot of what you're seeing is, we're just coming into our fourth quarter. And so there's only one quarter left in the year. As we look at that range in terms of what we're seeing on revenue, it just doesn't give a particularly wide range as you look back at the full year. So the look at the full year looks more precise and more tight based on what we're looking at for Q4. And then in terms of, you know, what we're baking in for Q4 or what we would need to see, it's really our, you know, estimate looking at our pipeline of customer deals we think we have in the quarter. We have good momentum, as you've seen across TASER 10, across Axon Body 4. And so we're factoring those in as we look at Q4, as well as, you know, we what we think we'll be able to do from a software standpoint. So again, it's the best guess. We don't always know what perfectly, but that's what we're looking at as we look at Q4 guidance. Just to follow up with some stats, you'll see some of these in the shareholder letter, but we have pegged the TAM, our total addressable market for federal at about $10 billion. And the other exciting fact we shared this quarter is that five of the top 10 deals we booked were in our federal business. And we've given a couple of examples of where we're getting really nice traction with federal customers. So the VA has gone live on Axon Records. The Department of Homeland Security has an IDIQ for our body-worn cameras and our software. The U.S. Army is renewing its TASER modernization program, and our first TASR contract with the US Federal government agency has been signed. So we're really seeing the momentum from the customers in the deals we're doing and in the bookings and think there's a pretty large opportunity out there just from an addressable market size to everything. Rick talked to. From a modeling standpoint for all of you guys. The only thing I would add is we have historically guided you to take an average of, you know, the last six to eight quarters. And think about that as the size of the step up in that revenue. I think because of this impact that Josh talked about of more and more customers moving to our premium bundles, the size of that step will start to get bigger every quarter. It probably won't be as big as it was this quarter, though, because you are seeing some of the benefit of the Fleet 3 installations start to turn on and come into that. So while there was nothing, you know, one time this quarter, you are seeing Fleet 3 come in. But I think we're also comfortable saying that because of premium, we are going to see slightly larger steps up each quarter in software than we have historically averaged out. Yes. So I would say I think the step up in software is particularly large this quarter. So I don't think there's anything offsetting it. As you look at Q4, you know, we're putting forth pretty healthy growth year-over-year, 24% to 25%. That's on top of a Q4 quarter last year that grew about 55%. So I think it's still a very healthy guide that is taking into account the premium software piece. AB4, TASER 10, all the momentum we're seeing. Of course. Okay. Which leaves us with gross margins? So I would say gross margins were better than expected, really, on the incredibly strong software performance in the quarter. So our software business is gross margin accretive for us. And so the more we build up there, the better overall impact for our gross margin. So I would drive most of the outperformance there. As I think about, you know, why was it down, you know, still a bit year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter? That's really just on mix of our sensors business and the fact that our sensors business also performed incredibly well and the fact that our TASER 10 is also performing quite well. Our TASER margins overall improved quarter-over-quarter, but the mix in there of TASER 10 was quite high. I think a bit of both. So we're absolutely going to keep hiring. I think, first of all, our stated goal in R&D is to invest basically top-line growth back into R&D. You can hear all of the exciting things that even with what we're doing, we still feel like we can work on and we have in front of us. And so there's going to continue to be a very robust pace of hiring from an R&D standpoint. Again, we won't get ahead of our revenue growth, but we're really investing there. Then on the SG&A side, we will absolutely get leverage in SG&A, but we can't do what we need to do with flat headcount from where we are today. We do need to continue to invest. Some of that is in sales, but honestly, a lot of that is really on the G&A side as we, you know, figure out how we can get this company to support the level of top-line growth that we're delivering on. You know, better IT systems, get our material weakness remediated, do a lot of that housekeeping that hopefully we very much keep in the background and you don't see, but will overfire investment to deliver nicely on all of these opportunities in front of us. And will give you some leverage too, because we still have our 25% adjusted EBITDA margin target out there. So hopefully this year shows that we can deliver and head towards that. And you all believe us that we're going to hit that. But there is a balance to do between here and there. You know, we haven't given any commentary on how we get to that 25% between gross margins and OpEx leverage, other than to say, you know, we're obviously looking really closely at both of them. I think for as much as software is a benefit to our overall gross margins, you also see incredible success in our sensors business, and that's a drag on gross margins. I'd still take all the growth we get from there. And to your question, on Fleet, you know, right now, that's part of our $9 billion camera TAM. But I think we still feel like we've got nice penetration opportunities and good runway in front of us on Fleet still. We've talked a little bit about how we were playing catch up this year and next year will normalize a bit. But it's really some of those mixed dynamics that we're going to be working on as we balance between gross margin and OpEx leverage. I think the last thing we've been focused on is improving our overall TASER gross margins as we continue to leverage and scale TASER 10. So we've got a couple of benefits to gross margin over the next couple of years, and then we just have to balance that out with mix, if that makes sense. Of course. I was going to say it's a great question. We are working really hard to ramp our capacity, but I think you can see from some of the growth numbers and some of what we have been delivering that we're doing a nice job getting our capacity ramped up. As we continue to go into next year, what we're really working on is getting more of that capacity automated."

            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Rick. Every quarter here at Axon, leaves me more impressed with our team. As Rick highlighted, we just reported our seventh consecutive quarter with over 30% top-line growth. This kind of growth does not happen automatically. It's fueled by our ability to drive value to our customers and the momentum we have built over many years. While I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, I'll share with you a few things that keep me confident in the long term. First, I'd like to share my vision of where we will execute over the next five-plus years. We mainly sell into four key customer categories; state and local, U.S. Federal, International, and Enterprise. Each of those has a different path for how we tackle go-to-market, yet the overarching way to think about Axon is we are building the operating system for public safety and security across the board. A few years ago, we would say that we envisioned every officer carrying a TASER device or an Axon body camera and having a seat on our software network. As we built out this network, the vision, as you can see it, is expanding, so that from when -- so that from when an officer first interacts with the civilian to when a case is adjudicated, we are powering that workflow from start to finish. We have the team and the capability and we're going to continue to challenge ourselves to execute on that vision. And we remain really excited about the opportunities that we're seeing in state and local. Agencies across the United States are facing growing challenges. They're understaffed, navigating increasing training requirements and have to do one of the most difficult jobs in the world every day. This segment remains our core and we are investing and delivering solutions to help our customers. We brought two new devices to market this year, invested in productivity-enhancing software features and relaunched a disruptive VR training portfolio. When I think about our mission to protect life and look at the inefficiencies in the existing training landscape today, I think VR can be one of our most exciting long-term opportunities. We're also spinning up more customers on our records product, getting TASER 10 in the hands of early adopters and ramping shipments of Axon Body 4. Something I find particularly encouraging is our new order book for TASER 10. I've talked about my excitement here for the past few quarters and even my expectations have been exceeded. Simply put, we have found product market fit very quickly and the credit goes to Rick and our TASER pillar team led by Pat Madden for driving tremendous early results. Orders for TASER 10 after three quarters have already surpassed the first six quarters of TASER 7 orders, even as I read that boggles my mind. That means three quarters in, our TASER 10 orders are pacing at over 4 times the order rate we saw for TASER 7. What is encouraging is our top three TASER 10 orders, each came from customers outside of our core state and local base, two being international customers and one in corrections. Another customer area that has me confident in our long-term strategy is our U.S. federal business, as you just saw in the video. Our products are meeting the needs in several applications for federal customers where safety goes beyond the traditional state and localities and expands into the global footprint of our military bases where we can help protect those who have chosen to protect us. Five of our top 10 deals booked in the quarter came from federal customers, growing from a base of essentially zero a few years ago. Finally, I will talk about the traction we are seeing internationally, which grew 52% in Q3. We think international is one of the largest opportunities in front of us today and we are evangelizing the cloud, higher in country heads in new markets and spending a lot of time growing our brand and presence overseas. We've got line-of-sight into a strong close to our year and we are building pipeline to support long-term growth. It's been an incredible journey and it's easy to look back at what we've accomplished so far, but we don't spend a lot of time on that stuff at Axon. We're onto the next play. Now, I will turn it over to Brittany to go through our financials in more details. Brittany? Yes, I'd just add. I think, you know, it was an incredible combination of amazing reception around our newer products, specifically VR, TASER 10 and Axon Records. But then an equally awesome reception to kind of the early showcase products that have not hit the market yet, which gives us a lot of confidence going into the next couple of years here that the things that we will be rolling out have, you know, already, you know, the perception of really good product market fit and should have a lot of demand associated with them. Of course, we've got to do a lot on our end to execute well and to make sure we go all the way to the finish line on those products. But that's always a really exciting thing to see when what you're building resonates so clearly with our customers. Yes, I want to come back on one last thing. I don't want my comment to be misinterpreted. When we, for example, say we want to drive down police shootings, we're not passing judgment on whether police are justified or not. And similarly, with what's happening in Gaza right now, I'm not passing any judgment about the appropriateness of the use of force. The fact is, I think what the Israelis are facing right now is in order to get the military targets they're going after. Those targets are embedded deeply in civilian. They're intentionally buried in civilian epicenters. And so if you could imagine a world where a modern military could go in and put everybody to sleep and then sort out the good people from the bad people without a loss of life, that would be an amazingly important capability. Now, of course, I'm doing the imaginary end state of putting people gently to sleep. But there are steps we can begin to think about being much more precise in ways that are certainly causing less collateral damage and less lethality. And those are problems that get us really excited, because I think we're seeing today's technology puts people in unwinnable situations with catastrophic outcomes. And we think, you know, us and other technologists need to give warfighters and police and everybody better tools to be able to do the legitimate jobs that governments need to do to protect their people without such, you know, technology just requires inflicting a lot of death. Sure. Nice to see you, Will. And thanks for the question. I would say, it's -- there's a couple kind of different threads to the story here. The first one is that in our Tier 1 markets, which we talk about a lot, the U.K., Canada and Australia, those markets were just seeing wider adoption of the Axon network. So it's not only about TASERs and body cams and Dems, it's about our DEMS, DEMS add-ons, and it's about Axon Fleet and Axon Interview Room and moving toward Axon Records. So we're really excited about just the proliferation of our products into those markets that mirror the U.S. most similarly. And then we've got, you know, essentially a number of other markets that are starting to adopt one Axon product for the first time. A lot of the momentum has been on the TASER side, but more recently, we're actually starting to see some really encouraging signs in a few European markets adopting the cloud for the first time. So the growth of our international business will really be driven by continued execution in the Tier 1 markets, but starting to see more, you know, historically, you know, rest of world markets start to look a lot more like those markets where, you know, they're adopting cloud, they're adopting TASER, they're using DEMS, they value body cameras and other, you know, wearables and camera technology. And just the combination of those things is really going to provide that, you know, foundation of growth for the international business. I still believe, you know, it's very possible, you know, over the next five to seven years that our international business could be rivaling our U.S. business in terms of bookings. And, you know, once we get to that point, feel really good about the revenue catching up over time. So that's really our focus right now, Will. Sure, yes. Our Head of International Sales, named Chris Kirby, is doing a really good job managing the team toward the out-year of pipeline. So the focus has really evolved from like, hey, what can we capture this quarter, this year, to how can we do that and build a pipeline three to four times the size of the goal next year to just make sure that there's a little more consistency there. So, you know, there'll always be some lumpiness, especially in years where we feel like we've got a lot of TASER momentum because of just the nature of the revenue recognition on TASER versus, you know, the SaaS products. And so, you know, if -- you know, if large international police forces are buying TASERs, you'll see some of those kind of lumpy one-time revenue events. But over the long term, you know, I think that's -- we're already starting to see that kind of balance out and that's, you know, buoyed by a foundation of video bookings and more video adoption. Sure. Yes, We're -- Mike, we're really glad you asked that question because, you know, that's one of the things we're most proud of here to see in the results is just this, you know, excitement around the Axon cloud suite of products. And, you know, the story here has been just multiple years of investment into new features, software add-ons, new enterprise software products, just finding product market fit and being rapidly adopted by our customer base. And ultimately, you know, more and more customers are buying our premium offerings, starting with the Officer Safety Plan and then going up to the Plus version of that and then the Premium version of that. And we've seen that the last couple of years, but now it's really starting to flow through into the revenue and the results. And so, you know, just, you know, more adoption of DEMS, more adoption of software add-ons, more adoption of Records management, more adoption of our standards product. And it's really exciting to see all that come together. Talked a lot about our flywheel of this idea that really, you know, OSP is the driver of that flywheel into new products and that's exactly what we're seeing right now. So really proud of our product team for doing a great job, you know, understanding where this, you know, where this platform evidence.com can take us and listening to our customers in terms of where they see value and then doing an incredible job building those products. And our sales team is doing a great job selling them on the back end. So things are aligning really, really nicely in the cloud business and we're really excited about it. Sure, I'd say within the federal government, there's certainly a network effect there. No question. You know, once we've started with being FedRAMP authorized, that was kind of a big breakthrough for us. And then, you know, Impact level 5, et cetera, just all the kind of table stakes, clearances that our products needed to achieve. And then, you know, once, you know, the Customs and Border Protection has been a really great customer of ours. We heavily value that relationship. And having a lot of momentum there has just kind of permeated out into other branches of the federal civilian space. Rick talked about the opportunity in the military as well. I think there is something there to leveraging our success federally into other international governments. That's happening a little bit here and there, but there is potential that that could accelerate. So, yes, I'm really pleased to see, you know, the types of network effects we've seen in the federal space. There are two other things, I would add. One is just the customer relationship, namely, as they deployed our evidence.com and our other products, they just had a great experience that they shared with us was just different than they had with previous technology. So that set us up for the win. Then the other piece I would say is, we made a decision years ago when we are building records that we were not going to go try to win in RFPs for Record systems because we believe that's a recipe for building bad software. If you go build, you know, 800 checkboxes that all the great on the paper report you submit for the RFP, you're going to build a lot of breadth and there's almost no reward for good user experience. And we structured a lot of our go-to-market around how do we win in the hands of the user and set this up where we can build great software that does the most important things really, really, really well and then integrate other systems to handle sort of the fringes and the breadth of it. And I think that was a, you know, pretty important here where what we were able to show them was a functional system that they could test out and go, wow, this just works great in the hands of the user because we spent the time to build it that way, you know, bringing in people with consumer backgrounds that are used to building UI. That's got to be super intuitive, not built to a large government spec document. No offense to government, you know, procurement specifications, but there's a reason government spec software is typically not great, and that's because, you know, you're building it to very large specs. And in there, there's typically not a real easy way to quantify the user experience. And we focus on user experience first and then identifying which of those specs are the really important ones to the people actually using it. And I think that philosophy, we did not expect to win a federal agency this early in Records lifecycle. So it was a really pleasant surprise. And of course, world-class tech recruiting requires world-class tech recruiters. So that's also part of that fun picture."

        "content": "Andrea James: Okay. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Thanks for joining our executives on the call. A quick note about the faces you're going to see on the call today. We want to welcome Erik Lapinski to the team at Axon. He joined us earlier this year and he's our Director of Investor Relations and Financial Communications and we're thrilled to have him. And just Angel Ambrosio, I just want to say, we want to thank her so much. She's been on these calls for over 3 years and she's really helped to lead the way in making us Zoom-first on our earnings call. She's also helped us lead the way in ESG reporting. Angel is not going anywhere. We still work together side-by-side every day. Okay; on to business. I hope you've all had a chance to read our shareholder letter which was released after the market closed. You can find it at investor.axon.com. And our prepared remarks today are meant to build upon that very robust shareholder letter. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made today are pursuant to and within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today and are not guarantees of future performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and we discuss these risks in our SEC filings. And before we turn it over to Rick, we will play our video which is under 4 minutes today.\nPatrick Smith: All right. Great job, Andrea and Angel and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. It's great to be coming back to you with another excellent quarter and an even brighter outlook. I'm fortunate to spend most of my time talking to customers. Reception to our new products has been fantastic. Recently, I met with police chiefs who said, once their officers take TASER 10 out in the field, they will not go out again without it. After trials and successful de-escalations in the field, some have even joked that their officers are saying, you'd have to pry my TASER 10 from my cold dead fingers. This is the type of feedback that motivates us and keeps us moving forward. Axon Body 4 began shipping in June and we're also getting a great response. Later, you will hear from Brittany, who we recently promoted to Chief Operating Officer in addition to her role as CFO. Bringing these two roles together under Brittany sets us up for our next phase of operational excellence. As COO and CFO, Brittany will oversee our margin profile from end to end to ensure we execute on our ambition to deliver profitable growth for many years to come. Brittany has been a star addition to our team. She brings operational rigor, foresight, stewardship and candor. We also promoted Josh Isner who previously served as our CRO, then COO and is now President. Josh has been an instrumental leader at Axon for more than a decade. And during his tenure, he and I have worked side-by-side evolving and growing the company. I have given Josh many challenges over the years and he's never failed to exceed my expectations. As President, Josh will continue to oversee day-to-day operations while taking on an expanded role within the executive team and with our Board members. Expanding responsibilities for my team allows me to focus on what inspires me: our products and our customers. Product development will always be a key part of my job description. For years, you've heard me talk about my sometimes-futuristic views of what the market needs. And for years, we have successfully innovated. So what's around the corner? I'll touch on 2 key areas: robotic security and generative AI. In June, we acquired Sky-Hero which builds upon our strategy for robotic security and is highly synergistic with our product road map. Sky-Hero gives us a leading indoor tactical drone solution that complements our existing Axon Air strategy. While the acquisition will not be a meaningful revenue contributor this year, it fits into our long-term vision. We want to make the world a safer place and avoid situations where we have to send people through the door into highly dangerous, even deadly situations. Sky-Hero is already selling to U.S. federal government customers and SWAT teams in the U.S. and all across Europe who give very strong feedback about the value, durability, usability and reliability of their technology. Sky-Hero is based in Belgium and unlocks many new customer relationships across Europe. I was especially impressed with CEO, Yves and his team which is small and scrappy and they really move fast. They're going to fit in great here at Axon. And finally, here's how we're thinking about generative AI and large language models. Like we've already been doing with traditional AI, we will use these newer technologies to create game-changing products for our law enforcement customers. Several years ago, we published a video on the future of policing. This video features scenes where a police officer was able to feed their body camera video into an AI system which then created a draft report, auto populated of the details in the audio/video record. The point is, we were talking about generative AI before it really even existed in a usable form. Now I'm not sharing this for bragging rights but what it means for you is that we don't have to pivot our strategy because our strategy has anticipated this future reality for years. We spend a lot of our time and I spend most of my mental energy studying key technology trends and then mapping those trends against customer needs. We don't wait for the customer to ask for it. We don't even wait for the technology to exist. We map evolving technologies that we believe will mature in the coming years against existing customer pain points and then we invest early, so our ecosystem will be ready to catch the ball when the underlying technology matures. This is precisely what is happening now with large language models and with broader generative AI. Our mission-driven philosophy to leverage exponential technologies to solve the problems we care about is the core to our value creation engine. An investment in Axon is investing in the future of AI and it has been for several years. The flywheel for AI technologies, including LLMs, is powered by signals and data. We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars into building out an ecosystem of wearable cameras and sensors and the world's leading cloud platform that securely hosts the enormous data generated by this expansive ecosystem. Everything we have built over the past decade has been in a -- position us to be able to safely and ethically and securely collect, share and analyze that data for our customers, paving the way for public safety adoption of ever more advanced AI tools. These tools will build upon and expand the AI applications that are already a critical component of the Axon ecosystem. And just like we evangelized and we're the first to bring cloud software at scale to public safety, we think Axon will lead the way and bring advanced AI designed with thoughtful, ethical controls at scale to public safety. We're already seeing really promising results from our early work here and we're just getting started. You're up, Josh.\nJoshua Isner: Thanks a lot, Rick. It's been an honor and a privilege to build my career at Axon. I care deeply about our mission, our customers and our team and I'm proud to help lead an organization that is unapologetic about winning. This team just blocks out the noise and executes and you can see that in our results. As Rick reflected, we are getting great feedback from customers about TASER 10 and Axon Body 4 and I'm especially pleased that this feedback is translating into orders. We closed the first half with strong orders and we expect a greater increase into the second half as we convert more of our new product pipeline. This drove our confidence in increasing our guidance which Brittany will take you through in a moment. In Q2, we continue to execute on our 2023 focus areas: revenue, profitability, new market expansion and new product adoption. We just finished our sixth consecutive quarter with revenue growth above 30%. This kind of growth doesn't just happen. It's a combination of having the right products, the right sales strategy and the right team to execute on an enormous market opportunity. And our relationships with our customers are truly deep. We don't just look for a transactional share or sale. We partner with our customers and make sure they are successful and they keep coming back to us so we can help them solve more problems. Our cloud business grew 62% year-over-year. And we are in the early days of expansion into new markets and products. Our software penetration remains low and we are finding ways to sell more software content into our installed base, executing against a $22 billion software TAM. Our TASER business grew 14% year-over-year and TASER 7 remains the greatest contributor for now and we are pleased to see incremental growth driven by early shipments of TASER 10. We are just getting started with that weapon and it's a game changer and we think it will drive TASER growth over the next several years. Profitability is our second operational focus and is critical to ensuring we have a sustainable business model to drive the next decade of our growth strategy. I am pleased with our team's focus and execution in Q2 as we stabilized gross margin through 2 of our largest product launches in company history, while growing our team at the same time. Third, our new market bookings grew ahead of revenue in Q2. We are seeing continued success in the federal market with first-half bookings up nearly triple digits year-over-year. And in justice, we have triple-digit bookings growth year-to-date. 4 of our 10 largest deals in the quarter came from new and emerging markets, a sign of continued diversification. Finally, new product adoption is critical to our success. We are gaining traction and we've seen emerging product bookings grow nearly 50% year-over-year. ALPR, auto tagging, Axon Records and Axon Respond, are a few key callouts here. We closed an incredible first half to the year and the outlook for our second half looks very solid. We are on to the next play. And with that, we'll turn it over to Brittany to go through the operations and financials in more detail. Brittany?\nBrittany Bagley: Thank you, Josh. And thank you, Rick, for the kind words. I'm very excited to take on more of the business and to continue driving the next stage of operational excellence at this fantastic company. Turning to the results. We reported another strong quarter, reflecting broad strength across our business. Our top line grew 31% year-over-year and we saw EBITDA margins of 22%. Second quarter gross margin of 62% improved sequentially, primarily reflecting business mix from software. As you saw in our shareholder letter, we did have some noise in our segment margins this quarter as we worked to more closely align our overhead costs with our specific product lines and had some onetime adjustments. On an aggregated basis, however, most of that is allocations between segments and our overall gross margins reflect a mix benefit from software. Axon Cloud and services revenue made up 35% of total revenue this quarter compared with 29% a year ago. As we noted last quarter, we would expect full year gross margin to remain approximately flat or improve modestly from Q1 2023 levels due to continued professional services related to Fleet 3 and the continuing ramp of Axon Body 4 and TASER 10. We continue to believe there are opportunities next year and over the long term to improve our margin profile as we invest in automation and recognize scale efficiencies from recent product launches. We also expect to continue to see mix benefits from our software growth. We believe we will exit this year at a more normalized run rate demand for our Fleet product, having largely caught up on our backlog. Turning to our operating expenses. We saw leverage out of both R&D and SG&A. We continue to invest absolute dollars to drive our product road map and to scale our business rapidly. We're pleased with the adjusted EBITDA margin of 22% in the quarter but given the second half gross margin profile and timing of some OpEx investments, continue to keep our guidance at 20% for the year. With our increase in revenue, this does result in us dropping more to the bottom line for the year and we're continuing to focus on how we can better leverage our OpEx, especially in SG&A over the longer term. Turning to our guidance. We are increasing our full year revenue outlook to a range of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion, representing about 27% to 29% growth. We continue to target full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% which implies an increased range of $302 million to $306 million of adjusted EBITDA. In terms of the healthy guidance increase, we always want to make sure we can deliver on what we say we are going to do. And that continues to be our focus while at the same time, making sure we're doing our best to accurately reflect what we're seeing in the business. We had 2 major hardware product launches this year and the successful rollout of these products as well as the robust customer response to these launches has given us the confidence to increase our forecast after a strong first half of the year. We do expect most of the increase relative to our prior forecast to occur in the fourth quarter due to typical seasonality. With that, I would like to open it up to questions.\nA - Andrea James: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Will Power at Baird.\nWilliam Power: Well, I guess, first, congratulations on the strong results and congratulations, Josh and Brittany, on your promotions. That's great to see. Maybe, I guess, 2 questions. I guess, first, I'd love to kind of dig into the cloud success. I mean really strong growth there, over 60%. I think in the shareholder letter, you said about 50% of the growth was driven by body cameras. And so I want to just get a perspective of how you think about the continued opportunity just looking at that piece of it. Then the other -- second part of that question is what are the other key drivers within cloud right now? Because it's clear you're having a lot of growth outside of just that body camera piece.\nJoshua Isner: Yes. Thanks a lot, Will. And it's good to see you and thanks again for having us at your conference in June. I'd say in terms of just growing cloud adoption for us, there's really two elements of it. Number one is making sure that we continue to proliferate kind of hardware in as many different forms as we can that plug into our cloud ecosystem. So the more body cameras we sell into our existing core market but also into international, federal and enterprise, obviously, that will drive more usage of Evidence.com. And likewise, the more enterprise software licenses we sell for things like records management, computer-aided dispatch, our justice product, Axon Air licenses, just the more software-only licenses that we continue to roll up here that will continue to provide favorable results as well in our cloud business. So it's really about doing those -- both of those things really well at the same time and the team has done a really nice job of that so far this year.\nWilliam Power: And if I can just fit in just a second question. You raised guidance pretty significantly for the year. Anything else you can add with respect to the visibility in the second half and particularly the fourth quarter, given the seasonality that I think Brittany just alluded to, too, just to provide investors confidence in that increase?\nBrittany Bagley: It's a great question. Thank you, Will. I think part of it goes down to -- comes down to what we see in our business. And I think we were very careful as we came into the year not to get ahead of ourselves in terms of what we were expecting for AB4 and TASER 10, given that those were 2 big launches for us. But we have seen, as Rick and Josh both commented, just wonderful customer reception to those products. And so we have good visibility, both in terms of what we can ramp up from a manufacturing standpoint that gives us confidence in the volume of those products that we'll have available. And then I would say you couple what we have available from an operational standpoint with what we're seeing from the customers and we think we have pretty good visibility in terms of delivering in the second half of the year. I think, as I said, we're partway through Q3 right now and so we can call out that we think some of that will be in Q4, especially as we ramp into AB4 and see the timing of some of the contracts that we have coming in and some of the deals we have in the pipeline with customers. And then I think the other thing is just our cloud and services revenue. As you can see, it's done very nicely this year. And that is just a very reliable recurring software business that we can bank on every quarter. And we look at that as we go through the second half of the year, combined with the TASER 10 and AB4 products and that's what gives us confidence in that guidance.\nAndrea James: Okay. Next question from Tim Long at Barclays.\nTimothy Long: Two, if I could. First, on the gross margin side, Brittany. Could you talk -- you talked about a lot of the moving parts here but maybe if you could just touch on 2 aspects, where we are and how we're feeling about the ramp of the 2 new products and impact on gross margin as we go through the year. And I noticed -- I think Axon Cloud might have been one of those areas where there were some adjustments. It looks like the margin went down there a little bit. Can you just talk about as that business scales, what we should expect for gross margins? And then I had a follow-up after that.\nBrittany Bagley: Yes, of course. So there's a lot of moving pieces in our gross margin, as you can tell, from going through our shareholder letter. I think the biggest thing is we have had some headwinds on gross margin this year, really from 3 main pieces. One, getting TASER 10 ready to go, ready to ramp, ready to be scaled in production. And we expect -- we continue to ramp and scale that business as we go through the year but that's really a next-year event when we think that that's fully scaled and ramped up. So factored into our gross margins this year but should be a gross margin benefit for next year. I think it's similar on the launch of AB4. There's just a period of time while we go through a transition of bringing a new product up and getting it ready to get launched that again, weighing a bit on this year should be nice for us next year. And then probably the last piece that we talked about last quarter, it's continuing to impact the cloud and services gross margin which you noted for this quarter, is just the professional services on our Fleet installations. So our Fleet has been a phenomenal product for us this year. Some of that was because we were inventory-constrained and had some backlog coming into this year and we've really been working through that. But with Fleet, we sell the hardware. We have professional services to install the hardware. That is a bit of a hit to gross margin for us in a onetime way. And then we turn on software associated with the Fleet product. And so once we're through the professional services install, we have nice recurring software revenue attached to the Fleet camera. But our volumes of Fleet are so high this year, you can view that as a bit of an investment in gross margin to unlock nice long-term software revenue sort of next year and beyond.\nTimothy Long: And then just a quick one for Josh. You mentioned a lot of the -- some of the larger deals were in newer areas like federal and international. Could you just give us a little flavor of what -- examples of what type of deals those are? And how sustainable you think the moves into these new geographies and regions would be?\nJoshua Isner: Yes, great question and thank you. First of all, one that we're really excited about is a deal in our justice segment. So here, we're talking about prosecutors buying kind of enterprise licenses for Evidence.com and tightly integrating with the police departments. And so that was 1 of the 4. A couple were federal. And certainly, we continue to see those become more common and at larger dollar amounts as well which are both very encouraging signs and speaks to all the great work Richard Coleman and his team are doing in our federal business. And then lastly, in international. In our Tier 1 markets, the U.K., Canada and Australia, we still see very meaningful orders coming out of those markets, both across TASER and body cams and Evidence.com. And then we continue to start to make more headway in some of these large markets outside of those 3. And generally, at those -- at this point, those have been more taser-oriented orders as we continue to evangelize the cloud and work with our early kind of opportunities on getting some of these major customers on to the cloud. So that's a little bit of background around where some of those are coming from.\nPatrick Smith: Josh, if I could add in a little bit as well. Just very rough, if we look at the long term, right now, international is about 1/5 of our business. At scale, international -- I mean, the U.S. should be about 1/5 of our business. The rest of the world is at least 5x larger than the U.S. market is. And so as we -- we're very focused on opening these markets but police face similar challenges around the world. Now there's one unique thing about the United States and that is the gun culture of the public that is quite different from the challenges other countries face. And in some ways, that makes TASER 10 even more transformative in every other country around the world because I think what we've generally seen is U.S. police will carry a gun and a taser. We've seen that less likely to be something that our international customers would do. But if you're a police officer in a country where the public doesn't really have firearms, a TASER 10 could actually become the primary defensive weapon in those markets because, frankly, if you are, for example, a French police officer and you need a firearm, chances are it's not petty criminals with a gun. You might be dealing with some sort of terrorist event where a pistol is probably not the right tool anyway. And so I believe T10 actually is the biggest game changer in those international markets to give us beachheads where we could really begin to expand the growth because, again, long term, we need to succeed as a truly global company. And when we do that, these international markets should frankly dwarf our U.S. market.\nAndrea James: Josh Reilly at Needham. Go ahead, Josh.\nJosh Reilly: Great job on the quarter here team. What are you seeing in terms of customers who are interested in getting new tasers and body cams and that were going to buy the AB3 maybe and the TASER 7 but now that you switched to the new models and these are released. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of customers in this category? And did it have any impact on the Q2 revenue results? Would it have been even higher with some customers switching around? And is that impacting the Q4 commentary around revenue as well?\nJoshua Isner: Yes, Josh, thank you for the great question. A couple of ways to think about this. So coming out of the first half of the year, as everyone remembers, we're a little more conservative on what our guidance would look like for that reason because there's this period when you launch new products where you don't know if customers are going to want to just continue with what they have or trial the new product before buying it or just switch right over to the new product. And so I think we've kind of cleared out a lot of those uncertainties at this point. And I think it's fair to say that a lot of the interest has converted from TASER 7 to TASER 10. And so customers that were on order for TASER 7 kind of pumped the brakes, wanted to trial TASER 10 and now we're moving in that direction. AB4 is a separate -- a little bit of a separate motion because the early volumes of those cameras are driven by hardware upgrades in our TASER Assurance Plan, not as much book and ship like right out of the gate. And so 2 kind of slightly different stories there. But yes, as those things become better in focus, it allows us to get a little more aggressive with our guidance. And as the year comes together and that, combined with a really solid back-half pipeline, gives us a lot of confidence moving into the last 2 quarters of the year here.\nBrittany Bagley: I'm going to throw in a little bit of extra color for you on that. Our TASER 7 was pretty stable in this quarter. So there's certainly a dynamic of customers getting very excited about TASER 10 but we're still seeing very nice support and volume from TASER 7. I would think about a lot of the growth in the taser segment this quarter coming from TASER 10 starting to ramp up and get into customers. And then I would say similarly on our cameras, we didn't see significant growth in our camera business in Q2 and that really was because as we go do those refreshes, we're going to let customers who want to refresh on AB4, refresh on AB4. We just started shipping AB4. And so again, you'll see some of that be stronger in the second half of the year.\nJosh Reilly: And then just a follow-up on the Fleet 3. You mentioned you're going to catch up on demand by year-end. How much of the catch-up is around manufacturing the hardware versus actually getting the product installed at the end vehicle? Where has the greater bottleneck been in the last couple of quarters here?\nBrittany Bagley: Yes. I would say it's shifting, I would say the greater bottleneck coming out of '22 was probably on the hardware, on the actual inventory side. And now we've done a nice job catching up on that and really the bottleneck now, it's not a bottleneck because we're ramping up to get it to customers. But the gating item is really more around the installations.\nAndrea James: Mike Ng at Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, Mike.\nMichael Ng: I just have two. So Axon Cloud and services revenue was up substantially, outpacing the Sensors and other segment revenue growth. I was just wondering if you could just answer a couple of questions to help reconcile the differences in revenue there. First, you said you're selling more software content into the installed base. So that -- is that customers just upgrading their plans but using existing equipment? Does that give you higher confidence about an equipment upgrade? And then are there other pieces of software that you would call out that are doing particularly well? I know, Josh, you flagged a few.\nJoshua Isner: Yes. Ultimately for us and we've talked a little about this in the past but the big kind of focus for our sales team is selling our Officer Safety Plans which have a number of different software features in across DEMS and Records and Standards, product which is kind of a use-of-force tracking product. So there's a lot in those plans. And ultimately, the more of those bundles we sell, the higher our ARPU will be in software. And then when we combine that with kind of picking up momentum, both on the records management side and in the justice segment and then in some of our new markets, those things combined to offer a nice uplift over just kind of our base Evidence.com licensing. And so it's really a combination of those 2 things.\nBrittany Bagley: I would just -- I would add, 100% agree, everything Josh said is spot on. I mean we are seeing very healthy demand for our premium bundles and that's driving our strong net revenue retention. It's driving growth in the software business, the domestic E.com, Evidence.com licenses drove the largest sequential increase. I think the other thing I would note for this quarter is we were able to start recognizing revenue for our Standards product now that we have it in general availability. And so that helped make the step up slightly larger this quarter than it has been in some other quarters. And so we spend a lot of time talking about how big is the size of the step. It was definitely larger this quarter and we continue to look at it more as an average of quarters over time. It was slightly smaller in Q1. It was big in Q4. It's big this quarter. So it's been lumpy as we've had some of these revenue recognition pieces come together. But overall, the domestic Evidence.com business is driving the bulk of that and thus why you're seeing such nice healthy growth in that segment.\nMichael Ng: And I did want to follow up on that along with the comment that Josh made earlier about good momentum in justice. So is it right to interpret that there are customers that are buying the software or the E.com licenses that may not necessarily be part of the body camera or the TASER installed base? And if that's the case, I was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit more and talk about the opportunity there?\nPatrick Smith: Let me jump in over Josh. I'm excited on this one. Like, for example, the country of Scotland selected us for their digital evidence management system across police, prosecutor's courts, the whole country and they are not using our body cameras. We've had some similar albeit -- I'm not sure which ones we've specifically disclosed or not but we've had other international agencies move software first. And that's something that we're really proud of. And obviously, our software teams take great pride in that as well that 10 years ago, our software was basically an enabler of our hardware. And now they're both strong on their own and our software products, especially things like Records can stand on their own, although some of the generative AI stuff I alluded to in my comments, are a true game changer. When an agency is using our body cameras and our cloud software, our ability to unlock all the valuable data that's given in those audio, video records for our customers is pretty awesome. And so we think we are very well positioned and we look forward to coming back with more details. Don't want to get out over my skis but we have been doing some -- we're always inventing and prototyping with our customers and we're just hearing really positive feedback on things that we've not even announced yet. So that growth engine of doing the hardware and the software enables us to do things that you can't do -- if you can't do both those things together.\nJoshua Isner: And I totally agree with Rick and the only thing I'd add on that is there are extra licenses every agency buys for non-sworn personnel and that number will only go up with Axon Records. And so that's a big piece of the puzzle here as you think about the police officers on the street choosing our body cameras and tasers but then all of the people in the back office that need access to records and evidence, that's a substantial uplift as well. So in addition to some of the new market and kind of DEMS-only features that Rick talked about, there's an element of just our domestic customers adding on more and more as our product portfolio grows.\nJeffrey Kunins: Right, I think like you've heard us say so many times before, the power of that entire ecosystem distributed through this hardware plus software OSP and bundle philosophy is -- it is our Amazon Prime. It is our flavor of this opportunity that just inherently drives increased adoption and as customers get value out of one basket, it inherently motivates them to keep going up to higher and higher tiers and then to use more and more of what feels free to them because it's already in the basket that they have paid for and have access to. And to come back to connect that to one of the questions about federal and justice before, that's also the leverage of our R&D philosophy and approach at work where if you take something like DEMS that's had a decade of R&D investment in us to bring it to where it is, to be fit for purpose broadly for domestic and international law enforcement, it's a relatively light lift but to tailor that with a surgical part of our team to make it fit for purpose for the next adjacent market segments like prosecutors and justice, like things in the federal government and that instantly or relatively quickly unlocks whole new segments building on the back of R&D we've done before. And then once we've done that and we have momentum with federal customers in justice, it earns us the right to then start building bespoke products directly for those market segments. And that kind of successive laddering up from each angle is fundamental to our flywheel.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Mike. And before we move on, we've used the term DEMS a couple of times. That means digital evidence management system. So that's the acronym for everybody. Keith Housum at Northcoast.\nKeith Housum: Rick, with the promotions for Josh and Brittany, how is your role evolving at Rick -- at the organization?\nPatrick Smith: So it's actually not changing a ton. Over the past 5 to 6 years, I've been wanting to put more and more focus on customers and technology, really creating -- understanding the pain of our customers, conveying the story that is our existing ecosystem and writing the story for the next 10 years. And focusing on that requires just frankly a very different mental outlook than running a business day to day. So if I went back 5 or 10 years ago, to be honest, I was getting quite burned out. It's just very difficult to run a large organization and then go, oh, in between this endless e-mail inbox and all the to dos of managing the business, let me now pause and shift to creatively looking at understanding what does the next phase look like. And so I think these promotions just sort of clarify those roles and this is giving basically Brittany more control over the operational excellence of our margins and our -- everything in the manufacturing supply chain to really make sure we're delivering. It's giving Josh -- he's actually taking a little bit more of -- some of, for example, my interactions with the Board that are more operational in terms -- Josh actually tends to lead most of the Board meetings in terms of the agendas, et cetera. And what that allows me to do is focus less on what we're doing and much more engaging -- so during Board meetings, for example, I'm very focused on driving discussions at a highly strategic level. And I think we play to each other's strengths. So my wife will tell you, I'm working harder than ever and I'm traveling more than ever out with customers and large expos because I don't have a list of to dos I've got to do around internally in the office. And I know we've got a team and I've got a very long relationship with Josh and with Brittany so only having been here little over a year, I think now, we've rapidly developed that same connective tissue, where we kind of understand each other's strengths. And that allows me to focus on the thing that I'm uniquely able to do as a founder CEO and that is -- as I mentioned in my script but I just want to really call attention to it. The reason I think founder-led companies outperform and the academic data kind of shows that, is when we focus on what -- like what is the next big leg that is not obvious, like, a traditional large business. Most of our competitors are focusing on basically running up kind of a profit-driven machine and each product manager is sort of asking the customers kind of what they want. My job is to predict what the customers aren't asking for yet and to match that up to various technologies. And there's a fair amount of risk that comes with that but the rewards are significant and we saw that when we created the taser market, the body cam market, the cloud market. No customers were productively asking for those. I think we're ahead of the ball on AI. We think about overall how we communicate. When I was a child in 19 -- in the early '70s, I communicated with a rotary dial phone in my house and police had push-to-talk walkie talkies. Today, I don't have a rotary phone, like we're doing Zoom with people around the world and our customers' primary mechanism of communicating is still push-to-talk walkie talkies. Like I think in the next 10 years, that will no longer be their primary method of communication. Police will be using audio, video sensors and AI to manage the massive amount of data flow so that we're collecting what is happening in the field, distributing that information to the right people and then cycling back to that officer in the field in a very focused way the information they need to know through the media that is most efficient for them to do it. It's least distracting while they're doing this difficult job. So it's solving those sort of problems. And frankly, Jeff has done such an amazing job of building an amazing team. So when I talk about solving that problem, we've got people like Ron McCatty [ph], who built Alexa drop-in, calling that revolutionized personal communications for 100 million people, including me, right, probably far more than that now so I could talk to my mom when she was -- had mental dementia and couldn't answer a phone and my kids could drop in on her from our kitchen, that sort of disruptive communication experience is part of what we're looking at now in the next 10 years. So that's where I spend my time and that's why I'm not answering many questions about margin and budget because I've got a strong team that I know is all over that, so I can focus on the future.\nKeith Housum: Now back into more details, I'll go to Brittany and Josh. As you look at the T10 in terms of the adoption rate of that compared to the T7 as like the leading device that now people use for a taser, do you guys expecting acceleration of movement toward T10 versus like the T7? And then what does that do in terms of the mix and the margins?\nJoshua Isner: Maybe I'll talk about a little bit of the demand and I'll hand it over to Brittany to talk about the mix and margins. In terms of demand, yes, we absolutely see customers and I've said this maybe in the last call and to others as well, like this is the first product where our customers have a genuine interest in upgrading early to it. Usually, because there's a training uplift and there's challenges around deploying it across thousands and thousands of users, you kind of kick the can down the road to the end of your useful life before you upgrade to the next one because it's a lot to bite off to deploy a new taser. In this case, agencies are willing to accelerate that process in favor of getting this weapon on the streets faster. And so the early feedback continues to be very strong. Customers that -- there were even some customers who didn't move to T7 from X2 who are now jumping straight to T10 with the 10 shots and increased distance. So very, very bullish on T10 adoption over the next a couple of years here. Now keep in mind, internationally and in some domestic markets as well, there's still a trial period that takes place where agencies want to field it and get enough data. And so it doesn't happen all at once. But I think over the next couple of years, our TASER business will continue to grow on the back of more TASER 10 handles in the field.\nBrittany Bagley: I would just add, Keith, that I think because the demand has been so strong from an operational perspective, we can build in what we know we can manufacture. We really are still ramping that up. And so for the rest of this year, we've got a pretty good sense of how many handles we can actually make. And given the demands out there, that's what we can factor into our model. It is taking us some time to get it fully ramped up and scaled from a manufacturing standpoint. Next year, I think not only will we have more scaled manufacturing but we will have been able to invest in some of the automation for both the handle and the cartridges to help get the initial cost down and improve that gross margin.\nAndrea James: We have 3 analysts that we will get to next. Samik Chatterjee at JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hopefully 2 quick ones here. The Fleet systems revenue sequential ramp that you had this quarter, at least looks more modest than what you had going into 1Q. And given some of the guidance around gross margin that you had, I'm just wondering, should we be taking that as an implication that you expect Fleet systems revenue acceleration here on a sequential basis to sort of increase? And I think on the last earnings call, you had mentioned something about supply sort of constraints now getting sort of easier to ship those products. How should we think about underlying demand if you were sort of looking at a more normalized demand environment without any supply constraints? And I have a quick follow-up, sorry.\nBrittany Bagley: I think we're largely getting through our inventory supply constraints. And now we're really looking at what it will take to get Fleet installed. And so as you go through this year, you'll see basically what is normalized healthy run rate for Fleet from a demand standpoint. Remember, as I said earlier on this call, we have 3 pieces of Fleet revenue. You have the hardware which is showing up in the Fleet line item of our reporting. So you've got the hardware. You have the professional services which goes into our services line item. And then you have the software revenue that gets turned on once we have it installed. So as we come out of this year, you'll see a really nice level of run rate demand. And I would expect as we get through this year, we're at a good level of run rate demand for professional services installations as well on that Fleet product. Josh, did you want to jump in?\nJoshua Isner: Yes. I just wanted to say, I wouldn't get too caught up in the kind of sequential trends because they can vary a little depending on when we ship especially large orders. And so for us, we're really focused on that. As we said, we've grown 30% for 6 straight quarters. That's really what we try to look at is our yearly CAGR and focus on that. And there might be a little noise quarter-to-quarter on how that looks. But over the course of the year, it seems to kind of normalize.\nSamik Chatterjee: On the Evidence and cloud services growth, obviously, very robust growth that you're experiencing there. Can you talk to what the underlying customer count sort of trends are? Because I'm trying to sort of parse out how much of this is land and expand with customers that are already using and sort of upselling to them versus actually going into new customers and them trying out the product? Like can you talk about sort of the underlying customer count a bit more?\nJoshua Isner: Yes. I don't know that we're prepared to give any specifics on that today. But I would say kind of with a broader brush, we try to do 2 things really well at the same time. We try to sell new products to our existing customers and we try to sell existing products to new customers. And if we do both of those well, meaning like in our core U.S. market, it's really about selling all those new products like VR, some of the software packages and features I mentioned, computer-aided dispatch, et cetera. And then internationally, in corrections, in justice and our federal business, it's more about selling our kind of core products, tasers, body cams, DEMS, into those to create kind of that opportunity to land and expand. And so ultimately, we look at both of those metrics, new product sales and new market sales every quarter. And really happy to say that we're trending very nicely on each of those -- in each of those categories right now.\nBrittany Bagley: The only thing we do give and we gave it in our shareholder letter, is that the penetration rate of our Officer Safety Plan is less than 20% relative to our potential state and local law enforcement installed base. So I think we have both great ability to land as well as expand, to Josh's point.\nAndrea James: Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Congrats on the strong results. I did want to maybe get a little bit of additional color on AB4 and what your customers are most excited about in terms of new use cases around the AB4 capabilities?\nJoshua Isner: Maybe I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Jeff and Rick. I think ultimately, there's some incremental improvements in there around battery and optics and so forth. But really launching the 2-way voice as part of AB4. We're most excited that it actually fits a need in the market right now and that customers have a variety of use cases where the value relative to the radio, of being able to see something playing out for the dispatcher or for a mental health expert or for a translator, watching the screen and being able to communicate through the body camera with a community member, that is something that our customers are very excited about and we're seeing more and more adoption of that feature set early on. So I think that's one of the key differentiators. It's also nice to bring back our POV functionality. We haven't really launched anything new there since Flex 2. And now just a simple attachment to the body camera instead of a whole new product in SKU makes that a lot more easily adopted and tailored to certain use cases and just flexible overall for our customers.\nJeffrey Kunins: That's right. I mean I think just echoing on all of what Josh said. This is a category where the meat and potatoes matters a lot and there's tons of exciting innovation. The -- no one -- everyone always wants more battery life and we're delivering there, bringing -- turning the POV from a separate product to a no-compromise simple accessory that's an add-on, we think is a game changer for a lot of agencies. And then full circle back to Respond and really moving live streaming in this future of modern multimodal communications from a thing that feels like an add-on to a thing that feels central and native to the product itself. And 2 very specific aspects that we think resonate and the customers are telling us loud and clear they love. One is frankly, the notion of it being hands-free. The fact that not only do you have 2-way voice but I'm there in the middle of a scene having hard things go on and I can, in a hands-free way, both talk back to who's talking to me while I'm hearing. And so that enables just a new kind of freedom and interaction that complements and adds to the other communication options they have available to them today. And number two, this idea of the watch me button, you've heard us say it but from a psychology standpoint, one of the things that has been an opportunity for agencies to think about how they'll adopt live streaming is simply who is starting it. And psychologically for an officer, there's something incredibly compelling about the notion that I'm the one who gets to say, I'm asking for help. I want someone to watch my back as opposed to, I don't know when someone might choose to drop in on me. They're both critically important but the psychology of empowering officers to say I want someone to watch to my back right now. We are hearing loud and clear that they're super excited about.\nPatrick Smith: So one last thing, I'll jump in on. When we designed AB3 a number of years ago, we had -- we faced a decision, do we put an LTE chip in every camera? Or do we bifurcate the SKUs and have a lower-cost WiFi-only camera and have a premium? We made the bet that, you know what, a connected camera will be so much more useful that we're going to put that chip in every camera so that we can turn that capability on for customers. Now by comparison, some of our competitors for years when asked about LTE, they were saying, well, our customers aren't asking for it. That is precisely the difference of how we think about these products. We don't think about profit optimization on the current generation. We think about what is the right thing to do that's going to enable us to create massive value over the long term. And sometimes, look, this is where Brittany holds me accountable; she's got to make sure the numbers work. But we have a very productive interplay about this, about how do we make the right level of investment bets and they are bets in that the answers are not necessarily knowable. But I think we're now seeing that coming true where it's like, wow, these real-time capabilities are very useful. And the agencies that have gone to live streaming every call for incidents, they survey their officers and you know what they're telling me? Unanimously, officers and dispatchers are saying they refuse to go back to a world without it. And those are the type of things we hear early in a product cycle that make us dig in hard because we know we've got -- this is a game-changing capability. Now it's just going to take some time for us to spread the word and get agencies to try it. And things like the watch me feature help agencies or unions that have concerns about privacy matters, have a way they can deploy it, it's responsive to those concerns. But I'm 100% convinced relying as a push-to-talk walkie talkie for the next 20 years as your only real means of communication is not how the world is going to evolve. Now I'm also very clear, we are not yet a mission-critical piece of communications. The current stuff will exist for quite some time alongside what we're doing. We're augmenting with new capabilities. And these agencies that are using our live stream with 2-way voice, what they're telling me is that it's offloading tons of traffic off the radio that not everybody else on the radio needs to hear. They're having more in-depth conversations, more rich conversations because it's not taking up radio airtime and that's actually making their radio use more productive and more focused.\nAndrea James: Thank you. Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum. You're up.\nJeremy Hamblin: Congrats on the strong results. I wanted to come back to the point that Brittany was making about the OSP bundles. And you just had tremendous acceleration in the velocity of growth in your cloud business is quite impressive over the last few quarters in particular. So if less than 20% of your potential base, state and local domestic is on OSP bundle, today, what would you have said that, that percentage was a year ago? Would it have been less than 10%? And then just coming back to the cloud revenue growth. Obviously, I think you talked about it's license growth but I wanted to just get a sense for just the expansion of the premium bundles as well. And how much of that is -- because just the value of that business has gone up tremendously in just the last 3 or 4 quarters.\nBrittany Bagley: Yes, I'll jump in. It's been great to see and great to watch. We last gave that penetration stat in Q3 of last year and it was less than 15%. So we have seen a nice increase in that over the last 9 months. And I think you're seeing that get reflected in some of the increase in our software revenue. I would say that there's also things where we're adding new products, right, this call out I made on standards. This is a product we've been investing in. We've been testing with customers we've had out there and we got it to the point where we could start recognizing revenue on it. And so those are exciting things that start to feed into our software business and our software recognition. I think if you're modeling it, for modeling purposes, we would still say a good 6 quarter average and maybe Q4 and Q2 of this year were particularly high because of onetime revenue in Q4 and the Standards piece in Q2. So I'm not sure it's fair to fully average those in. But I think your macro point of we're having great momentum in our software business and our customers are loving it. And they're adding more and we're upgrading people to premium bundles, I mean that is the heart of the story around the software cloud business and we're really excited to get to tell that story and to give those products to our customers.\nJeremy Hamblin: And then just a follow-up question is on the international side, as you think about OSP bundles. In terms of adoption rates on that segment of your business, how is that comparing to kind of the adoption curve that you saw domestically? Obviously, some different factors in terms of where taser penetration was a decade ago and so forth. So I imagine the curve could look a little bit different but just wanted to get an understanding of what you're seeing.\nJoshua Isner: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeremy. I would say that the international market is kind of bifurcated between our Tier 1 customers in the rest of world right now. In Tier 1, I think we are getting closer to OSP-like offerings. And that's because generally, you're not talking about one federal government buying everything. You're talking about cities like London and Manchester and Calgary and Edmonton and Ottawa or states in some cases and provinces in some cases. So -- and same in Australia. And so where there's heavy adoption of both and it's not all federal purchasing, I think we will see OSP adopted in those markets over time. In the rest of the world, the focus is really just landing in a large way with one product and then starting that journey which is go from one product to multiple products. And then when both of those products are more well adopted, that's when we talk about this kind of bundling concept. But the fact that you've got these large federal governments doing the buying in a lot of cases, it's both a good thing and a bad thing. It's great that the volumes can be way more exciting upfront but it's also harder to pair 2 products like that together because it's just very different processes relating to the procurement of each. And so we're working through it. And hopefully, over the next year or 2, we'll start to see OSP kind of take a foothold in some of those Tier 1 markets.\nAndrea James: Thanks for all the great questions. We're going to have Rick close us out.\nJoshua Isner: Before Rick closes us out, just one more thing, if it's all right. As we do the call backs tomorrow, I hope all of our analysts will wish Brittany a happy birthday. And happy birthday to you, Brittany.\nBrittany Bagley: Thanks, Josh. Sneaking that in.\nPatrick Smith: It's delightful to be able to share these results. Obviously, a ton of hard work went into this. I pinch myself every day that I get this fantastic job. These things don't happen by themselves. My view of this is this what happens when you have an amazing mission, you attract just unbelievably talented people, give them the freedom to operate and bring their own diverse backgrounds and talents into the team and let them run. And we're running hard and we're going to keep running hard for you, our investors and for our customers and, knock on wood, we'll be back to keep telling you about some of the great work our team is doing. You only get to see a handful of us. But behind the scenes, there's a cast of thousands of really talented people working really hard. So for those of you who on our team that are listening in, thank you for letting us bask in the light of results like these from the work you do. I look forward to seeing you all next quarter.",

            "name": "Jeffrey Kunins",
            "content": "Right, I think like you've heard us say so many times before, the power of that entire ecosystem distributed through this hardware plus software OSP and bundle philosophy is -- it is our Amazon Prime. It is our flavor of this opportunity that just inherently drives increased adoption and as customers get value out of one basket, it inherently motivates them to keep going up to higher and higher tiers and then to use more and more of what feels free to them because it's already in the basket that they have paid for and have access to. And to come back to connect that to one of the questions about federal and justice before, that's also the leverage of our R&D philosophy and approach at work where if you take something like DEMS that's had a decade of R&D investment in us to bring it to where it is, to be fit for purpose broadly for domestic and international law enforcement, it's a relatively light lift but to tailor that with a surgical part of our team to make it fit for purpose for the next adjacent market segments like prosecutors and justice, like things in the federal government and that instantly or relatively quickly unlocks whole new segments building on the back of R&D we've done before. And then once we've done that and we have momentum with federal customers in justice, it earns us the right to then start building bespoke products directly for those market segments. And that kind of successive laddering up from each angle is fundamental to our flywheel. That's right. I mean I think just echoing on all of what Josh said. This is a category where the meat and potatoes matters a lot and there's tons of exciting innovation. The -- no one -- everyone always wants more battery life and we're delivering there, bringing -- turning the POV from a separate product to a no-compromise simple accessory that's an add-on, we think is a game changer for a lot of agencies.

            "name": "Joshua Isner",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Rick. It's been an honor and a privilege to build my career at Axon. I care deeply about our mission, our customers and our team and I'm proud to help lead an organization that is unapologetic about winning. This team just blocks out the noise and executes and you can see that in our results. As Rick reflected, we are getting great feedback from customers about TASER 10 and Axon Body 4 and I'm especially pleased that this feedback is translating into orders. We closed the first half with strong orders and we expect a greater increase into the second half as we convert more of our new product pipeline. This drove our confidence in increasing our guidance which Brittany will take you through in a moment. In Q2, we continue to execute on our 2023 focus areas: revenue, profitability, new market expansion and new product adoption. We just finished our sixth consecutive quarter with revenue growth above 30%. This kind of growth doesn't just happen. It's a combination of having the right products, the right sales strategy and the right team to execute on an enormous market opportunity. And our relationships with our customers are truly deep. We don't just look for a transactional share or sale. We partner with our customers and make sure they are successful and they keep coming back to us so we can help them solve more problems. Our cloud business grew 62% year-over-year. And we are in the early days of expansion into new markets and products. Our software penetration remains low and we are finding ways to sell more software content into our installed base, executing against a $22 billion software TAM. Our TASER business grew 14% year-over-year and TASER 7 remains the greatest contributor for now and we are pleased to see incremental growth driven by early shipments of TASER 10. We are just getting started with that weapon and it's a game changer and we think it will drive TASER growth over the next several years. Profitability is our second operational focus and is critical to ensuring we have a sustainable business model to drive the next decade of our growth strategy. I am pleased with our team's focus and execution in Q2 as we stabilized gross margin through 2 of our largest product launches in company history, while growing our team at the same time. Third, our new market bookings grew ahead of revenue in Q2. We are seeing continued success in the federal market with first-half bookings up nearly triple digits year-over-year. And in justice, we have triple-digit bookings growth year-to-date. 4 of our 10 largest deals in the quarter came from new and emerging markets, a sign of continued diversification. Finally, new product adoption is critical to our success. We are gaining traction and we've seen emerging product bookings grow nearly 50% year-over-year. ALPR, auto tagging, Axon Records and Axon Respond, are a few key callouts here. We closed an incredible first half to the year and the outlook for our second half looks very solid. We are on to the next play. And with that, we'll turn it over to Brittany to go through the operations and financials in more detail. Brittany? Yes. Thanks a lot, Will. And it's good to see you and thanks again for having us at your conference in June. I'd say in terms of just growing cloud adoption for us, there's really two elements of it. Number one is making sure that we continue to proliferate kind of hardware in as many different forms as we can that plug into our cloud ecosystem. So the more body cameras we sell into our existing core market but also into international, federal and enterprise, obviously, that will drive more usage of Evidence.com. And likewise, the more enterprise software licenses we sell for things like records management, computer-aided dispatch, our justice product, Axon Air licenses, just the more software-only licenses that we continue to roll up here that will continue to provide favorable results as well in our cloud business. So it's really about doing those -- both of those things really well at the same time and the team has done a really nice job of that so far this year. Yes, great question and thank you. First of all, one that we're really excited about is a deal in our justice segment. So here, we're talking about prosecutors buying kind of enterprise licenses for Evidence.com and tightly integrating with the police departments. And so that was 1 of the 4. A couple were federal. And certainly, we continue to see those become more common and at larger dollar amounts as well which are both very encouraging signs and speaks to all the great work Richard Coleman and his team are doing in our federal business. And then lastly, in international. In our Tier 1 markets, the U.K., Canada and Australia, we still see very meaningful orders coming out of those markets, both across TASER and body cams and Evidence.com. And then we continue to start to make more headway in some of these large markets outside of those 3. And generally, at those -- at this point, those have been more taser-oriented orders as we continue to evangelize the cloud and work with our early kind of opportunities on getting some of these major customers on to the cloud. So that's a little bit of background around where some of those are coming from. Yes, Josh, thank you for the great question. A couple of ways to think about this. So coming out of the first half of the year, as everyone remembers, we're a little more conservative on what our guidance would look like for that reason because there's this period when you launch new products where you don't know if customers are going to want to just continue with what they have or trial the new product before buying it or just switch right over to the new product. And so I think we've kind of cleared out a lot of those uncertainties at this point. And I think it's fair to say that a lot of the interest has converted from TASER 7 to TASER 10. And so customers that were on order for TASER 7 kind of pumped the brakes, wanted to trial TASER 10 and now we're moving in that direction. AB4 is a separate -- a little bit of a separate motion because the early volumes of those cameras are driven by hardware upgrades in our TASER Assurance Plan, not as much book and ship like right out of the gate. And so 2 kind of slightly different stories there. But yes, as those things become better in focus, it allows us to get a little more aggressive with our guidance. And as the year comes together and that, combined with a really solid back-half pipeline, gives us a lot of confidence moving into the last 2 quarters of the year here. Yes. Ultimately for us and we've talked a little about this in the past but the big kind of focus for our sales team is selling our Officer Safety Plans which have a number of different software features in across DEMS and Records and Standards, product which is kind of a use-of-force tracking product. So there's a lot in those plans. And ultimately, the more of those bundles we sell, the higher our ARPU will be in software. And then when we combine that with kind of picking up momentum, both on the records management side and in the justice segment and then in some of our new markets, those things combined to offer a nice uplift over just kind of our base Evidence.com licensing. And so it's really a combination of those 2 things. And I totally agree with Rick and the only thing I'd add on that is there are extra licenses every agency buys for non-sworn personnel and that number will only go up with Axon Records. And so that's a big piece of the puzzle here as you think about the police officers on the street choosing our body cameras and tasers but then all of the people in the back office that need access to records and evidence, that's a substantial uplift as well. So in addition to some of the new market and kind of DEMS-only features that Rick talked about, there's an element of just our domestic customers adding on more and more as our product portfolio grows. Maybe I'll talk about a little bit of the demand and I'll hand it over to Brittany to talk about the mix and margins. In terms of demand, yes, we absolutely see customers and I've said this maybe in the last call and to others as well, like this is the first product where our customers have a genuine interest in upgrading early to it. Usually, because there's a training uplift and there's challenges around deploying it across thousands and thousands of users, you kind of kick the can down the road to the end of your useful life before you upgrade to the next one because it's a lot to bite off to deploy a new taser. In this case, agencies are willing to accelerate that process in favor of getting this weapon on the streets faster. And so the early feedback continues to be very strong. Customers that -- there were even some customers who didn't move to T7 from X2 who are now jumping straight to T10 with the 10 shots and increased distance. So very, very bullish on T10 adoption over the next a couple of years here. Now keep in mind, internationally and in some domestic markets as well, there's still a trial period that takes place where agencies want to field it and get enough data. And so it doesn't happen all at once. But I think over the next couple of years, our TASER business will continue to grow on the back of more TASER 10 handles in the field. Yes. I just wanted to say, I wouldn't get too caught up in the kind of sequential trends because they can vary a little depending on when we ship especially large orders. And so for us, we're really focused on that. As we said, we've grown 30% for 6 straight quarters. That's really what we try to look at is our yearly CAGR and focus on that. And there might be a little noise quarter-to-quarter on how that looks. But over the course of the year, it seems to kind of normalize. Yes. I don't know that we're prepared to give any specifics on that today. But I would say kind of with a broader brush, we try to do 2 things really well at the same time. We try to sell new products to our existing customers and we try to sell existing products to new customers. And if we do both of those well, meaning like in our core U.S. market, it's really about selling all those new products like VR, some of the software packages and features I mentioned, computer-aided dispatch, et cetera. And then internationally, in corrections, in justice and our federal business, it's more about selling our kind of core products, tasers, body cams, DEMS, into those to create kind of that opportunity to land and expand. And so ultimately, we look at both of those metrics, new product sales and new market sales every quarter. And really happy to say that we're trending very nicely on each of those -- in each of those categories right now. Maybe I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Jeff and Rick. I think ultimately, there's some incremental improvements in there around battery and optics and so forth. But really launching the 2-way voice as part of AB4. We're most excited that it actually fits a need in the market right now and that customers have a variety of use cases where the value relative to the radio, of being able to see something playing out for the dispatcher or for a mental health expert or for a translator, watching the screen and being able to communicate through the body camera with a community member, that is something that our customers are very excited about and we're seeing more and more adoption of that feature set early on. So I think that's one of the key differentiators. It's also nice to bring back our POV functionality. We haven't really launched anything new there since Flex 2. And now just a simple attachment to the body camera instead of a whole new product in SKU makes that a lot more easily adopted and tailored to certain use cases and just flexible overall for our customers. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeremy. I would say that the international market is kind of bifurcated between our Tier 1 customers in the rest of world right now. In Tier 1, I think we are getting closer to OSP-like offerings. And that's because generally, you're not talking about one federal government buying everything. You're talking about cities like London and Manchester and Calgary and Edmonton and Ottawa or states in some cases and provinces in some cases. So -- and same in Australia. And so where there's heavy adoption of both and it's not all federal purchasing, I think we will see OSP adopted in those markets over time. In the rest of the world, the focus is really just landing in a large way with one product and then starting that journey which is go from one product to multiple products. And then when both of those products are more well adopted, that's when we talk about this kind of bundling concept. But the fact that you've got these large federal governments doing the buying in a lot of cases, it's both a good thing and a bad thing. It's great that the volumes can be way more exciting upfront but it's also harder to pair 2 products like that together because it's just very different processes relating to the procurement of each. And so we're working through it. And hopefully, over the next year or 2, we'll start to see OSP kind of take a foothold in some of those Tier 1 markets. Before Rick closes us out, just one more thing, if it's all right. As we do the call backs tomorrow, I hope all of our analysts will wish Brittany a happy birthday. And happy birthday to you, Brittany."

            "content": "Thank you, Josh. And thank you, Rick, for the kind words. I'm very excited to take on more of the business and to continue driving the next stage of operational excellence at this fantastic company. Turning to the results. We reported another strong quarter, reflecting broad strength across our business. Our top line grew 31% year-over-year and we saw EBITDA margins of 22%. Second quarter gross margin of 62% improved sequentially, primarily reflecting business mix from software. As you saw in our shareholder letter, we did have some noise in our segment margins this quarter as we worked to more closely align our overhead costs with our specific product lines and had some onetime adjustments. On an aggregated basis, however, most of that is allocations between segments and our overall gross margins reflect a mix benefit from software. Axon Cloud and services revenue made up 35% of total revenue this quarter compared with 29% a year ago. As we noted last quarter, we would expect full year gross margin to remain approximately flat or improve modestly from Q1 2023 levels due to continued professional services related to Fleet 3 and the continuing ramp of Axon Body 4 and TASER 10. We continue to believe there are opportunities next year and over the long term to improve our margin profile as we invest in automation and recognize scale efficiencies from recent product launches. We also expect to continue to see mix benefits from our software growth. We believe we will exit this year at a more normalized run rate demand for our Fleet product, having largely caught up on our backlog. Turning to our operating expenses. We saw leverage out of both R&D and SG&A. We continue to invest absolute dollars to drive our product road map and to scale our business rapidly. We're pleased with the adjusted EBITDA margin of 22% in the quarter but given the second half gross margin profile and timing of some OpEx investments, continue to keep our guidance at 20% for the year. With our increase in revenue, this does result in us dropping more to the bottom line for the year and we're continuing to focus on how we can better leverage our OpEx, especially in SG&A over the longer term. Turning to our guidance. We are increasing our full year revenue outlook to a range of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion, representing about 27% to 29% growth. We continue to target full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% which implies an increased range of $302 million to $306 million of adjusted EBITDA. In terms of the healthy guidance increase, we always want to make sure we can deliver on what we say we are going to do. And that continues to be our focus while at the same time, making sure we're doing our best to accurately reflect what we're seeing in the business. We had 2 major hardware product launches this year and the successful rollout of these products as well as the robust customer response to these launches has given us the confidence to increase our forecast after a strong first half of the year. We do expect most of the increase relative to our prior forecast to occur in the fourth quarter due to typical seasonality. With that, I would like to open it up to questions. It's a great question. Thank you, Will. I think part of it goes down to -- comes down to what we see in our business. And I think we were very careful as we came into the year not to get ahead of ourselves in terms of what we were expecting for AB4 and TASER 10, given that those were 2 big launches for us. But we have seen, as Rick and Josh both commented, just wonderful customer reception to those products. And so we have good visibility, both in terms of what we can ramp up from a manufacturing standpoint that gives us confidence in the volume of those products that we'll have available. And then I would say you couple what we have available from an operational standpoint with what we're seeing from the customers and we think we have pretty good visibility in terms of delivering in the second half of the year. I think, as I said, we're partway through Q3 right now and so we can call out that we think some of that will be in Q4, especially as we ramp into AB4 and see the timing of some of the contracts that we have coming in and some of the deals we have in the pipeline with customers. And then I think the other thing is just our cloud and services revenue. As you can see, it's done very nicely this year. And that is just a very reliable recurring software business that we can bank on every quarter. And we look at that as we go through the second half of the year, combined with the TASER 10 and AB4 products and that's what gives us confidence in that guidance. Yes, of course. So there's a lot of moving pieces in our gross margin, as you can tell, from going through our shareholder letter. I think the biggest thing is we have had some headwinds on gross margin this year, really from 3 main pieces. One, getting TASER 10 ready to go, ready to ramp, ready to be scaled in production. And we expect -- we continue to ramp and scale that business as we go through the year but that's really a next-year event when we think that that's fully scaled and ramped up. So factored into our gross margins this year but should be a gross margin benefit for next year. I think it's similar on the launch of AB4. There's just a period of time while we go through a transition of bringing a new product up and getting it ready to get launched that again, weighing a bit on this year should be nice for us next year. And then probably the last piece that we talked about last quarter, it's continuing to impact the cloud and services gross margin which you noted for this quarter, is just the professional services on our Fleet installations. So our Fleet has been a phenomenal product for us this year. Some of that was because we were inventory-constrained and had some backlog coming into this year and we've really been working through that. But with Fleet, we sell the hardware. We have professional services to install the hardware. That is a bit of a hit to gross margin for us in a onetime way. And then we turn on software associated with the Fleet product. And so once we're through the professional services install, we have nice recurring software revenue attached to the Fleet camera. But our volumes of Fleet are so high this year, you can view that as a bit of an investment in gross margin to unlock nice long-term software revenue sort of next year and beyond. I'm going to throw in a little bit of extra color for you on that. Our TASER 7 was pretty stable in this quarter. So there's certainly a dynamic of customers getting very excited about TASER 10 but we're still seeing very nice support and volume from TASER 7. I would think about a lot of the growth in the taser segment this quarter coming from TASER 10 starting to ramp up and get into customers. And then I would say similarly on our cameras, we didn't see significant growth in our camera business in Q2 and that really was because as we go do those refreshes, we're going to let customers who want to refresh on AB4, refresh on AB4. We just started shipping AB4. And so again, you'll see some of that be stronger in the second half of the year. Yes. I would say it's shifting, I would say the greater bottleneck coming out of '22 was probably on the hardware, on the actual inventory side. And now we've done a nice job catching up on that and really the bottleneck now, it's not a bottleneck because we're ramping up to get it to customers. But the gating item is really more around the installations. I would just -- I would add, 100% agree, everything Josh said is spot on. I mean we are seeing very healthy demand for our premium bundles and that's driving our strong net revenue retention. It's driving growth in the software business, the domestic E.com, Evidence.com licenses drove the largest sequential increase. I think the other thing I would note for this quarter is we were able to start recognizing revenue for our Standards product now that we have it in general availability. And so that helped make the step up slightly larger this quarter than it has been in some other quarters. And so we spend a lot of time talking about how big is the size of the step. It was definitely larger this quarter and we continue to look at it more as an average of quarters over time. It was slightly smaller in Q1. It was big in Q4. It's big this quarter. So it's been lumpy as we've had some of these revenue recognition pieces come together. But overall, the domestic Evidence.com business is driving the bulk of that and thus why you're seeing such nice healthy growth in that segment. I would just add, Keith, that I think because the demand has been so strong from an operational perspective, we can build in what we know we can manufacture. We really are still ramping that up. And so for the rest of this year, we've got a pretty good sense of how many handles we can actually make. And given the demands out there, that's what we can factor into our model. It is taking us some time to get it fully ramped up and scaled from a manufacturing standpoint. Next year, I think not only will we have more scaled manufacturing but we will have been able to invest in some of the automation for both the handle and the cartridges to help get the initial cost down and improve that gross margin. I think we're largely getting through our inventory supply constraints. And now we're really looking at what it will take to get Fleet installed. And so as you go through this year, you'll see basically what is normalized healthy run rate for Fleet from a demand standpoint. Remember, as I said earlier on this call, we have 3 pieces of Fleet revenue. You have the hardware which is showing up in the Fleet line item of our reporting. So you've got the hardware. You have the professional services which goes into our services line item. And then you have the software revenue that gets turned on once we have it installed. So as we come out of this year, you'll see a really nice level of run rate demand. And I would expect as we get through this year, we're at a good level of run rate demand for professional services installations as well on that Fleet product. Josh, did you want to jump in? The only thing we do give and we gave it in our shareholder letter, is that the penetration rate of our Officer Safety Plan is less than 20% relative to our potential state and local law enforcement installed base. So I think we have both great ability to land as well as expand, to Josh's point. Yes, I'll jump in. It's been great to see and great to watch. We last gave that penetration stat in Q3 of last year and it was less than 15%. So we have seen a nice increase in that over the last 9 months. And I think you're seeing that get reflected in some of the increase in our software revenue. I would say that there's also things where we're adding new products, right, this call out I made on standards. This is a product we've been investing in. We've been testing with customers we've had out there and we got it to the point where we could start recognizing revenue on it. And so those are exciting things that start to feed into our software business and our software recognition. I think if you're modeling it, for modeling purposes, we would still say a good 6 quarter average and maybe Q4 and Q2 of this year were particularly high because of onetime revenue in Q4 and the Standards piece in Q2. So I'm not sure it's fair to fully average those in. But I think your macro point of we're having great momentum in our software business and our customers are loving it. And they're adding more and we're upgrading people to premium bundles, I mean that is the heart of the story around the software cloud business and we're really excited to get to tell that story and to give those products to our customers. Thanks, Josh. Sneaking that in."

            "name": "Patrick Smith",
            "content": "All right. Great job, Andrea and Angel and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. It's great to be coming back to you with another excellent quarter and an even brighter outlook. I'm fortunate to spend most of my time talking to customers. Reception to our new products has been fantastic. Recently, I met with police chiefs who said, once their officers take TASER 10 out in the field, they will not go out again without it. After trials and successful de-escalations in the field, some have even joked that their officers are saying, you'd have to pry my TASER 10 from my cold dead fingers. This is the type of feedback that motivates us and keeps us moving forward. Axon Body 4 began shipping in June and we're also getting a great response. Later, you will hear from Brittany, who we recently promoted to Chief Operating Officer in addition to her role as CFO. Bringing these two roles together under Brittany sets us up for our next phase of operational excellence. As COO and CFO, Brittany will oversee our margin profile from end to end to ensure we execute on our ambition to deliver profitable growth for many years to come. Brittany has been a star addition to our team. She brings operational rigor, foresight, stewardship and candor. We also promoted Josh Isner who previously served as our CRO, then COO and is now President. Josh has been an instrumental leader at Axon for more than a decade. And during his tenure, he and I have worked side-by-side evolving and growing the company. I have given Josh many challenges over the years and he's never failed to exceed my expectations. As President, Josh will continue to oversee day-to-day operations while taking on an expanded role within the executive team and with our Board members. Expanding responsibilities for my team allows me to focus on what inspires me: our products and our customers. Product development will always be a key part of my job description. For years, you've heard me talk about my sometimes-futuristic views of what the market needs. And for years, we have successfully innovated. So what's around the corner? I'll touch on 2 key areas: robotic security and generative AI. In June, we acquired Sky-Hero which builds upon our strategy for robotic security and is highly synergistic with our product road map. Sky-Hero gives us a leading indoor tactical drone solution that complements our existing Axon Air strategy. While the acquisition will not be a meaningful revenue contributor this year, it fits into our long-term vision. We want to make the world a safer place and avoid situations where we have to send people through the door into highly dangerous, even deadly situations. Sky-Hero is already selling to U.S. federal government customers and SWAT teams in the U.S. and all across Europe who give very strong feedback about the value, durability, usability and reliability of their technology. Sky-Hero is based in Belgium and unlocks many new customer relationships across Europe. I was especially impressed with CEO, Yves and his team which is small and scrappy and they really move fast. They're going to fit in great here at Axon. And finally, here's how we're thinking about generative AI and large language models. Like we've already been doing with traditional AI, we will use these newer technologies to create game-changing products for our law enforcement customers. Several years ago, we published a video on the future of policing. This video features scenes where a police officer was able to feed their body camera video into an AI system which then created a draft report, auto populated of the details in the audio/video record. The point is, we were talking about generative AI before it really even existed in a usable form. Now I'm not sharing this for bragging rights but what it means for you is that we don't have to pivot our strategy because our strategy has anticipated this future reality for years. We spend a lot of our time and I spend most of my mental energy studying key technology trends and then mapping those trends against customer needs. We don't wait for the customer to ask for it. We don't even wait for the technology to exist. We map evolving technologies that we believe will mature in the coming years against existing customer pain points and then we invest early, so our ecosystem will be ready to catch the ball when the underlying technology matures. This is precisely what is happening now with large language models and with broader generative AI. Our mission-driven philosophy to leverage exponential technologies to solve the problems we care about is the core to our value creation engine. An investment in Axon is investing in the future of AI and it has been for several years. The flywheel for AI technologies, including LLMs, is powered by signals and data. We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars into building out an ecosystem of wearable cameras and sensors and the world's leading cloud platform that securely hosts the enormous data generated by this expansive ecosystem. Everything we have built over the past decade has been in a -- position us to be able to safely and ethically and securely collect, share and analyze that data for our customers, paving the way for public safety adoption of ever more advanced AI tools. These tools will build upon and expand the AI applications that are already a critical component of the Axon ecosystem. And just like we evangelized and we're the first to bring cloud software at scale to public safety, we think Axon will lead the way and bring advanced AI designed with thoughtful, ethical controls at scale to public safety. We're already seeing really promising results from our early work here and we're just getting started. You're up, Josh. Josh, if I could add in a little bit as well. Just very rough, if we look at the long term, right now, international is about 1/5 of our business. At scale, international -- I mean, the U.S. should be about 1/5 of our business. The rest of the world is at least 5x larger than the U.S. market is. And so as we -- we're very focused on opening these markets but police face similar challenges around the world. Now there's one unique thing about the United States and that is the gun culture of the public that is quite different from the challenges other countries face. And in some ways, that makes TASER 10 even more transformative in every other country around the world because I think what we've generally seen is U.S. police will carry a gun and a taser. We've seen that less likely to be something that our international customers would do. But if you're a police officer in a country where the public doesn't really have firearms, a TASER 10 could actually become the primary defensive weapon in those markets because, frankly, if you are, for example, a French police officer and you need a firearm, chances are it's not petty criminals with a gun. You might be dealing with some sort of terrorist event where a pistol is probably not the right tool anyway. And so I believe T10 actually is the biggest game changer in those international markets to give us beachheads where we could really begin to expand the growth because, again, long term, we need to succeed as a truly global company. And when we do that, these international markets should frankly dwarf our U.S. market. Let me jump in over Josh. I'm excited on this one. Like, for example, the country of Scotland selected us for their digital evidence management system across police, prosecutor's courts, the whole country and they are not using our body cameras. We've had some similar albeit -- I'm not sure which ones we've specifically disclosed or not but we've had other international agencies move software first. And that's something that we're really proud of. And obviously, our software teams take great pride in that as well that 10 years ago, our software was basically an enabler of our hardware. And now they're both strong on their own and our software products, especially things like Records can stand on their own, although some of the generative AI stuff I alluded to in my comments, are a true game changer. When an agency is using our body cameras and our cloud software, our ability to unlock all the valuable data that's given in those audio, video records for our customers is pretty awesome. And so we think we are very well positioned and we look forward to coming back with more details. Don't want to get out over my skis but we have been doing some -- we're always inventing and prototyping with our customers and we're just hearing really positive feedback on things that we've not even announced yet. So that growth engine of doing the hardware and the software enables us to do things that you can't do -- if you can't do both those things together. So it's actually not changing a ton. Over the past 5 to 6 years, I've been wanting to put more and more focus on customers and technology, really creating -- understanding the pain of our customers, conveying the story that is our existing ecosystem and writing the story for the next 10 years. And focusing on that requires just frankly a very different mental outlook than running a business day to day. So if I went back 5 or 10 years ago, to be honest, I was getting quite burned out. It's just very difficult to run a large organization and then go, oh, in between this endless e-mail inbox and all the to dos of managing the business, let me now pause and shift to creatively looking at understanding what does the next phase look like. And so I think these promotions just sort of clarify those roles and this is giving basically Brittany more control over the operational excellence of our margins and our -- everything in the manufacturing supply chain to really make sure we're delivering. It's giving Josh -- he's actually taking a little bit more of -- some of, for example, my interactions with the Board that are more operational in terms -- Josh actually tends to lead most of the Board meetings in terms of the agendas, et cetera. And what that allows me to do is focus less on what we're doing and much more engaging -- so during Board meetings, for example, I'm very focused on driving discussions at a highly strategic level. And I think we play to each other's strengths. So my wife will tell you, I'm working harder than ever and I'm traveling more than ever out with customers and large expos because I don't have a list of to dos I've got to do around internally in the office. And I know we've got a team and I've got a very long relationship with Josh and with Brittany so only having been here little over a year, I think now, we've rapidly developed that same connective tissue, where we kind of understand each other's strengths. And that allows me to focus on the thing that I'm uniquely able to do as a founder CEO and that is -- as I mentioned in my script but I just want to really call attention to it. The reason I think founder-led companies outperform and the academic data kind of shows that, is when we focus on what -- like what is the next big leg that is not obvious, like, a traditional large business. Most of our competitors are focusing on basically running up kind of a profit-driven machine and each product manager is sort of asking the customers kind of what they want. My job is to predict what the customers aren't asking for yet and to match that up to various technologies. And there's a fair amount of risk that comes with that but the rewards are significant and we saw that when we created the taser market, the body cam market, the cloud market. No customers were productively asking for those. I think we're ahead of the ball on AI. We think about overall how we communicate. When I was a child in 19 -- in the early '70s, I communicated with a rotary dial phone in my house and police had push-to-talk walkie talkies. Today, I don't have a rotary phone, like we're doing Zoom with people around the world and our customers' primary mechanism of communicating is still push-to-talk walkie talkies. Like I think in the next 10 years, that will no longer be their primary method of communication. Police will be using audio, video sensors and AI to manage the massive amount of data flow so that we're collecting what is happening in the field, distributing that information to the right people and then cycling back to that officer in the field in a very focused way the information they need to know through the media that is most efficient for them to do it. It's least distracting while they're doing this difficult job. So it's solving those sort of problems. And frankly, Jeff has done such an amazing job of building an amazing team. So when I talk about solving that problem, we've got people like Ron McCatty [ph], who built Alexa drop-in, calling that revolutionized personal communications for 100 million people, including me, right, probably far more than that now so I could talk to my mom when she was -- had mental dementia and couldn't answer a phone and my kids could drop in on her from our kitchen, that sort of disruptive communication experience is part of what we're looking at now in the next 10 years. So that's where I spend my time and that's why I'm not answering many questions about margin and budget because I've got a strong team that I know is all over that, so I can focus on the future. So one last thing, I'll jump in on. When we designed AB3 a number of years ago, we had -- we faced a decision, do we put an LTE chip in every camera? Or do we bifurcate the SKUs and have a lower-cost WiFi-only camera and have a premium? We made the bet that, you know what, a connected camera will be so much more useful that we're going to put that chip in every camera so that we can turn that capability on for customers. Now by comparison, some of our competitors for years when asked about LTE, they were saying, well, our customers aren't asking for it. That is precisely the difference of how we think about these products. We don't think about profit optimization on the current generation. We think about what is the right thing to do that's going to enable us to create massive value over the long term. And sometimes, look, this is where Brittany holds me accountable; she's got to make sure the numbers work. But we have a very productive interplay about this, about how do we make the right level of investment bets and they are bets in that the answers are not necessarily knowable. But I think we're now seeing that coming true where it's like, wow, these real-time capabilities are very useful. And the agencies that have gone to live streaming every call for incidents, they survey their officers and you know what they're telling me? Unanimously, officers and dispatchers are saying they refuse to go back to a world without it. And those are the type of things we hear early in a product cycle that make us dig in hard because we know we've got -- this is a game-changing capability. Now it's just going to take some time for us to spread the word and get agencies to try it. And things like the watch me feature help agencies or unions that have concerns about privacy matters, have a way they can deploy it, it's responsive to those concerns. But I'm 100% convinced relying as a push-to-talk walkie talkie for the next 20 years as your only real means of communication is not how the world is going to evolve. Now I'm also very clear, we are not yet a mission-critical piece of communications. The current stuff will exist for quite some time alongside what we're doing. We're augmenting with new capabilities. And these agencies that are using our live stream with 2-way voice, what they're telling me is that it's offloading tons of traffic off the radio that not everybody else on the radio needs to hear. They're having more in-depth conversations, more rich conversations because it's not taking up radio airtime and that's actually making their radio use more productive and more focused. It's delightful to be able to share these results. Obviously, a ton of hard work went into this. I pinch myself every day that I get this fantastic job. These things don't happen by themselves. My view of this is this what happens when you have an amazing mission, you attract just unbelievably talented people, give them the freedom to operate and bring their own diverse backgrounds and talents into the team and let them run. And we're running hard and we're going to keep running hard for you, our investors and for our customers and, knock on wood, we'll be back to keep telling you about some of the great work our team is doing. You only get to see a handful of us. But behind the scenes, there's a cast of thousands of really talented people working really hard. So for those of you who on our team that are listening in, thank you for letting us bask in the light of results like these from the work you do. I look forward to seeing you all next quarter."

And before we turn the call over to Rick, we will play our quarterly update ideas about a 5-minute video today. [Video Presentation]\nPatrick Smith: Alright. Thank you, and great job, Andrea and Angel. Hello, and welcome to our shareholders. We feel great that 2023 is off to a fantastic start after announcing our moonshot goal last year to produce gun related deaths between police and the public by 50% over the next 10 years. We brought to market two major product releases that can serve as the workhorses to help get us there. When we talk about our moonshot goal to cut gun deaths, TASER 10 is our Saturn 5 rocket. And Axon Body 4 is mission control. Customer reception to TASER 10 has been great. We began shipping in March and many customers have called the product a true game changer. For those of you who are new to our business, new TASER devices take a few quarters to ramp in terms of sales as our customers need to trial and get trained before they can go into full deployment. Next, as you saw in the video, as Axon Accelerate last month, we announced Axon Body 4. 4 years ago on our earnings call, I told you about our vision for the future of body cameras and public safety. And once our cameras can talk over wireless networks, they\u2019ve become something more like an Alexa on your chest as opposed to just a camera you wear to record, and that would open up a whole host of really interesting services. Well, now for the first time ever, officers and remote support teams can communicate with one another in real time with a two-way device. We think this is going to provide an entirely new level of awareness and situational support, especially when officers are dealing with mental health crises or battling language barriers. Our customers are already thinking of new ways to apply this technology, and we can\u2019t wait to see what they\u2019ll do with it. Our vision for the future of public safety technology is coming together. When our new TASER and body cameras are paired with Axon respond, the full power of our real-time operational capabilities is unlocked. We can solve so many of the decision-making challenges public safety professionals space today. And I\u2019m fortunate to be leading a company that has attracted the best talent across the globe to achieve what we set out to do. We believe people are inspired to do their best work when they are truly inspired to solve the problems that they care about. So we hire people who are passionate about our mission. And we saw big problems. We create value and everything else falls into place. Finally, I\u2019d also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Axon\u2019s inclusion in the S&P 500 as of May 4, a testament to Axon\u2019s stable business model, our growth mission and our global impact. Thank you to our customers, partners and employees for making this positive. We founded Axon 30 years ago in the Tucson garage, and it has been a remarkable journey and our best days are yet to come. And so with that, I\u2019d like to turn over to our Chief Operating Officer, Josh Isner.\nJosh Isner: Thanks a lot, Rick. Enthusiasm from our customers has been infectious. What really moves me is when our customers see our passion and they become a part of it. Our annual Accelerate conference this year was the biggest and best we ever hosted. When customers tell me that we are motivating them and changing the way they approach their jobs for the better, I know we are doing our job. We see a strong and growing demand pipeline for 2023 and beyond, and we remain focused on doing our best work. In February, I spoke about 4 areas of focus for 2023 and I am pleased to report we are executing well on each of these objectives. Our number one operational focus is revenue. Top line growth remains a priority. We grow our business so that we can invest and deliver more value to the market. Our investments are paying off. We grew the top line 34% year-over-year in Q1, achieving a record quarterly revenue for the company. Our cloud business grew 51% year-over-year, and it\u2019s remarkable to reflect that just a few years ago, cloud applications were nearly unheard of in public safety. We\u2019ve been proud to evangelize public safety cloud adoption in the U.S., and we will continue to do so globally. Our Taser weapons business grew 17% year-over-year, and most of that was tied to continuing strong demand of our TASER 7 platform. We are only in the early stages of shipping our newest product, TASER 10, which is seeing the strongest initial demand of any TASER weapon in the history of the economy. I have seen several TASER product launches at Axon and customer enthusiasm for TASER 10 trumps any previous model. Our second operational focus is profitability, which we measure by adjusted EBITDA margin. Brittany will take you through the details in a minute, but at a high level, I\u2019m pleased with our performance in Q1. Number three, new market expansion. In the first quarter, our international booking grew double digits, driven by nearly 100% year-over-year bookings growth in Europe. And we also saw triple-digit bookings growth in our Justice segment, an emerging market for us. We\u2019ve invested heavily in our sales force and continue to support new capabilities in these new markets, and we\u2019re seeing leverage from these investments. Finally, number four, new product adoption, we are tirelessly investing to ensure that the products we build continue to be adopted by our customers. We saw double-digit bookings growth in a number of our emerging product categories, including ALPR, air and virtual reality. The foundation underpinning all of these priorities is our ability to attract and then retain world-class talent. We cannot accomplish any of this without the help of a team who brings financial discipline, a next play mindset and the skill sets to launch us through the stratosphere of our moonshot journey. We enjoy high employee retention rates, which outperformed tech averages, and this is a testament to our mission and our ability to focus on solving real problems. In sum, we executed strongly in Q1, have launched into two new products. Our pipeline is solid and we have line of sight to a very strong back half. I\u2019m proud of our team for driving such a strong start to the year, but I am even more proud that they have quickly turned the page and are focused on sustaining the momentum in Q2 and beyond. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brittany to take us through our financials in more detail. Thanks a lot.\nBrittany Bagley: Thank you, Josh. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, reflecting broad-based strength across our business. Our top line growth of almost 34% year-over-year supported by 51% growth in our cloud business continues to demonstrate the value of our offering. Given Q1 performance, we are confident in our outlook and raising our revenue growth rate from 20% to 22% for the year. On gross margin, we had some sequential headwinds in Q1 coming from revenue mix as we grew Axon Fleet sales and the professional services associated with those and did repeat the gross margin benefit of catch-up software revenue that we saw in Q4 of \u201822. Gross margin also reflects an impact of onetime items related to inventory and other cost adjustments. Over the remaining quarters of \u201823, we expect fleet demand to remain strong. And as a result, we would expect gross margins to remain approximately flat or improve only modestly from Q1 level. To double-click on the impact of fleet, demand for Fleet 3 has consistently exceeded our expectations since we began shipping in 2021. Our fleet business carries a lower margin upfront and transitions to high-margin recurring software revenue over time. In the first quarter, for example, fleet revenue grew 139% year-over-year. Fulfilling this demand solidifies our market leadership and sets us up for long-term success. When our customers buy more of our hardware, they are also investing in our broader ecosystem of high-margin software offering. We also continue to invest in automation and improving our manufacturing efficiency, and we\u2019re pleased to see the supply chain stabilizing in 2023 as expected. Over time, these efforts along with ongoing growth in our high-margin software business should continue to benefit gross margins. Regarding operating expenses, R&D investment remains a priority to support our long-term revenue growth. We continue to digest SG&A investments we made over the past year and are balancing OpEx discipline with the investments needed to scale our business to $2 billion in revenue and beyond. As we had anticipated, travel expenses have also increased as everyone returns to in-person meetings and events. I am pleased to upwardly revise our outlook. We are increasing our full year revenue range of $1.44 billion to $1.46 billion, representing 22% year-over-year revenue growth at the midpoint. We continue to target full year adjusted EBITDA margins of 20%, implying a range of $288 million to $292 million. We remain focused on delivering on both our near-term and long-term financial commitments. In addition to the above, these include free cash flow, moving towards long-term sustainable equity dilution, responsible management of our balance sheet and continuing to support our partner ecosystem. All of these are in great shape exiting Q1. Longer term, we continue to focus on delivering on our top line growth while expanding our gross margins leveraging our OpEx and increasing our adjusted EBITDA as we work towards our 2025 target of 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. Great new products, including TASER 10, Axon Body 4, fleet and our software will all continue to support this outlook. I look forward to updating you further on our continued progress next quarter. And with that, I would like to open it up to questions.\nA - Andrea James: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Tim Long at Barclays. Tim, you are up.\nTim Long: Thank you. I was hoping I could sneak two in here. First, on the full year outlook, if you could just talk a little bit, obviously, growth in Q1 was pretty strong so implying a little bit of a decel in the second half of the year, I guess, towards the end, the compares get tougher. But can you just talk a little bit about the rest of the outlook and why \u2013 what\u2019s built into a little bit more conservative growth than we saw in Q1? And then second, if you could just touch on kind of the new products coming out. Obviously, it sounds like a lot of demand. How does that fit into those that have subscriptions if someone\u2019s not on a subscription, they want to upgrade or accelerated and upgrade. Can you just talk about how you could see a benefit from these new products even if people are tied into a medium to longer term subscription deal?\nBrittany Bagley: Maybe I\u2019ll take guidance and then turn customers over to Josh. Okay. So as we look at our guidance for the full year, obviously, we\u2019re really pleased with our strong Q1 performance. Part of what goes along with introducing new products, though, like TASER 10 and near term for Axon Body 4 as there is a transition period as our customers transition to those new products and are buying less of our existing older products. So as we look at our guidance, we\u2019re baking that transition into our guidance we\u2019re also baking in the fact that we had a really strong back half of last year, and so the comps get more difficult as we look at the second half.\nJosh Isner: Yes, absolutely. And just to add to that, we never want to get out over our skis on guidance. I think certainly, there are paths to outperforming guidance and like we are working towards those. But until we see that actually materialize in the pipeline and a way we can feel a lot of confidence in, it\u2019s important to be measured as to how we look at the data we have today. And so certainly, the focus is delivering as good of a year revenue-wise as we can, and we feel confident that we have the team to do that and on top of that, in terms of how we build in new products into our bundles and offerings. I think those are actually the opportune times to rewrite a lot of contracts. And so whenever there\u2019s a new product that comes out either a flagship product like a TASER, new TASER CW or a new body camera or something like a new software offering that gives us the opportunity to go back to those customers and demo those products and as customers kind of value them, they start asking questions about, hey, how do we build this into our contract and that leads to conversations about upgrading the bundle or adding on to the bundle. So those are great opportunities for our sales team to rewrite these contracts for the longer term. So that\u2019s how we look at kind of new product introduction into the sales process.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks.\nAndrea James: Okay. We\u2019ll go next to Keith Housum at Northcoast. Keith is in a public space doing our earnings call. So maybe we will come back to Keith. Okay. We will go to Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Go ahead, Sami.\nSami Badri: Alright. Thank you. I had first a tricky question and then maybe some less tricky questions. So first one, maybe to Rick, one thing that has been really clear is, as a company, you\u2019ve released many products at various price points, many software capabilities and you\u2019re introducing virtual reality training and software. The kind of the big question is how are police departments making space for all these budget line items that they are now having to pay for? And maybe the justification could be very straightforward, but perhaps you could explain to us maybe how your customers are building this into their budgets? Is it taking away from other categories? Is it replacing some things? What have been the conversations in the field and the way that they are actually justifying this? And then I have a follow-up.\nPatrick Smith: Yes. Great. So all these new services is we look at developing them upfront. We first asked ourselves is this solving a valuable problem that our customers will see great value in. And then we also look at, okay, where will the funding for these come from? So you mentioned VR. So that\u2019s a great example. Especially with our international customers, we\u2019ve been looking at this very closely where the training costs associated with the TASER rollout can actually be several times greater than the cost of all the hardware in terms of logistics of bringing officers in, backfilling when they are off the street, all the time and effort that goes into it. And with VR, we\u2019re going to be able to dramatically streamline the training of officers by creating virtual training spaces, where a lot of it could happen without direct even human oversight from an instructor as they are learning the base its skills. We need a lot of repetition in. So for example, right now, agencies may fire somewhere between 6 and a maximum of maybe 18 cartridges per year. We compare that to the thousands of bullets that they hire. But with VR, they can fire unlimited numbers of rounds. So our anticipation is by next year, every office are going through TASER certification training, will fire over 100 cartridges in VR, really building all the muscle memory and the skill and we will be able to do it in a much more time-efficient way, and we can distribute that training. So for example, a lot of this training, including better recurrent training can happen out at the precinct level or the station level rather than having to bring officers into centralized training locations. If I look at some of the things we\u2019re doing around, for example, some of our AI services around transcription, for example, many of our customers, for example, in Canada, have to provide transcripts of every piece of evidence that is submitted, particularly in murder cases and I believe in other high-level felony type cases. So our ability to provide a machine transcript that\u2019s linked in with the video greatly reduces the amount of time. And we think over time, we will be able to get to a point where there will be no need for human intervention. So everything that we\u2019re doing is designed to create value that will find a place somewhere where we\u2019re displacing inefficiency in the current budget or in some cases, competing products like what we did with our ALPR service, that historically, agencies might pay $18,000 to $20,000 per vehicle to put a bespoke ALPR dedicated hardware camera system. We\u2019ve turned that into a virtualized service offering, which just sits as a layer on top of our existing in-car camera. So our in-car camera is cost competitive, all on its own and provides really great value. And now they can choose to turn on ALPR just as a software service layer running on top. So I hope that\u2019s helpful. Just in general, as we\u2019re looking at all of these we both make sure we\u2019re solving problems that are valuable to solve and that there is a path for the budget to either come from increased efficiency, reduce costs or displacing some existing competitors.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you for that. And then for a follow-up, it\u2019s for Josh. You talked about international bookings really ramping up and I was hoping you can kind of give us a bit more color and context in terms of what your international customers are buying? Are they buying fleet TASERS, body cameras? And how are they consuming everything? Are they assuming it within a bundle, or are they consuming it all kind of a la carte one by one product by product?\nJosh Isner: Yes. Thanks for the question, Sami. I think our strategy is really unchanged. It\u2019s one of landing and expanding. So we\u2019re \u2013 there are some customers that start on the body cam side, and they say, hey, this is the number one problem we\u2019re looking to solve right now. Then over time, our job is to make them really successful in their first deployment, and then evangelize our other products to in tandem with the body camera. And in a lot of cases, probably more commonly in international start on the TASER side and build a lot of trust and drive great results and then have kind of earned the right to sell other products in our product portfolio in. And so I think it\u2019s a healthy mix of those things. It usually starts with one of those two core products. And I think what you\u2019re seeing is some early signs that customers are getting a little more open to cloud internationally, which is exciting, but that will be a long-term process to move kind of major federal governments of these international customers over to cloud. And we\u2019re seeing more openness to deploy our next-generation TASER devices as well. So team is doing a great job executing, certainly playing the long game internationally, and there\u2019ll be some really exciting quarters where we have double-digit or triple-digit bookings growth, and then there\u2019ll be others that are kind of more par for the course along the way. But when we add them all up at the end of the year, we\u2019re really excited about the year-over-year growth that we will see internationally.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Next up, Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs.\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. It was encouraging to see the strong fleet sales in the quarter. And I have two questions there. First, is there a better way to understand the sharp inflection in those fleet sales despite the fact that Fleet 3 was launched 2 years ago, it\u2019d be helpful to understand not only for fleet but also to potentially just better understand how purchase dynamics may impact how to think about BodyCam 4 and TASER 10. Thanks. And I have a follow-up.\nJosh Isner: Yes. Absolutely, Mike. Thank you very much for the question. We\u2019re excited about fleet, and we see \u2013 we talk about this from time to time, but 5 or 6 years ago when we launched Fleet 1 might have even been a little longer back than that, is really a body camera attached to a windshield. And we learned a lot. We built Fleet 2, which got us to kind of parity in the market. And then Fleet 3 was a product that kind of accelerated us into a market leadership position. And so there is couple of different dynamics there on the ramp of Fleet 3, one of which is just growing demand for next generation in-car video, company by ALPR and we continue to that and feel great about that. Part of it is where customers were in existing upgrade cycles with Fleet 2 that led to a slower ramp and then a steeper climb or a steeper adoption later. Then another one is just the supply chain environment we\u2019ve been in the last \u2013 been in the last few years. Fleet 3 is relying on third-party hardware. And the supply chain team at Axon has just done a fantastic job navigating the COVID supply chain challenges. But now we\u2019re seeing the supply chains opening up and we\u2019re able to deploy more at a faster clip to customers. So I think it\u2019s a healthy mix of those. Maybe a distant fourth would be when customers have to upgrade systems across hundreds of police cars that they use every day, just their requirements for how they do that over certain time frames, can be one that\u2019s a little back-end loaded as well for each of those deployments. So we manage things but we certainly think fleet will continue to scale throughout the next couple of years, and we\u2019re really proud of the team for delivering such an awesome product to our customers.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you for the very comprehensive answer. And then the follow-up would be, could you just talk about how to think about the translation between fleet sales into Axon cloud growth. Are there any lagged effects to the benefit to cloud or ways to think about how much of the Fleet 3 sales are upgrades versus growth in the installed base does that even matter as we try to think about how that translates into Axon cloud.\nJosh Isner: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s really just our hardware strategy paying off, right? Like we really believe that what we\u2019re building at Axon is a network of connected hardware devices, whether they are on the officer\u2019s body in the police car, on the officer\u2019s belt in the skies in the case of Axon Air and so forth. And so whenever we launch a very competitive hardware platform, the biggest value proposition of any one of those products is it connects to the rest of your evidence in ecosystem that you use day-to-day as a police officer or a police administrator. And so that\u2019s really the magic of Fleet 3 is it just \u2013 it\u2019s one more thing that plugs into this network that you already use day-to-day. And it leads to a fantastic customer experience. I think this was very much an existing market that we entered into and had to compete against a lot of established incumbents and that took some time. But as we\u2019re really thrilled to be the market leader in this category, and now it\u2019s about distancing ourselves even more.\nMike Ng: Thank you for your thoughts.\nAndrea James: Mike, the only thing I add, Josh\u2019s answer was very comprehensive, but I think tactically a little bit what you\u2019re seeing this year is that we now have the supply of fleet that we need, and so we\u2019re able to start fulfilling some of that demand. The only thing that\u2019s really limiting us at this point is how fast we can actually get those cameras installed, which is why we called out the professional services component of just how fast can we get them out and installed at our customer. And then that\u2019s really what will trigger being able to turn on the higher-margin cloud revenue is getting the cameras installed and up running at the customer.\nJeff Kunins: One last kind of thing to add there and ties back to what Rick was saying before. In addition to the price inversion that ALPR made for making this broad available versus the traditional peer expensive on a handful of cars thing. What this does, when a department adopts Fleet 3 with ALPR and respond that turns every car all day every day into a cloud software use case. Where all day, every day, every car across their entire fleet and across their entire city, those vehicles and those cameras are being used as active sensors connected to cloud software to help power the results they are getting. So that further reinforces their connection to the value they are getting out of our overall ecosystem.\nMike Ng: Thank you, Jeff.\nAndrea James: Thanks, Mike. Josh Reilly at Needham. Go ahead.\nJosh Reilly: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. How should we think about the backlog for TASER 10 post Accelerate? I was able to speak with some customers there at the event who were thinking about buying the 7, but they were then evaluating whether to switch to the 10. Is that something that you are seeing coming out of the conference? And is there any implication for the model here for the balance of the year from that?\nJosh Isner: Yes. Josh, as Rick said in his remarks, it does take a little time once we announce a TASER for trials and evaluations to take place. And so you see a little bit of a lag between the interest in the demand and the purchasing. But the good news for us is this is the seventh or eighth time we\u2019ve been through this. We\u2019ve worked through this. We understand what the puts and takes are. We understand how to communicate with customers on this project plan and on how they evaluate and what the timing is. But I think in the back half of the year, you\u2019ll see a really striking kind of demand \u2013 or I\u2019m sorry, sales growth in TASER 10, and that will continue for the next several years. We feel fantastic about the product market fit. We feel fantastic about the customer reaction to the product. And now it\u2019s on us to just manage the upgrade cycle from TASER 7 to TASER 10, and we have a lot of confidence that we will be able to do that very effectively.\nJosh Reilly: Awesome. Great to hear. And then could we get an update on the Axon Records pipeline? And maybe highlight some \u2013 what are some of the key product development priorities for records here near-term? And then is there any profile in terms of customer size or any other characteristics that\u2019s adopting the platform kind of fully from their legacy system and moving on?\nJosh Isner: Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the pipeline, and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Jeff to talk about the feature set and some of the differentiators and investments just in the pipeline where we\u2019ve got a 2- to 3-year view of customers that are looking to deploy Axon Records. And part of that is our motion of selling it as part of the Officer Safety Plan and bundle. And I want to give Brian Wheeler and the entire Axon Records team a huge shout out for \u2013 we talk about responding to adversity and building really mentally tough teams. I don\u2019t know that there is a better example of this at Axon and the records team hearing a lot of early feedback at times complaints early on in the product\u2019s life cycle. And now we just \u2013 we see this as the thing that allows us to become the operating system of public safety for the long-term. And \u2013 so we\u2019re very confident in the demand and our ability to deploy customers over the next several years to get closer to a market leadership position there.\nJeff Kunins: Totally. So just on the numbers, right now, actually deployed, we\u2019ve got nearly 60 agencies that represent nearly 20,000 sworn officers who are live on at least one module of Axon Records, and that includes 17 agencies out of today that are already fully transitioned to use \u2013 to replace their entirely their legacy RMS. And that already includes some great major cities such as Tucson, Baltimore, Virginia Beach and Fresno with more coming soon. So we feel fantastic about the case of adoption that we\u2019ve got, as Josh said, both in the pipeline as well as what\u2019s already deployed and this overall strategy of getting agencies to get going with at least one module of records, which then very, very frequently transitioned to them wanting to adopt the full product for their \u2013 to replace their entire legacy RMS. And you heard me talk when I first joined the company nearly 4 years ago that this was going to be a long journey, but we were confident that over time, exactly as Josh said, we\u2019d be positioned to become the clear leader in this space and both on the strength of the product itself, but again, on its connections and inherent coherence with the rest of the Axon ecosystem, and that\u2019s one of the things that our customers value the most as we sell in.\nJosh Reilly: Awesome. Thanks guys. Fun to see the success on that product there.\nJosh Isner: Thanks, Josh.\nPatrick Smith: Thank you very much.\nAndrea James: Will Power at Baird.\nWill Power: Okay. Great. Yes, I\u2019ll try to a couple of questions. I guess, first, it would be great to get any kind of early feedback you\u2019re receiving on AB 4. What are some of the features, officers are most excited about? And what\u2019s kind of the feedback you\u2019re getting on the bidirectional voice capability? I mean is that something they are really going to utilize? Do they think they are utilized, they won\u2019t utilize, I\u2019d just be curious kind of what you\u2019re hearing so far?\nJeff Kunins: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So as you saw in the video and a bit in the shareholder letter, it\u2019s, of course, early days, but we\u2019re incredibly excited about the initial response both from customers, perspective customers hearing about it and accelerate as well as the customers that are actively trialing it. So far, there is both the meat and potatoes things of our best ever battery life and sensor and all of those things, there is the return of the POV accessory and having it unified with the court camera in a way that we have never had before. There is a ton of excitement for both of those things. And then on the comp side, you\u2019ve heard us talking about respond for multiple years now in the growing really, really healthy, both sales and adoption of that in the field, even when there is only been the one way, they are consuming streams up until now. And as agencies are trialing and talking about the bidirectional, we\u2019re getting a lot of enthusiasm for what that makes possible, and in particular, a lot of excitement for this idea of the dedicated Watch Me button on the camera. And the reason why we think we\u2019re getting a lot of excitement for that is, as you heard in the video and from Rick, it inverts the control or the perceived control and puts it right in the hands of the individual officer, it makes the conversation for an officer being, hey, if I need help, if I want someone to watch my back, I can request that, and that creates a proactive signal to command staff, support staff, whoever it is, encouraging the and asking them to jump in on that right now as opposed to today\u2019s live streaming, which requires someone to be deciding to be passively watching and deciding to go in or with signal alerts like that might come in from time to time. So there is a lot of excitement about all of that. And overall, we expect it to keep ramping just as response has over the past couple of years.\nPatrick Smith: Yes. I\u2019ll jump in with one of my favorite quotes from science fiction author, William Gibson, who says the future is here, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed. Live streaming when we introduced it a few years ago was a totally new concept. And my tech when we first launched body cameras, this is in an industry where new concepts take a little while to really take hold. But there is one agency in Texas called the Texas Medical Center. We had the chief up during my teeno. He is now live streaming every call for service into dispatch, and his results have been just phenomenal. Imagine just for a moment that you\u2019re a police dispatcher in today\u2019s world you\u2019re probably supporting five different calls happening with 10 to 15 different officers. You\u2019ve got to keep track of what\u2019s happening largely through these cryptic radio messages on a shared channel with the officers you\u2019re managing as well as what other people are managing. And you have very little idea about what\u2019s actually happening at these calls. And then flip to a different world where as you\u2019re doing this, you can have a screen where you can see visually what\u2019s happening for all those officers. And it turns out that our visual system is highly tuned to notice things that are abnormal or out of the ordinary. For example, you are sitting next to somebody on an airplane, right. None of us want to you to creepy person reading the phone of person next to us. And you don\u2019t notice it when there is text is going on, but if they get some photo or something, they will just grab your attention. And even though it\u2019s far in your periphery, you immediately who, I don\u2019t even mean to invade this person precut your visual system is really good at that. Well, now if you are a dispatcher, what we are hearing from TMC is that these officers or the dispatchers are rapidly able to wait a minute, something doesn\u2019t look right with what\u2019s happening here, and they will then tune in and focus. They may call for a supervisor to tune in live, they will dispatch additional resources. In some cases, they are helping officers. One of them noticed somebody who would been in a different call, who then gave that officer of fake ID or a false name. So, I have high confidence that in another 5 years to 10 years, the idea of trying to run a police department with only radio voice traffic is going to see just crazy once you can do this with audio and video and more sophisticated integration of sensors. And we believe we are really on the kind of the edge book clubs we made the decision with AB3 to put LTE into every camera and then allow that to start iterating together with our customers to learn about these new use cases. So, the two-way voice, once you can see a video, the next thing frequently you want to do is communicate with that person and not have to do it over a radio that air traffic is very tightly controlled. It\u2019s not one-on-one. You can\u2019t have a rich conversation. You have to use cryptic codes because you are also transmitting to 15 or 20 other people that aren\u2019t involved in that conversation. So, we are still early in AB4 rolling out, but we think the feature set hits both the transformative new capability and then some simple things like some people love to have the head mounted camera, some like to mount it on the shoulder, many officers prefer the body camera. Those have always been two separate SKUs where you couldn\u2019t reconfigure them. We now have one SKU where we can reconfigure if you go from SWAT to patrol or wherever you can now have many mounting options, and the ability to recharge while you are in the car with a magnetic disconnect map gives us effectively infinite battery life. So, we think this has been a great combination of both transformative and just continuing to deliver on the basics.\nWill Power: That\u2019s great. Thanks for that. If I can get a question in for Brittany on free cash flow, has some impacts in the quarter, I think more so than we have seen in the past years. So, any other color there? Just maybe any thoughts just on the free cash flow outlook for the year?\nBrittany Bagley: More than what we shared, I wouldn\u2019t say it changes any of my view in terms of our ability to generate free cash flow over the course of the year. We just had some strong seasonality in Q1 in terms of uses of cash, including bonus, commissions, some timing around, permitting stock taxes for stock options, and a little bit of inventory, but mostly some of those more one-time items.\nWill Power: Okay. So, cadence of the year is we will see that price step back beginning in Q2, I suppose, and\u2026\nBrittany Bagley: Yes. I think you will still see good healthy free cash flow for the year.\nWill Power: Okay. Thank you.\nBrittany Bagley: Of course. Thanks.\nAndrea James: So I\u2019m going to read Keith Housum\u2019s question, allowed. He is in a public place with bad background noise. So, Keith Housum at Northcoast asking, can we provide an update on VR in terms of modules growth, geographic availability, number of users over the past year and our goals for 2023.\nJosh Isner: Sure. I can start there, and maybe Rick can fill any blanks in. The \u2013 I don\u2019t think we are ready quite yet to talk about user growth in VR or any kind of detailed financials on the product line. Instead, we are really focused on building a platform here for training police officers at a much higher quality well into the future. And so for us, it\u2019s really about, hey, how do we have the foundation built with the skills needed in terms of training between the TASER, a firearm and verbal communication in our community engagement modules. And over time, what you will see is you will see more specific scenario-based modules being released to the market. In order to start, it will be in the U.S., but we are more rapidly integrating scenarios from some of our growing markets such as international and Federal in corrections and otherwise. But again, the foundation of the product has to be very solid between the sensors the officers use and the software that accompanies the experience for the trainers themselves. And so just like with our other products, whether TASER, body camera fleet, it\u2019s about getting the basics right first and then moving quickly once we have that platform very solidly built. And so we continue to be excited about the bookings we are seeing in VR. It\u2019s one of our fastest growing products ever. And we expect that trend to continue for the long-term, but we want to make sure we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves and really do things right from the ground up.\nAndrea James: Okay. And we have four more analysts in the queue and we are going to try to get to everybody, today. Jonathan Ho at William Blair. Go ahead Jonathan.\nJonathan Ho: I will just stick to one question, just to keep things probing. Can you help us maybe understand some of I guess the gross margin dynamics around some of your newer products, and maybe how you expect that to trend over the course of the year?\nBrittany Bagley: Yes. No, I appreciate that. So, we have really called out gross margins as probably being very similar to Q1. And if they improve, it will be only slightly. So, we are really expecting that to be the dynamic for the rest of the year. A couple of things that really go into that are this continued revenue mix that we are seeing from fleet and the growth we are seeing in fleet inherently has a lower margin upfront, plus we have professional services to get it installed. So, that\u2019s an impact to us, which will be a benefit over time. This continued growth in our software revenue over time will be a tailwind, but this year, it is a mix impact for us. And then I would say we would expect as we continue to ramp in T10 to see that improve towards the back half of the year like we were talking about, but that will be offset with some of these fleet dynamics.\nAndrea James: Jeremy Hamblin from Craig-Hallum.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks. And my congratulations to Rick and the team on this milestone of being at the S&P 500. It\u2019s a pretty amazing journey over the last \u2013 where you guys were 15 years ago. I wanted to ask just about your ARR, which is up nearly 50%. I think probably like the fastest growth on a year-over-year basis, maybe in the company\u2019s history, but certainly in the last 5 years. And you provided a little bit of color in the release on that, but just wanted to see if you could add a little bit more in terms of the dynamics between booked seats versus ARPU. You talked about premium packages that you are getting clients to sign up for. But I wanted to see if you could share a little bit more color around that and how we should be thinking about with your product launches around TASER 10, AB4, I imagine you will be getting some higher bundled packages on a go-forward basis. But any color you could share on that.\nBrittany Bagley: Yes. I mean I will jump in and then maybe, Josh, we will see if Josh wants to add to it. But I would say it really is the sort of flywheel taking effect, and so you are starting to see the benefits of that. Certainly, moving some of our customers into our more premium offerings is continuing to benefit us in terms of ARR growth. And then I think you are seeing many, many years of work to get people added into this software and the rep we are seeing from some of the hardware products and to move up the curve started to come to fruition.\nJosh Isner: Yes. The only thing I would add there, and Jeremy, I appreciate all the kind words. Thank you very much, and it\u2019s been fun to have you guys on a lot of these calls for a long time now. But in terms of the ARR growth, it\u2019s really doing two things very well. And I give Jeff a lot of credit for kind of simplifying this upon his entry to Axon a few years ago. So, we got to sell new products to our existing customers, and we got to sell our existing products to new customers. And when we do those things, in parallel very well, you see the types of results that we are seeing now. And so as Brittany said, in our existing markets, getting the flywheel going across OSP, but then supplementing now with great results in Federal and enterprise, and corrections and international, it\u2019s doing those two things in parallel, that\u2019s leading to great an exciting growth.\nJeremy Hamblin: Got it. And just one other follow-up here with the launch of AB4 and TASER 10, any color you can share in terms of the adoption kind of cycle times versus what you have seen in the prior ramps, whether you want to compare it to TASER 7 or AB3 faster, slower, more depth on that, that would be great?\nJosh Isner: Sure. I would say in the TASER business in general, it\u2019s generally a 5-year upgrade cycle. So, when you a launch \u2013 whenever you launch a new TASER device, you see the customers that bought 5-ish years ago as your customers that have the most early interest. And we are seeing that with T10, but the thing we are most excited about, that\u2019s very different from previous generations of the TASER is that customers that are early on or midway through their cycle with TASER 7 are expressing a lot of interest in upgrading early to TASER 10. So, I think that speaks to the kind of the huge improvements in terms of effectiveness, range and so forth that our customers really see and value, and that\u2019s driving them to maybe not only upgrade early, but line up the resources on their end in terms of training to also allow that upgrade to happen on a faster cycle. So, we are very excited and encouraged. Of course, we have got to execute, and we have got to drive that into fruition, but we have got a lot of confidence that our team is capable of doing that.\nPatrick Smith: One anecdote I will share, forgive my enthusiasm, but we had one customer at TASER 10, a midsize is in several hundred officer agency that was sitting in the keynote and called back to their chief and they actually changed in order that was in process, and they got the order through, I believe the Chief Signature and the purchasing department of the city by the end of that day. We have not seen something like that again, I don\u2019t want to get too excited from a projection standpoint, but that reaction to me was just extremely meaningful that they saw this as something that was worth really disrupting the whole process to stop an existing order pivot on a dime and get the new thing approved. And then the other thing I would tell you is where I think TASER 10 make a really huge difference is in the international markets. TASER 10, for the first time, I think we have a weapon that could become the officer\u2019s primary defensive tool, probably not in the U.S. because we live in a country watch in guns and officers need to have their legal weapons. But picked your average European country where police are all wearing pistols in nations that really don\u2019t have a gun crime problem. And previous versions of the TASER weapon probably didn\u2019t have enough capability range, enough shots that you would rely on it as the primary tool to defend yourself. And I think we are now crossing that Rubicon. And I think that can really open up the international markets where we have the opportunity to become the primary defensive tool.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thank you.\nAndrea James: Erik Suppiger at JMP.\nJosh Isner: Erik, it looks like you are on mute.\nErik Suppiger: There we go. Can you hear me? Just kind of a follow-on from what Rick was just saying. You have talked about the international opportunity for TASER as being multiples of the domestic opportunity. As you said you have seen some strength in Europe, can you talk a little bit about the dynamics of how they are adopting your products, is it more of a shift towards the TASER. Is that getting \u2013 is that something that can be a bigger opportunity than the body camera, or what are some of the dynamics in terms of the adoption in Europe?\nJosh Isner: Yes. To start, Erik, I would say it\u2019s really some of the actions we took 3 years or 4 years ago are really just starting to pay off. And in TASER programs regardless of geography or market, it generally starts with a lower number of units that are aimed at a particular use case, whether it\u2019s SWAT or a certain number of users in a police force. But then once they start seeing early success, that\u2019s really when we see the willingness to adopt the much higher quantities. And really, that\u2019s happening in a number of European markets at this point, and that\u2019s driving some of the exciting growth there. And as we start to reap the benefits of that, we also are planting seeds in other markets where they are, for the first time adopting either dozens or low hundreds number of TASER devices. And then in a couple of years, we will see more proliferation there as well. In terms of the relative opportunity, generally, I would still say body cameras are the longer term, the higher TAM only because you have got higher ARPUs associated with our video business versus the TASER at scale. But they are both very, very compelling opportunities in international and my guess is TASERs will move a little faster as we still \u2013 especially in Europe as we still start to evangelize the cloud more and more there. But over the long-term, certainly the body camera and cloud business is very attractive and one that we are really exciting about or excited to continue to grow in some of our international markets.\nErik Suppiger: That\u2019s it. Thank you.\nAndrea James: Okay. Awesome. Paul Chung at JPMorgan. Go ahead Paul.\nPaul Chung: Hi. Can you hear me? Okay. Great. So, thanks for squeezing me in. Just on \u2013 most of the questions have been asked, but just on TASER 10, thanks for all the details on the upgrade cycle. So, the use for \u2013 use case for the upgrade is pretty clear given the effectiveness we got to try to accelerate it is quite easy to use. Can you expand on more of the cartridge volume dynamics? And you mentioned kind of a boost on overall margin profile there. Talk about the magnitude would be helpful as well. And is this more of a gradual ramp in the second half? Thank you.\nJosh Isner: I can probably start with just what the bundle looks like, and then I might hand it over to Brittany to talk more about the cartridge gross margins and the ramp. In the bundle on this product, it\u2019s really important since you have 10 shots in the device to be able to train and thus, that drives training cartridge demand up, and because each shot is an individual shot, I think over time, we will see duty volumes go up as well. So, we have priced all that into the bundle and you can go on the website to look at the relative pricing versus T7, but that contemplates some of the growing cartridge demand. And of course, as we get up to speed with selling high volumes of these, that has implications for us on automation and how fast we are able to ramp our manufacturing, maybe if Brittany has anything to add there on the margin side.\nBrittany Bagley: I think you pretty much nailed it, which is because it\u2019s starting to get bundled in. We are not really thinking about cartridges versus handles separately from a gross margin standpoint. We are really thinking about the full TASER package together. And so as we talk about teaser margins improving as we go through the year and get to the back half of the year. We have sort of \u2013 because that\u2019s bundled together, I would view it as bundled together in our margin outlook as well.\nPaul Chung: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And that\u2019s the dynamic for the Axon, the body cam, the new one as well. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.\nJosh Isner: Yes. Paul, I think on the body cam, the only thing I would add there is, because respond is the thing that drives some of the features in terms of the streaming and communication features in AB4. There, there is a real opportunity to sell more outside of the core body camera hardware and service. And while we are excited about the growth and respond, we see some opportunity there for the volume of respond licenses sold to grow over time as a result of some of the new capabilities of the AB4 hardware.\nAndrea James: Okay. Great. I think that\u2019s everyone. Do we have any follow-ups, I will give it a second. It looks like no. Thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s have Rick close this out.\nPatrick Smith: Awesome. Obviously, excited to be off to a good start, two major new product launches. I think VR, which you guys asked some questions about here was really going to start getting it strived the back half of this year. We have integrated new sensors so that TASER 10 will be first. We will have a really fine-tuned, very smooth, integrated product experience. TASER 7 will follow, and then we will start rolling out various firearms and other platforms. So, we think we are really setting the right stage with these two new products and this progress towards our moonshot to continue to sell value-added premium services and to really go wide with VR. By next year, we think that will be common for pretty much every officer, and instructor who is getting trained on TASER that we believe VR can become the standard. And that\u2019s going to create an opportunity for us to then launch a whole lot more content and services through our VR platform. So, Jeff has just been doing a great job with the team, hiring and bringing in great talent to build all of this and then putting together a strategy for how to layer all the hardware and the software pieces. So, we are just really excited to have you shareholders and analysts who have been of our journey. And we are just getting started. We got an exciting 10-year march ahead of us to cut gun related deaths in half, and I am confident we are going to do it. So, with that, we will see you all next at our shareholder meeting and then at our next quarterly results, I have to wrap up Q2. So, thanks everybody, and have a great night.",

            "content": "One last kind of thing to add there and ties back to what Rick was saying before. In addition to the price inversion that ALPR made for making this broad available versus the traditional peer expensive on a handful of cars thing. What this does, when a department adopts Fleet 3 with ALPR and respond that turns every car all day every day into a cloud software use case. Where all day, every day, every car across their entire fleet and across their entire city, those vehicles and those cameras are being used as active sensors connected to cloud software to help power the results they are getting. So that further reinforces their connection to the value they are getting out of our overall ecosystem. Totally. So just on the numbers, right now, actually deployed, we've got nearly 60 agencies that represent nearly 20,000 sworn officers who are live on at least one module of Axon Records, and that includes 17 agencies out of today that are already fully transitioned to use \u2013 to replace their entirely their legacy RMS. And that already includes some great major cities such as Tucson, Baltimore, Virginia Beach and Fresno with more coming soon. So we feel fantastic about the case of adoption that we've got, as Josh said, both in the pipeline as well as what's already deployed and this overall strategy of getting agencies to get going with at least one module of records, which then very, very frequently transitioned to them wanting to adopt the full product for their \u2013 to replace their entire legacy RMS. And you heard me talk when I first joined the company nearly 4 years ago that this was going to be a long journey, but we were confident that over time, exactly as Josh said, we'd be positioned to become the clear leader in this space and both on the strength of the product itself, but again, on its connections and inherent coherence with the rest of the Axon ecosystem, and that's one of the things that our customers value the most as we sell in. Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So as you saw in the video and a bit in the shareholder letter, it's, of course, early days, but we're incredibly excited about the initial response both from customers, perspective customers hearing about it and accelerate as well as the customers that are actively trialing it. So far, there is both the meat and potatoes things of our best ever battery life and sensor and all of those things, there is the return of the POV accessory and having it unified with the court camera in a way that we have never had before. There is a ton of excitement for both of those things. And then on the comp side, you've heard us talking about respond for multiple years now in the growing really, really healthy, both sales and adoption of that in the field, even when there is only been the one way, they are consuming streams up until now. And as agencies are trialing and talking about the bidirectional, we're getting a lot of enthusiasm for what that makes possible, and in particular, a lot of excitement for this idea of the dedicated Watch Me button on the camera. And the reason why we think we're getting a lot of excitement for that is, as you heard in the video and from Rick, it inverts the control or the perceived control and puts it right in the hands of the individual officer, it makes the conversation for an officer being, hey, if I need help, if I want someone to watch my back, I can request that, and that creates a proactive signal to command staff, support staff, whoever it is, encouraging the and asking them to jump in on that right now as opposed to today's live streaming, which requires someone to be deciding to be passively watching and deciding to go in or with signal alerts like that might come in from time to time. So there is a lot of excitement about all of that. And overall, we expect it to keep ramping just as response has over the past couple of years."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Rick. Enthusiasm from our customers has been infectious. What really moves me is when our customers see our passion and they become a part of it. Our annual Accelerate conference this year was the biggest and best we ever hosted. When customers tell me that we are motivating them and changing the way they approach their jobs for the better, I know we are doing our job. We see a strong and growing demand pipeline for 2023 and beyond, and we remain focused on doing our best work. In February, I spoke about 4 areas of focus for 2023 and I am pleased to report we are executing well on each of these objectives. Our number one operational focus is revenue. Top line growth remains a priority. We grow our business so that we can invest and deliver more value to the market. Our investments are paying off. We grew the top line 34% year-over-year in Q1, achieving a record quarterly revenue for the company. Our cloud business grew 51% year-over-year, and it's remarkable to reflect that just a few years ago, cloud applications were nearly unheard of in public safety. We've been proud to evangelize public safety cloud adoption in the U.S., and we will continue to do so globally. Our Taser weapons business grew 17% year-over-year, and most of that was tied to continuing strong demand of our TASER 7 platform. We are only in the early stages of shipping our newest product, TASER 10, which is seeing the strongest initial demand of any TASER weapon in the history of the economy. I have seen several TASER product launches at Axon and customer enthusiasm for TASER 10 trumps any previous model. Our second operational focus is profitability, which we measure by adjusted EBITDA margin. Brittany will take you through the details in a minute, but at a high level, I'm pleased with our performance in Q1. Number three, new market expansion. In the first quarter, our international booking grew double digits, driven by nearly 100% year-over-year bookings growth in Europe. And we also saw triple-digit bookings growth in our Justice segment, an emerging market for us. We've invested heavily in our sales force and continue to support new capabilities in these new markets, and we're seeing leverage from these investments. Finally, number four, new product adoption, we are tirelessly investing to ensure that the products we build continue to be adopted by our customers. We saw double-digit bookings growth in a number of our emerging product categories, including ALPR, air and virtual reality. The foundation underpinning all of these priorities is our ability to attract and then retain world-class talent. We cannot accomplish any of this without the help of a team who brings financial discipline, a next play mindset and the skill sets to launch us through the stratosphere of our moonshot journey. We enjoy high employee retention rates, which outperformed tech averages, and this is a testament to our mission and our ability to focus on solving real problems. In sum, we executed strongly in Q1, have launched into two new products. Our pipeline is solid and we have line of sight to a very strong back half. I'm proud of our team for driving such a strong start to the year, but I am even more proud that they have quickly turned the page and are focused on sustaining the momentum in Q2 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brittany to take us through our financials in more detail. Thanks a lot. Yes, absolutely. And just to add to that, we never want to get out over our skis on guidance. I think certainly, there are paths to outperforming guidance and like we are working towards those. But until we see that actually materialize in the pipeline and a way we can feel a lot of confidence in, it's important to be measured as to how we look at the data we have today. And so certainly, the focus is delivering as good of a year revenue-wise as we can, and we feel confident that we have the team to do that and on top of that, in terms of how we build in new products into our bundles and offerings. I think those are actually the opportune times to rewrite a lot of contracts. And so whenever there's a new product that comes out either a flagship product like a TASER, new TASER CW or a new body camera or something like a new software offering that gives us the opportunity to go back to those customers and demo those products and as customers kind of value them, they start asking questions about, hey, how do we build this into our contract and that leads to conversations about upgrading the bundle or adding on to the bundle. So those are great opportunities for our sales team to rewrite these contracts for the longer term. So that's how we look at kind of new product introduction into the sales process. Yes. Thanks for the question, Sami. I think our strategy is really unchanged. It's one of landing and expanding. So we're \u2013 there are some customers that start on the body cam side, and they say, hey, this is the number one problem we're looking to solve right now. Then over time, our job is to make them really successful in their first deployment, and then evangelize our other products to in tandem with the body camera. And in a lot of cases, probably more commonly in international start on the TASER side and build a lot of trust and drive great results and then have kind of earned the right to sell other products in our product portfolio in. And so I think it's a healthy mix of those things. It usually starts with one of those two core products. And I think what you're seeing is some early signs that customers are getting a little more open to cloud internationally, which is exciting, but that will be a long-term process to move kind of major federal governments of these international customers over to cloud. And we're seeing more openness to deploy our next-generation TASER devices as well. So team is doing a great job executing, certainly playing the long game internationally, and there'll be some really exciting quarters where we have double-digit or triple-digit bookings growth, and then there'll be others that are kind of more par for the course along the way. But when we add them all up at the end of the year, we're really excited about the year-over-year growth that we will see internationally. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. Thank you very much for the question. We're excited about fleet, and we see \u2013 we talk about this from time to time, but 5 or 6 years ago when we launched Fleet 1 might have even been a little longer back than that, is really a body camera attached to a windshield. And we learned a lot. We built Fleet 2, which got us to kind of parity in the market. And then Fleet 3 was a product that kind of accelerated us into a market leadership position. And so there is couple of different dynamics there on the ramp of Fleet 3, one of which is just growing demand for next generation in-car video, company by ALPR and we continue to that and feel great about that. Part of it is where customers were in existing upgrade cycles with Fleet 2 that led to a slower ramp and then a steeper climb or a steeper adoption later. Then another one is just the supply chain environment we've been in the last \u2013 been in the last few years. Fleet 3 is relying on third-party hardware. And the supply chain team at Axon has just done a fantastic job navigating the COVID supply chain challenges. But now we're seeing the supply chains opening up and we're able to deploy more at a faster clip to customers. So I think it's a healthy mix of those. Maybe a distant fourth would be when customers have to upgrade systems across hundreds of police cars that they use every day, just their requirements for how they do that over certain time frames, can be one that's a little back-end loaded as well for each of those deployments. So we manage things but we certainly think fleet will continue to scale throughout the next couple of years, and we're really proud of the team for delivering such an awesome product to our customers. Yes, it's a great question. It's really just our hardware strategy paying off, right? Like we really believe that what we're building at Axon is a network of connected hardware devices, whether they are on the officer's body in the police car, on the officer's belt in the skies in the case of Axon Air and so forth. And so whenever we launch a very competitive hardware platform, the biggest value proposition of any one of those products is it connects to the rest of your evidence in ecosystem that you use day-to-day as a police officer or a police administrator. And so that's really the magic of Fleet 3 is it just \u2013 it's one more thing that plugs into this network that you already use day-to-day. And it leads to a fantastic customer experience. I think this was very much an existing market that we entered into and had to compete against a lot of established incumbents and that took some time. But as we're really thrilled to be the market leader in this category, and now it's about distancing ourselves even more. Yes. Josh, as Rick said in his remarks, it does take a little time once we announce a TASER for trials and evaluations to take place. And so you see a little bit of a lag between the interest in the demand and the purchasing. But the good news for us is this is the seventh or eighth time we've been through this. We've worked through this. We understand what the puts and takes are. We understand how to communicate with customers on this project plan and on how they evaluate and what the timing is. But I think in the back half of the year, you'll see a really striking kind of demand \u2013 or I'm sorry, sales growth in TASER 10, and that will continue for the next several years. We feel fantastic about the product market fit. We feel fantastic about the customer reaction to the product. And now it's on us to just manage the upgrade cycle from TASER 7 to TASER 10, and we have a lot of confidence that we will be able to do that very effectively. Sure. Maybe I'll start with the pipeline, and then I'll pass it over to Jeff to talk about the feature set and some of the differentiators and investments just in the pipeline where we've got a 2- to 3-year view of customers that are looking to deploy Axon Records. And part of that is our motion of selling it as part of the Officer Safety Plan and bundle. And I want to give Brian Wheeler and the entire Axon Records team a huge shout out for \u2013 we talk about responding to adversity and building really mentally tough teams. I don't know that there is a better example of this at Axon and the records team hearing a lot of early feedback at times complaints early on in the product's life cycle. And now we just \u2013 we see this as the thing that allows us to become the operating system of public safety for the long-term. And \u2013 so we're very confident in the demand and our ability to deploy customers over the next several years to get closer to a market leadership position there. Thanks, Josh. Sure. I can start there, and maybe Rick can fill any blanks in. The \u2013 I don't think we are ready quite yet to talk about user growth in VR or any kind of detailed financials on the product line. Instead, we are really focused on building a platform here for training police officers at a much higher quality well into the future. And so for us, it's really about, hey, how do we have the foundation built with the skills needed in terms of training between the TASER, a firearm and verbal communication in our community engagement modules. And over time, what you will see is you will see more specific scenario-based modules being released to the market. In order to start, it will be in the U.S., but we are more rapidly integrating scenarios from some of our growing markets such as international and Federal in corrections and otherwise. But again, the foundation of the product has to be very solid between the sensors the officers use and the software that accompanies the experience for the trainers themselves. And so just like with our other products, whether TASER, body camera fleet, it's about getting the basics right first and then moving quickly once we have that platform very solidly built. And so we continue to be excited about the bookings we are seeing in VR. It's one of our fastest growing products ever. And we expect that trend to continue for the long-term, but we want to make sure we don't get ahead of ourselves and really do things right from the ground up. Yes. The only thing I would add there, and Jeremy, I appreciate all the kind words. Thank you very much, and it's been fun to have you guys on a lot of these calls for a long time now. But in terms of the ARR growth, it's really doing two things very well. And I give Jeff a lot of credit for kind of simplifying this upon his entry to Axon a few years ago. So, we got to sell new products to our existing customers, and we got to sell our existing products to new customers. And when we do those things, in parallel very well, you see the types of results that we are seeing now. And so as Brittany said, in our existing markets, getting the flywheel going across OSP, but then supplementing now with great results in Federal and enterprise, and corrections and international, it's doing those two things in parallel, that's leading to great an exciting growth. Sure. I would say in the TASER business in general, it's generally a 5-year upgrade cycle. So, when you a launch \u2013 whenever you launch a new TASER device, you see the customers that bought 5-ish years ago as your customers that have the most early interest. And we are seeing that with T10, but the thing we are most excited about, that's very different from previous generations of the TASER is that customers that are early on or midway through their cycle with TASER 7 are expressing a lot of interest in upgrading early to TASER 10. So, I think that speaks to the kind of the huge improvements in terms of effectiveness, range and so forth that our customers really see and value, and that's driving them to maybe not only upgrade early, but line up the resources on their end in terms of training to also allow that upgrade to happen on a faster cycle. So, we are very excited and encouraged. Of course, we have got to execute, and we have got to drive that into fruition, but we have got a lot of confidence that our team is capable of doing that. Erik, it looks like you are on mute. Yes. To start, Erik, I would say it's really some of the actions we took 3 years or 4 years ago are really just starting to pay off. And in TASER programs regardless of geography or market, it generally starts with a lower number of units that are aimed at a particular use case, whether it's SWAT or a certain number of users in a police force. But then once they start seeing early success, that's really when we see the willingness to adopt the much higher quantities. And really, that's happening in a number of European markets at this point, and that's driving some of the exciting growth there. And as we start to reap the benefits of that, we also are planting seeds in other markets where they are, for the first time adopting either dozens or low hundreds number of TASER devices. And then in a couple of years, we will see more proliferation there as well. In terms of the relative opportunity, generally, I would still say body cameras are the longer term, the higher TAM only because you have got higher ARPUs associated with our video business versus the TASER at scale. But they are both very, very compelling opportunities in international and my guess is TASERs will move a little faster as we still \u2013 especially in Europe as we still start to evangelize the cloud more and more there. But over the long-term, certainly the body camera and cloud business is very attractive and one that we are really exciting about or excited to continue to grow in some of our international markets. I can probably start with just what the bundle looks like, and then I might hand it over to Brittany to talk more about the cartridge gross margins and the ramp. In the bundle on this product, it's really important since you have 10 shots in the device to be able to train and thus, that drives training cartridge demand up, and because each shot is an individual shot, I think over time, we will see duty volumes go up as well. So, we have priced all that into the bundle and you can go on the website to look at the relative pricing versus T7, but that contemplates some of the growing cartridge demand. And of course, as we get up to speed with selling high volumes of these, that has implications for us on automation and how fast we are able to ramp our manufacturing, maybe if Brittany has anything to add there on the margin side. Yes. Paul, I think on the body cam, the only thing I would add there is, because respond is the thing that drives some of the features in terms of the streaming and communication features in AB4. There, there is a real opportunity to sell more outside of the core body camera hardware and service. And while we are excited about the growth and respond, we see some opportunity there for the volume of respond licenses sold to grow over time as a result of some of the new capabilities of the AB4 hardware."

            "content": "Thank you, Josh. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, reflecting broad-based strength across our business. Our top line growth of almost 34% year-over-year supported by 51% growth in our cloud business continues to demonstrate the value of our offering. Given Q1 performance, we are confident in our outlook and raising our revenue growth rate from 20% to 22% for the year. On gross margin, we had some sequential headwinds in Q1 coming from revenue mix as we grew Axon Fleet sales and the professional services associated with those and did repeat the gross margin benefit of catch-up software revenue that we saw in Q4 of \u201822. Gross margin also reflects an impact of onetime items related to inventory and other cost adjustments. Over the remaining quarters of \u201823, we expect fleet demand to remain strong. And as a result, we would expect gross margins to remain approximately flat or improve only modestly from Q1 level. To double-click on the impact of fleet, demand for Fleet 3 has consistently exceeded our expectations since we began shipping in 2021. Our fleet business carries a lower margin upfront and transitions to high-margin recurring software revenue over time. In the first quarter, for example, fleet revenue grew 139% year-over-year. Fulfilling this demand solidifies our market leadership and sets us up for long-term success. When our customers buy more of our hardware, they are also investing in our broader ecosystem of high-margin software offering. We also continue to invest in automation and improving our manufacturing efficiency, and we're pleased to see the supply chain stabilizing in 2023 as expected. Over time, these efforts along with ongoing growth in our high-margin software business should continue to benefit gross margins. Regarding operating expenses, R&D investment remains a priority to support our long-term revenue growth. We continue to digest SG&A investments we made over the past year and are balancing OpEx discipline with the investments needed to scale our business to $2 billion in revenue and beyond. As we had anticipated, travel expenses have also increased as everyone returns to in-person meetings and events. I am pleased to upwardly revise our outlook. We are increasing our full year revenue range of $1.44 billion to $1.46 billion, representing 22% year-over-year revenue growth at the midpoint. We continue to target full year adjusted EBITDA margins of 20%, implying a range of $288 million to $292 million. We remain focused on delivering on both our near-term and long-term financial commitments. In addition to the above, these include free cash flow, moving towards long-term sustainable equity dilution, responsible management of our balance sheet and continuing to support our partner ecosystem. All of these are in great shape exiting Q1. Longer term, we continue to focus on delivering on our top line growth while expanding our gross margins leveraging our OpEx and increasing our adjusted EBITDA as we work towards our 2025 target of 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. Great new products, including TASER 10, Axon Body 4, fleet and our software will all continue to support this outlook. I look forward to updating you further on our continued progress next quarter. And with that, I would like to open it up to questions. Maybe I'll take guidance and then turn customers over to Josh. Okay. So as we look at our guidance for the full year, obviously, we're really pleased with our strong Q1 performance. Part of what goes along with introducing new products, though, like TASER 10 and near term for Axon Body 4 as there is a transition period as our customers transition to those new products and are buying less of our existing older products. So as we look at our guidance, we're baking that transition into our guidance we're also baking in the fact that we had a really strong back half of last year, and so the comps get more difficult as we look at the second half. More than what we shared, I wouldn't say it changes any of my view in terms of our ability to generate free cash flow over the course of the year. We just had some strong seasonality in Q1 in terms of uses of cash, including bonus, commissions, some timing around, permitting stock taxes for stock options, and a little bit of inventory, but mostly some of those more one-time items. Yes. I think you will still see good healthy free cash flow for the year. Of course. Thanks. Yes. No, I appreciate that. So, we have really called out gross margins as probably being very similar to Q1. And if they improve, it will be only slightly. So, we are really expecting that to be the dynamic for the rest of the year. A couple of things that really go into that are this continued revenue mix that we are seeing from fleet and the growth we are seeing in fleet inherently has a lower margin upfront, plus we have professional services to get it installed. So, that's an impact to us, which will be a benefit over time. This continued growth in our software revenue over time will be a tailwind, but this year, it is a mix impact for us. And then I would say we would expect as we continue to ramp in T10 to see that improve towards the back half of the year like we were talking about, but that will be offset with some of these fleet dynamics. Yes. I mean I will jump in and then maybe, Josh, we will see if Josh wants to add to it. But I would say it really is the sort of flywheel taking effect, and so you are starting to see the benefits of that. Certainly, moving some of our customers into our more premium offerings is continuing to benefit us in terms of ARR growth. And then I think you are seeing many, many years of work to get people added into this software and the rep we are seeing from some of the hardware products and to move up the curve started to come to fruition. I think you pretty much nailed it, which is because it's starting to get bundled in. We are not really thinking about cartridges versus handles separately from a gross margin standpoint. We are really thinking about the full TASER package together. And so as we talk about teaser margins improving as we go through the year and get to the back half of the year. We have sort of \u2013 because that's bundled together, I would view it as bundled together in our margin outlook as well."

            "name": "Patrick Smith",
            "content": "Alright. Thank you, and great job, Andrea and Angel. Hello, and welcome to our shareholders. We feel great that 2023 is off to a fantastic start after announcing our moonshot goal last year to produce gun related deaths between police and the public by 50% over the next 10 years. We brought to market two major product releases that can serve as the workhorses to help get us there. When we talk about our moonshot goal to cut gun deaths, TASER 10 is our Saturn 5 rocket. And Axon Body 4 is mission control. Customer reception to TASER 10 has been great. We began shipping in March and many customers have called the product a true game changer. For those of you who are new to our business, new TASER devices take a few quarters to ramp in terms of sales as our customers need to trial and get trained before they can go into full deployment. Next, as you saw in the video, as Axon Accelerate last month, we announced Axon Body 4. 4 years ago on our earnings call, I told you about our vision for the future of body cameras and public safety. And once our cameras can talk over wireless networks, they've become something more like an Alexa on your chest as opposed to just a camera you wear to record, and that would open up a whole host of really interesting services. Well, now for the first time ever, officers and remote support teams can communicate with one another in real time with a two-way device. We think this is going to provide an entirely new level of awareness and situational support, especially when officers are dealing with mental health crises or battling language barriers. Our customers are already thinking of new ways to apply this technology, and we can't wait to see what they'll do with it. Our vision for the future of public safety technology is coming together. When our new TASER and body cameras are paired with Axon respond, the full power of our real-time operational capabilities is unlocked. We can solve so many of the decision-making challenges public safety professionals space today. And I'm fortunate to be leading a company that has attracted the best talent across the globe to achieve what we set out to do. We believe people are inspired to do their best work when they are truly inspired to solve the problems that they care about. So we hire people who are passionate about our mission. And we saw big problems. We create value and everything else falls into place. Finally, I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Axon's inclusion in the S&P 500 as of May 4, a testament to Axon's stable business model, our growth mission and our global impact. Thank you to our customers, partners and employees for making this positive. We founded Axon 30 years ago in the Tucson garage, and it has been a remarkable journey and our best days are yet to come. And so with that, I'd like to turn over to our Chief Operating Officer, Josh Isner. Yes. Great. So all these new services is we look at developing them upfront. We first asked ourselves is this solving a valuable problem that our customers will see great value in. And then we also look at, okay, where will the funding for these come from? So you mentioned VR. So that's a great example. Especially with our international customers, we've been looking at this very closely where the training costs associated with the TASER rollout can actually be several times greater than the cost of all the hardware in terms of logistics of bringing officers in, backfilling when they are off the street, all the time and effort that goes into it. And with VR, we're going to be able to dramatically streamline the training of officers by creating virtual training spaces, where a lot of it could happen without direct even human oversight from an instructor as they are learning the base its skills. We need a lot of repetition in. So for example, right now, agencies may fire somewhere between 6 and a maximum of maybe 18 cartridges per year. We compare that to the thousands of bullets that they hire. But with VR, they can fire unlimited numbers of rounds. So our anticipation is by next year, every office are going through TASER certification training, will fire over 100 cartridges in VR, really building all the muscle memory and the skill and we will be able to do it in a much more time-efficient way, and we can distribute that training. So for example, a lot of this training, including better recurrent training can happen out at the precinct level or the station level rather than having to bring officers into centralized training locations. If I look at some of the things we're doing around, for example, some of our AI services around transcription, for example, many of our customers, for example, in Canada, have to provide transcripts of every piece of evidence that is submitted, particularly in murder cases and I believe in other high-level felony type cases. So our ability to provide a machine transcript that's linked in with the video greatly reduces the amount of time. And we think over time, we will be able to get to a point where there will be no need for human intervention. So everything that we're doing is designed to create value that will find a place somewhere where we're displacing inefficiency in the current budget or in some cases, competing products like what we did with our ALPR service, that historically, agencies might pay $18,000 to $20,000 per vehicle to put a bespoke ALPR dedicated hardware camera system. We've turned that into a virtualized service offering, which just sits as a layer on top of our existing in-car camera. So our in-car camera is cost competitive, all on its own and provides really great value. And now they can choose to turn on ALPR just as a software service layer running on top. So I hope that's helpful. Just in general, as we're looking at all of these we both make sure we're solving problems that are valuable to solve and that there is a path for the budget to either come from increased efficiency, reduce costs or displacing some existing competitors. Thank you very much. Yes. I'll jump in with one of my favorite quotes from science fiction author, William Gibson, who says the future is here, it's just not evenly distributed. Live streaming when we introduced it a few years ago was a totally new concept. And my tech when we first launched body cameras, this is in an industry where new concepts take a little while to really take hold. But there is one agency in Texas called the Texas Medical Center. We had the chief up during my teeno. He is now live streaming every call for service into dispatch, and his results have been just phenomenal. Imagine just for a moment that you're a police dispatcher in today's world you're probably supporting five different calls happening with 10 to 15 different officers. You've got to keep track of what's happening largely through these cryptic radio messages on a shared channel with the officers you're managing as well as what other people are managing. And you have very little idea about what's actually happening at these calls. And then flip to a different world where as you're doing this, you can have a screen where you can see visually what's happening for all those officers. And it turns out that our visual system is highly tuned to notice things that are abnormal or out of the ordinary. For example, you are sitting next to somebody on an airplane, right. None of us want to you to creepy person reading the phone of person next to us. And you don't notice it when there is text is going on, but if they get some photo or something, they will just grab your attention. And even though it's far in your periphery, you immediately who, I don't even mean to invade this person precut your visual system is really good at that. Well, now if you are a dispatcher, what we are hearing from TMC is that these officers or the dispatchers are rapidly able to wait a minute, something doesn't look right with what's happening here, and they will then tune in and focus. They may call for a supervisor to tune in live, they will dispatch additional resources. In some cases, they are helping officers. One of them noticed somebody who would been in a different call, who then gave that officer of fake ID or a false name. So, I have high confidence that in another 5 years to 10 years, the idea of trying to run a police department with only radio voice traffic is going to see just crazy once you can do this with audio and video and more sophisticated integration of sensors. And we believe we are really on the kind of the edge book clubs we made the decision with AB3 to put LTE into every camera and then allow that to start iterating together with our customers to learn about these new use cases. So, the two-way voice, once you can see a video, the next thing frequently you want to do is communicate with that person and not have to do it over a radio that air traffic is very tightly controlled. It's not one-on-one. You can't have a rich conversation. You have to use cryptic codes because you are also transmitting to 15 or 20 other people that aren't involved in that conversation. So, we are still early in AB4 rolling out, but we think the feature set hits both the transformative new capability and then some simple things like some people love to have the head mounted camera, some like to mount it on the shoulder, many officers prefer the body camera. Those have always been two separate SKUs where you couldn't reconfigure them. We now have one SKU where we can reconfigure if you go from SWAT to patrol or wherever you can now have many mounting options, and the ability to recharge while you are in the car with a magnetic disconnect map gives us effectively infinite battery life. So, we think this has been a great combination of both transformative and just continuing to deliver on the basics. One anecdote I will share, forgive my enthusiasm, but we had one customer at TASER 10, a midsize is in several hundred officer agency that was sitting in the keynote and called back to their chief and they actually changed in order that was in process, and they got the order through, I believe the Chief Signature and the purchasing department of the city by the end of that day. We have not seen something like that again, I don't want to get too excited from a projection standpoint, but that reaction to me was just extremely meaningful that they saw this as something that was worth really disrupting the whole process to stop an existing order pivot on a dime and get the new thing approved. And then the other thing I would tell you is where I think TASER 10 make a really huge difference is in the international markets. TASER 10, for the first time, I think we have a weapon that could become the officer's primary defensive tool, probably not in the U.S. because we live in a country watch in guns and officers need to have their legal weapons. But picked your average European country where police are all wearing pistols in nations that really don't have a gun crime problem. And previous versions of the TASER weapon probably didn't have enough capability range, enough shots that you would rely on it as the primary tool to defend yourself. And I think we are now crossing that Rubicon. And I think that can really open up the international markets where we have the opportunity to become the primary defensive tool. Awesome. Obviously, excited to be off to a good start, two major new product launches. I think VR, which you guys asked some questions about here was really going to start getting it strived the back half of this year. We have integrated new sensors so that TASER 10 will be first. We will have a really fine-tuned, very smooth, integrated product experience. TASER 7 will follow, and then we will start rolling out various firearms and other platforms. So, we think we are really setting the right stage with these two new products and this progress towards our moonshot to continue to sell value-added premium services and to really go wide with VR. By next year, we think that will be common for pretty much every officer, and instructor who is getting trained on TASER that we believe VR can become the standard. And that's going to create an opportunity for us to then launch a whole lot more content and services through our VR platform. So, Jeff has just been doing a great job with the team, hiring and bringing in great talent to build all of this and then putting together a strategy for how to layer all the hardware and the software pieces. So, we are just really excited to have you shareholders and analysts who have been of our journey. And we are just getting started. We got an exciting 10-year march ahead of us to cut gun related deaths in half, and I am confident we are going to do it. So, with that, we will see you all next at our shareholder meeting and then at our next quarterly results, I have to wrap up Q2. So, thanks everybody, and have a great night."

[Video Presentation]\nRick Smith: All right, thanks Eric. And I want to thank all of you. Look at I would thank all of our shareholders for joining us here today. So welcome to Axon's third quarter 2024 earnings call. It is truly humbling to come back to you with another fantastic update and to show you these videos that capture what we've been working on and the relationships we strive to build with our customers. These calls are a great opportunity for us to reflect on our recent momentum while thinking about what's next. As I've shared with you in the past, I spend the majority of my time with our customers and with our product teams, ensuring that we are inventing and focused on the right things and aligning our efforts where our customers need us, where they need us to be for their future. I've been able to lean in with hundreds of our customers over the past few months between the AUSA, which is the Big army show, IACP, the Chiefs of Police Conference, and several events at our offices and internationally. Our customers are as excited as we are about what's ahead and it's energizing to see them ready to move forward with us on this journey together. There's no place where this is more clear to me than the area of artificial intelligence. The interest is immense here and we are already building a suite of products for our new AI Era plan, providing access to an expanding set of solutions. Our strategy here is twofold. First, we understand and believe that AI innovation is moving at a breakneck pace. It would be almost impossible for us to continually update our go-to-market offerings at the speed that AI is moving. With this plan, we get to deliver an ever changing and expanding offering that drives increased value for our customers over time. Second, we want to partner with our customers by offering them access to the solutions we have today and those we are building for the future. We can work together on this, adapting to deliver what they need as technology improves and evolves. We know the best way to win is by putting our customers first. This is going to be how we help them harness the power of AI as we launch many exciting products over the coming years. AI is one of the many areas that excite me about our business, but it's not the only one. TASER 10 combined with the power of our expanding virtual reality or VR training portfolio continues to gain traction as a disruptive force to how we deescalate in difficult situations. Real time capabilities enabled with Axon Body 4 and Fusus have advanced response and communication in ways that are finally modernizing public safety communication tools that have been a bit stagnant for decades. And our momentum in newer categories like drones and robotics continues to accelerate with our recently closed acquisition of Dedrone, which helped enable Campbell PD as you saw, to gain the first FAA approval waiver for 24/7 drone operations as first responder. To summarize, I'm very excited about what we are seeing in the market today and the energy our customers have put behind what we are doing. We're on a multi-year journey to modernize the way public safety operates and the opportunity in front of us is to drive real improvement in outcomes that matter to our communities and to our customers who work tirelessly every day to make the world safer. While we report our results to you on a quarterly basis, I believe our success is measured in years and lives saved. We remain focused on our moonshot goal and our mission to protect life and we're thankful to have you on this journey with us. And with that I'll turn it over to Josh Isner.\nJosh Isner: Thanks a lot Rick and good afternoon everybody. This week we are participating in a core element of our culture at Axon, putting our customers first together. It is the week of the customer internally where we invite customers into work to share their stories, recognize our internal support teams and double down on employee in on employee training to ensure that the customer remains at the center of our universe. I'd like to share a quick anecdote to that end. In response to the devastating hurricanes that impacted the southeastern U.S. in September and October, we deployed our Axon Aid emergency Response Team to work alongside first responders around the clock for 16 days. Our team got to witness the magnitude of customer\u2019s efforts firsthand. At Axon we know our customers are heroes and being a small service to them in this mission was an honor and nothing short of inspirational. We work every day to help our customers achieve better outcomes and when we put their needs first, we get to share in their successes. Understanding this is something I have spent a lot of time on and it percolates into how we've built our team. When I look at what our team is working on with our customers and the results we are delivering because of our strong partnership with them, I continue to be excited and impressed. I'll briefly share a few updates that build my confidence. First, our record results. We just delivered our 11th consecutive quarter, growing above 25% in our third quarter this year growing above 30%. That growth puts us at a level where we are accomplishing in quarters what took us years to do only a few years ago. Second, while we've been growing fast, we still have line of sight to a multiyear growth opportunity that continues to build. We closed Q3 with record bookings in excess of $1 billion on both an absolute and normalized five year basis. That's our strongest normalized booking quarter in history outside of Q4 last year. As we move to close out this Q4, which has historically been our strongest bookings quarter, we are already executing against the largest pipeline we've ever had and we fully expect to post an exceptional and record result again. Third, what's really encouraging here is that we are seeing strength across the board. Our state and local business is firing on all cylinders, led by Jessica Duncan and the early interest we are seeing in our AI Era plan signals to me that this new offering could be one of the more meaningful drivers for us in the year to come. Beyond our state and local business, our U.S. Federal bookings came in higher than what we did in a full year just a few years ago, with four of our top 10 domestic deals in the quarter coming from federal customers across several agencies including DHS, IRS and Amtrak. Looking ahead, we have a clear path to surpass the Q3 federal bookings again in Q4 for our strongest year yet. International bookings came in at near record levels, matching Q4 of last year up 40% sequentially from Q2 and our year-to-date international bookings are up 40% from last year. Similar to federal we see a clear path to surpass Q3 bookings again in Q4. Finally, we saw strong bookings from corrections customers from our in our justice segment continued to grow and we have several Fortune 500 companies conducting retail security trials with Axon products in the Enterprise segment. As is the case every Q4, we must do two things well. Number one, close out the year with maximum intensity and flawless execution and number two, ensure that we are well prepared to drive a record 2025. We have a lot of sharp, adaptable and unstoppable teammates that are embracing this challenge. I know I say this a lot, but I truly believe Axon is in the strongest position we've ever been. We have an immense opportunity ahead to grow our business and continue to progress toward our moonshot goal, which we will pursue with vigor. Now I'll pass it over to Brittany to go over everything in more detail. Brittany?\nBrittany Bagley: Thank you, Josh. This quarter marks two years for me at Axon and the business has certainly been incredible. I couldn't be more pleased to share the results of another great Q3. We grew revenue 32% year-over-year and delivered strong adjusted EBITDA with a 26.7% margin. We achieved this margin expansion while driving over 30% top line growth and we continue to successfully prioritize balancing the bottom line with achieving that strong top line growth that we promise. As Rick and Josh both talked about, the focus on product innovation and delivering for our customers remains our north star and is what enables us to keep delivering these types of results. Thank you to everyone on our team who drives that focus. As we get into the details, I am particularly excited that the revenue growth is broad based in terms of products and customer verticals. Josh spoke to the strength we're seeing across different customers. The strength is across our products as well. For example, our acquisition of Fusus has been very positive across a number of our verticals and TASER 10 also continues to exceed our expectations on its adoption. TASER revenue was a standout in the quarter, growing 36% year-over-year, the strongest growth in our TASER segment in more than two years on the back of increased capacity and broad based demand. Cloud and services was up 36% year-over-year with software revenue as the primary driver. ARR of $885 million is up 36% year-over-year and our net revenue retention, an indicator of growth with our existing and new customers, increased to 123%. Sensors and other revenue was up 18% year-over-year with strong demand for Axon Body 4 partially offset by Fleet. Fleet continues to be a very strong product, but given RFP timing and customer deployment schedules, we expected to have inconsistent hardware revenue quarter-to-quarter. Overall, our future contracted revenue sits at approximately $7.7 billion exiting the quarter which is up 33% year-over-year. As a reminder, this is a gap definition of our remaining performance obligations and will not tie exactly to commentary we share about bookings. Bookings are also seasonally strongest for us in Q3 and Q4 and as Josh shared, we're continuing to see that this year with a strong Q4 in front of us. Adjusted gross margin of 63.2% was stable sequentially and up approximately 50 basis points from last year. Overall, as we have ramped automation and efficiency in our TASER 10 manufacturing, we have stabilized our margins and expect to maintain these approximate levels subject to the usual business mix dynamics. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.7% was a three year record driven by operating leverage as we delivered scale on strong revenue. One note on our financials that you will see in our forthcoming 10-Q is that we have made a revision to our historical financials to reflect corrections of certain areas related to the categorization of some of our partner relationships as principal instead of as agent. We concluded that these were not material to any previously issued financial statements. Our current period reported financials and revised historical financials reflect revenue and expense recognition consistent with the corrections we made in the revision. Now turning to our guidance, we are pleased to raise guidance again on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Our Q4 revenue guidance is a range of $560 million to $570 million representing more than 30% growth at the midpoint. This implies approximately $2.07 billion in full year revenue or greater than 32% annual growth, up from our prior guidance of $2 billion to $2.05 billion or 29.5% growth. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the fourth quarter is a range of $130 million to $135 million or approximately 23.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. This implies full year adjusted EBITDA dollars of approximately $510 million or 24.6% margin. Note that Q4 implies lower adjusted EBITDA margins than we were just able to achieve in Q3, which is a result of timing on some of our expenses and also reflects a full quarter of our now closed Dedrone Acquisition and costs to integrate. We continue to have conviction in our margin target of 25% for 2025 which continues to show nice leverage over full year 2024. Overall, we are very pleased with our progress against the 3-year targets we set out for 2025. We are on pace to deliver our initial $2 billion revenue target for 2025 a full year early and remain confident in our extended target of 20% or greater annual growth, all while increasing our adjusted EBITDA margins and achieving the 25% target next year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to take any questions.\nOperator:\nErik Lapinski: Thanks Brittany. We can all get up into Gallery view. We'll take our first question from George Notter at Jefferies. Hey George.\nGeorge Notter: Hi guys. Thanks very much. Congratulations on the strong results. I wanted to ask some questions about Draft One. I'm curious if you can give us an update on your progress in the September quarter there. In terms of pipeline, was there any revenue recognition tied to Draft One, any significant contributions to your ARR?\nRick Smith: So thanks a lot for the question. I really appreciate it. In terms of Draft One, yes, we did receive some orders in Q3, from kind of early customers. So there was some impact on revenue from Draft One. But I would still say we're in like the top of the first inning on what that's going to look like moving forward, especially as we go into next year with Draft Rule One being the anchor product of our AI Era bundle. And so certainly we're very, very bullish on Draft One and all of our AI products contributions to both revenue and profitability over time. But we're still not yet seeing a major impact on the quarter-to-quarter results which is expected due to the SaaS accounting.\nGeorge Notter: Last quarter. I think you guys mentioned $100 million pipeline. I think in six or seven weeks of selling on Draft One, is there an update to that number?\nRick Smith: It continues to grow, especially after IACP. So we're again and we're converting some of that pipeline into the new kind of AI Era bundle that we're coming out with next year as well. And again, Draft One is really the kind of central driver of interest in that bundle along with a number of other AI features where developing right now. So certainly safe to say that the interest is the most we've seen out of any, year one product.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. One last follow up and I'll pass it on. Where are we going to land in terms of pricing on that? I realize it's going to go into the bundle. I know you guys have been selling it Ala carte to some degree to early customers. We had heard price points of $30, $40 amonth. But is that, is that kind of the right zip code in terms of where this is priced or where maybe the incremental bundle would step up to in terms of pricing? Any sense there?\nRick Smith: Sure. So right now Draft One alone is $65 a month and it requires transcription on top of that for another 20. So at 85 a month for just Draft One, we're looking at the AI Era bundle price of 199 and the sum of the parts of that bundle is expected to be somewhere around $250 or $350 in terms of everything included in it. So good economics for buying, as a group of features instead of individual standalone features. But that'll be the price going into next year.\nGeorge Notter: Thank you.\nRick Smith: And those are just the launch features. Of course, the features in the AI Era plan are going to grow, rapidly.\nGeorge Notter: Makes sense. Thanks.\nBrittany Bagley: And I would probably just note that we'll, we'll probably. You'll hear us talking more and more about the AI bundle plan and less and less and about Draft One as sort of an individual product or an individual data point. It's really going to, as Josh said, be the anchor product in the new AI bundle. We'll continue to add features there, but that's what you'll hear us talking about quarter-to-quarter.\nRick Smith: That's right. And of course, pretty much everything in that plan are pure SaaS software additions on top of our overall software. ARR. Of course, they build upon people who have our hardware like cameras and TASERS and the like. But the Era plan itself is all good old SaaS.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, George. Up next, we've got Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Hey, good afternoon. Just wanted to get a sense from you. As you start to think about sort of the broader opportunity around drones. As a first responder, how should we think about, maybe the ability to monetize this, the ability to see broader adoption and, what sort of has to happen for that to take place. Thank you.\nJosh Isner: Rick, do you want to start and I'll pile on.\nRick Smith: Sorry, I have myself on mute. First, Jonathan, are you cheating on us with the headphone listening to another earnings call at the same time?\nJonathan Ho: Potentially.\nRick Smith: Awesome. Hey, so, yes, we see drones as a huge opportunity. The Dedrone acquisition, we think, is a real key part of that. Because before you can start flying drones without extra humans standing around watching them, you've got to be able to see your airspace. And an array of sensors can see the airspace far better than a human on a rooftop. And so part of our assessment in making the Dedrone acquisition was a dual bet, number one, that it would be a key enabler for DFR. To be able to fly your own drones, you got to be able to see the airspace well. And then the second is that we're going to see increased interest in counter drone capabilities. I just learned this past week that apparently somebody in Pennsylvania put a pipe bomb on a drone and is going to fly it into critical infrastructure or something. We'd be glad to see, there has not been that much of that kind of activity here in the U.S. but it's certainly growing all over the world and we certainly hope it doesn't come here. I think it is something that's likely to get more nefarious use. And right now, counter drone is really limited to federal agencies, meaning, state and local cannot interdict the drones themselves. So Dedrone is helpful in that case because it will tell you where the pilot is and you can go deal with the pilot directly. However, there was a bill in Congress, I believe, this year. I don't think it's going to make it through, but there have been some efforts to give state and local law enforcement the ability to interdict drones. Not to get into politics, but my assessment of the shift of the election we're coming out of is that that is likely to speed up law enforcement enabling legislation, potentially including the local ability for law enforcement to interdict drones. So Dedrone is a tech enabler. I think Skydio is a partner. We sort of made a shift with the shifting relationship. DJI, you know, is a Chinese drone manufacturer. We think there's legislation afoot that passed the House of Representatives unanimously that's going to be blocking DJI long term and frankly all Chinese drones. And so we shifted our focus really with Skydio, who turns out is the world leader in autonomy already for drones that can fly themselves effectively. So we think between the partnership, the acquisition of Dedrone and then some pending legislative changes, I would expect within 24 months we'll see a shifting landscape to where our state and local folks can begin using more aggressive counter drone capabilities. And by the way, last thing I'll say is we did a full scan of the, of the world's sort of counter drone providers a few years ago before we selected Dedrone. And we liked Dedrone strategy. They were very focused on detection and not getting too aggressive on mitigation. Knowing that, basically owning the detection space and being at a lower cost point than some of the competitors that have been out there focused on more military style interdiction efforts has given them a good footprint to scale from. And then the strategy has been able to plug in other hardware over time as the legal landscape changes.\nJosh Isner: And then Jon, I just add two things on Rick's great summary. One thing that we're super pumped about is how the market's evolving to think about the real time crime center space and the DFR space together, which we think is both right and good for agencies and communities. And plays right into our strengths and our differentiation as a solution. So the combination of fusus in the real time crime center deeply connected with all of our other devices, and then into the DFR partnership stuff that Rick was just talking about, agencies are thinking about buying those together and that's both great for them as they think about how they use this technology to keep community safe. And it plays right into all of Axon strengths. And the second, which is another example of that same thing, we just had a major agency who is in the middle of rolling out their DFR stuff the other day, talk unprompted about the notion of they would love to have an officer be able to press that watch me button that we have on our AB4 cameras and have that under the right conditions, automatically trigger the dispatch of a DFR drone to bring help and extra overwatch to that situation even faster than what any other human in the loop could be. And that's exactly the kind of solution that's powered by the combination of all the things we bring to bear for agencies.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent. And then just as a follow up, I mean, TASER again had very strong quarter. We regularly receive the question whether, the TASER business can sustain this level of growth. And you just want to get a sense from, what gives you the confidence that we can continue to see TASER be one of the major drivers, drivers of the business. Or, or maybe do you see, a shift in leadership where, things like Draft One will start to take over that growth over time. Thank you.\nRick Smith: But they, they do compete for the top slot. And it does make me proud that the old warhorse that's TASER can still, can still run. So we -- I think we've got so many things that have the opportunity to continue -- to be disruptive and to grow. The big one for TASER, just to come back on that to me is really international. I think we are on the cusp and actually I'm getting text updates from my engineers that are in the lab today actually working on some pretty cool stuff related to TASER that we think we have the opportunity in the next couple of years to become the primary weapon internationally. Now in the U.S. the gun is going to remain primary for quite a while culturally because police are dealing with so many guns out in the public. But in much of the world, a gun is just if you had a viable, high reliability alternative and for within that 45 foot range, and I'll just tell you the last thing we're working on is clothing penetration. Once we get that dialed in, we've got a shot at becoming the primary self-defense weapon in international markets where there's not a high propensity of handguns out in the public. And I think that could be a real game changer for TASER.\nJosh Isner: And I might just add one or two more thoughts there about the question of is this sustainable for the TASER business to keep growing? In my opinion, the answer is absolutely yes. Like we're year two of five in an upgrade cycle right now. We continue to see exceptionally strong demand, literally double what it was, as we've said on previous calls, you know, with T7. And so certainly a lot of runway ahead to continue to grow the TASER business. And look like, as Rick said, the TASER business is going to solve one of the most critical issues in policing over the long-term, which is that these encounters can end in death either from a civilian or, a police officer. And if we can solve that problem, I still think we're scratching the surface of what the TASER business is capable of.\nBrittany Bagley: Just from a detailed sort of modeling perspective. I don't know that I would expect every quarter to be as strong as this quarter was. This was a particularly strong quarter for TASER and that is partly because we got more capacity online for the TASER business, which helps us go fulfill all of that demand. So just from a growth standpoint, I would say this quarter really stood out and it continues to be across both T10 and our T7 and legacy handles. So that was a little bit unique. But everything Rick and Josh said about the long term trajectory the power of T10, the ability to sell it into different markets, holds over, over the long-term.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent. Thank you again and congrats on the strong quarter.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Jonathan. Up next, we have Mike Ng at Goldman Sachs.\nMike Ng: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I wanted to follow up on a comment made about 4Q24. I think you said it would be likely a record bookings quarter, is that right? And was the year ago 4Q bookings in that like $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion range just to make sure we're thinking about that the right way. And if you could talk about some of the visibility and the confidence that you have in those things that you mentioned, federal bookings increasing sequentially, international bookings, is it AI Era, is it, the pipeline growth that you've seen coming out of IACP would just love some color around the bookings outlook that you gave for 4Q. Thank you.\nRick Smith: Sure. Yes. Certainly reiterating that I'm very confident and encouraged here in terms of what we're going to do in Q4 bookings. Probably won't give you a specific number other than we expected to exceed last quarter. And I think on the last call I said the sum of Q3 and Q4 this year will be comparable to what we did in the full year last year in terms of bookings. So we're very bullish on bookings. Part of what's informing that confidence is just tremendous execution across all four segments of the business, state and local, enterprise, federal and international. We have meaningfully meaningful deals in all four of those segments in Q4 and in a lot of them such that there's no, there's not, it's not like a huge percentage of the bookings would be concentrated on one deal. We feel really, really good about the foundation and we're excited to talk in more detail about our Q4 bookings in February.\nBrittany Bagley: There's been a couple of questions now about like, what's, what's going to do better or what's going to drive the growth going forward. I think one of the things that I like so much that this quarter demonstrates is the growth is across the board. So you, you might get a little more from one segment one quarter and a little more from another segment, another quarter, but really across the business. The devices on the strength of AB4, TASER on the strength of TASER 10, and then our software, on the strength of both our existing software businesses continuing to perform well, and then the very bright future that we think the AI plan has will continue to drive software. And so, you'll see a slightly different mix every quarter. But as you look long-term, you really should expect all three of those pieces to continue driving our growth.\nMike Ng: Excellent. Thanks. And if I could follow up on the earlier TASER question. The revenue, I counted this was the sixth consecutive quarter where TASER has hit a revenue record. You talked a little bit about faster than expected adoption. I think if we look back to TASER 7, it probably took you, I think, five years to get to 80% to 85% adoption. How much shorter can that be? And could you just remind us, like, what's the typical price mix or ASP uplift versus TASER 7? Thank you.\nJosh Isner: So, Mike, the question was how fast can we get to 85 adoption on T10 versus T7.\nMike Ng: Yes, that's right.\nJosh Isner: Okay, look, I think that would be setting our sights short, I would say. Our goal is to transition every T7 and legacy model TASER into a T10. And we, we think we have an opportunity to do that. I think this, this TASER 10, while, while each TASER is an incremental improvement over the last one, TASER 10 is just a fundamental, massive leap forward in the technology, in the de-escalation capabilities, in the officer safety features. We really believe that, every cop will be best served with a TASER set with a TASER 10. I'm sorry. And certainly as we go into the next few years here of the, of the TASER 10 life cycle, the primary goal is upgrade and replacement of the current fleet. And again, we're very confident in our ability to do that.\nMike Ng: Great. Excellent. Thank you, Josh.\nJosh Isner: Thank you.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Mike. Up next, we have Joe Cardoso at JPMorgan.\nJoe Cardoso: Hi, thanks for the question, guys. I guess maybe just a quick clarification on the bookings. And Josh, can you just like quickly clarify if your comments today, are you guys on track to meet the bogey that you laid out last quarter and achieving bookings in line with full year 2023 in the back half of this year, or is it more like unknown? I'm just curious if you could just flush that out a little bit more because it does seem like perhaps you're a little bit off pace. And I just want to make sure that I'm not thinking about that incorrectly.\nJosh Isner: I'd say you're thinking about that incorrectly.\nJoe Cardoso: Okay. And then so when you, when you're going into the back half of this year, like, where are you actually seeing the growth and driving these bookings across the portfolio? Is it really all broad base in terms of the, the entire portfolio? Are you guys embedding any of the new AI suite in that, in terms of the releases there? Just curious in terms of like how you're thinking about the drivers and the rank ordering that. And then I have a quick follow up.\nJosh Isner: Yes, sure. Look, I certainly appreciate the question, Joe. And these deals that are going to be closed in Q4 are deals that, generally a 6 to 12 month sales cycle at a minimum. Right. These things take the full year to come together. We talk in Q1 when bookings are seasonally light. Traditionally that part of that is the team is getting their arms around the new products and the new pricing, getting their arms around their new book of business as the territories can change and so forth. And so that's really where the groundwork goes into, like building the pipeline for the rest of the year. And naturally most of that closes in Q3 and Q4, especially when you see some of the biggest budgets in the country, the federal government, Florida, Texas, all ending on September 30th you get a lot of September action and then you get a lot of new budget dollars being spent in Q4. And so I don't know that the AI bundle is going to have a major impact on Q4 since we launched it in the same quarter. And we're still building the pipe for the long-term for some of our newer features and products. So the big driver of a lot of these deals is officer safety plan execution in the state and local market and some large deals and international, federal and enterprise that have been coming together over the course of several quarters. So certainly expect, Q4 to really trump Q3 in terms of just the absolute dollars and the normalized bookings. But it's also the result of a lot of pipeline building that happened throughout the year.\nJoe Cardoso: No, got it. Very clear. Josh, thanks. Appreciate the explanation there. And then maybe a question for Brittany. Just margins have tracked nicely through the year and expanded each quarter and even outperforming kind of your expectations, if I'm remembering the guides correctly. So as we look here into the fourth quarter, the guide here for a sequential decline, can you maybe just walk us through what has been the driver of outperformance in margins over the past couple of quarters and then relative to your expectations going into this quarter, like what's different that's driving your expectation for the sequential decline to occur in the fourth quarter itself. Thanks for the questions.\nBrittany Bagley: Yes, so we've actually done a pretty good job hitting our expense targets and our OpEx targets. And then our revenue has outperformed. And so what you're really seeing is, some nice flow through on that higher top line revenue coming through to the bottom line. And it's been really nice to see how the team has been able to scale and get some leverage out of the, out of the OpEx and especially on the SG&A side. When we look at Q4 though, we also expect that some of the benefit has been timing right. Like we've been talking about timing. Not everything hits exactly the quarter. So we've been a little bit behind on some of our expense spend as we've gone through the first three quarters. We expect to catch up on some of that in Q4. And then the other thing is we expect to have a full quarter of Dedrone and some of the integration costs associated with Dedrone in Q4 now that we have closed that deal.\nJosh Isner: And I might just add one more thought on adjusted EBITDA, just high level, which is the thing I'm most excited about, is the fact that we are not sacrificing R&D to achieve these results. Right. Like that's that, it would be very easy to drive up adjusted EBITDA by mortgaging the future. And I don't think anyone feels that way right now. We're still in the place of just loading up on new opportunities and investing relentlessly in them. We're just seeing, like Brittany said, over delivery and a lot more discipline in SG&A as well.\nJoe Cardoso: Thanks, Brittany. Thanks, Josh. Appreciate the color.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Joe. Up next, we have Jamie Reynolds at Morgan Stanley.\nJamie Reynolds: Hey, good afternoon, everyone and congrats again on the quarter. Rick, I know you just mentioned there's probably some stuff to keep an eye on for the international market going forward, but just given the strength and bookings that you've kind of seen through the year, I guess could you give us a sense as to what's driving maybe the improved traction kind of near term and kind of as we go into next year?\nRick Smith: It really is broad based. I think the about Jeff was at six, seven months ago, I just come back from a tech conference and told Jeff we need to pull the emergency brake and take a look at all of our product development plans and look at where AI would enable new features that weren't even on our, you know, on our visibility list a year ago. Not the emergency brake.\nJamie Reynolds: Turn the wheel.\nRick Smith: Well, no, this is the one where you're in reverse and you pull the brake. It's like the Duke's a hazard. Anyway, it was, it was a pretty big shift and for example, one that came out of that. We also, I do these AI roundtables. Well, they're customer roundtables, but we did one really focused on AI and one thing that became very clear was being able to do real time translation on a body camera would be just insanely valuable. It rated at the top of the charts and so we pivoted. Jeff, basically, you can imagine like how disruptive this is to his days managing like a thousand 1500 engineers. And it's like, hey, hold on, I know we've got everything planned and everybody's working but let's like disrupt everything. And I think that enabled us to talk about six or seven major eight new AI features by IACP already. And I'm really proud, companies at our scale, it's hard to move like that. But I think that, so our customers are seeing again things that just feel almost magical, that are possible with AI and our investment in things like our EAC, our ethics Advisory Council to help us do safety testing on things like Draft One. Just simply running tests to see if you change the race of the subject. Does that pick up any historical bias from the global data set that these models are trained on? And, and we did pick up some things like word choice, if it says the man fled the scene versus the man left the scene, can really change the emotional perception of that statement. And so we did things like tuning down the word choice severity so that our AI writes the most boring police report it can write because it's a human's job to add emotion and tone to it. Anyway, I think that that focus has really rejuvenated interest in the real time connectivity of body cameras. You all may remember a few years ago we had this whole debate about when we were developing AB3, should we put a wireless chip, a cellular LTE chip in the camera? Our customers were telling us they actually, not only were they not interested in it, they were skeptical of it. We were hearing things like, oh, I don't want my boss watching me real time and micromanaging me from the field. And we still said, just, it may not be, maybe they don't want to real stream real time video, but there's going to be something they're going to want to do. And so not only did we decide to put the, the LTE chip in the camera, we decided to put it in every camera. We made a decision not to sell a camera without it because we knew our customers, if we had a cheaper camera without the thing they didn't know they needed yet, that's the one they would buy. And there was some short term pain because our cost of goods crept up. And as maybe, our customers are on these upgrade plans where they get the next camera and we don't get to charge them anymore for it. So eating, an $80 bomb increase on the hopes and dreams that we would find, a value for that was a bit of a risky bet. Well, now that's really coming home to roost because things like Draft One are only possible because of that real time connectivity, real time translation, only possible because of that real time connectivity. So I think we're now reaping the gains of, of some of those bets we made historically. And it's across the portfolio. I don't think there's any one thing that's what makes this just so exciting. I mean, it makes Jeff's job so difficult and Brittany's, because I'm throwing a thousand features at Jeff and he's like, hold on, slow it down. We got to like rationalize the sequencing and when we're going to build things and what are the things that are going to be delightful to use out of the gate now that aren't going to overset customer expectations. And of course, Brittany is, well, making sure that we're holding the line on how much we're spending on all this stuff.\nJosh Isner: So it was one just thought, I think again, it's what so many of the things that are a Goldilocks [ph] and magical, I think about Axon's flywheel, for lack of a better phrase, connecting like the questions about what's happening with bookings or demand, like right now. And then everything Rick's talking about the future is. It's all of our new innovations are really leading indicators of this time, next year's growth. Not about this quarter's growth because of the sales cycle stuff, because of building stuff, but they feed into customers excitement about their bet on Axon for the long-term. But the bookings that are, this quarter, next quarter are about the pipe, as Josh talked about that got that got laid nine months ago. And it all connects in that ongoing sequence, feeding upon itself in a really virtuous, virtuistic way that we're super excited about.\nRick Smith: Hey, Jamie, was your question specific to international at all or was that.\nJamie Reynolds: Yes, yes, it was just kind of what's driving that improved uptake internationally?\nRick Smith: Yes, for sure.\nJosh Isner: You're going to actually answer the question he asked.\nRick Smith: Everything's optional, but we might as well answer that one as well. So on International, look, as you know, in searching for a new CRO, our big priority was upping our game internationally. And Cameron Brooks has come in really early on this year, hit the ground running and has really just helped up our game in terms of the quality of the team, the quality of the execution, how we're executing now, but also building for the future. And I think just across the board, we've got some new players on the team that, that are really good kind of free agent signings. We've got a lot of customer momentum from the work that's been done in the last couple of years. And we're starting to, frankly, just see things come together at a, at a more polished level. There's still a long way to go. There's still a huge tam out there. Everything's going to take time internationally, just due to the fact you're dealing with federal governments in all of these countries, not, state and local police forces that, that are able to operate semi autonomously. So it's still going to be a grind, but we really, really believe we're on the right track. And it's a tribute to kind of the team we're building here, led by Cameron.\nJamie Reynolds: Great. Thank you so much. Congrats again.\nRick Smith: You got it, Jamie. Thanks.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Jamie. Up next, we have Jordan at Bank of America.\nJordan Lyonnais: Hey, thank you guys for taking the question. On the administration change, how are you guys looking at the opportunities versus the risks involved, just with what plans have been said, if they come true or not, the increased emphasis on border security versus tariffs.\nRick Smith: Yes, I appreciate the question, Jordan. I'd say the first thing that I want to make really clear is like, we have a very apolitical culture at Axon. We know we've got to be successful in a Democratic administration as well as a Republican administration. And, we've seen that over the last 10 years with both parties being in power and the business continuing to grow. Of course there are going to be some interesting opportunities for us in the new administration that's focused, primarily on border security. We're excited about how we can help there and new capabilities that we can bring to the table to offer support on that. But at the high level, certainly we believe look like saving lives, driving transparency in delivering disruptive technologies to governments and public safety agencies around the world. Those are things that are really not specific to which party is in power. And we're really focused on just delivering the best products we can.\nJordan Lyonnais: Thanks. And then on just if tariffs are imposed, how are you looking at what levers you can pull to offset any supply chain component changes?\nBrittany Bagley: Yes, so we've certainly lived in an environment of tariffs before. And so I think our philosophy is generally to be pretty flexible. We've got multiple sources. From a supplier standpoint, we do, we manufacture our TASERS like in the U.S. so then it'll really be on component parts as those come in. So look, we'll just work through it and we'll be flexible and be nimble as those come through and as we see what they are.\nJordan Lyonnais: Thank you, guys.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Jordan. Up next, we have Josh Riley at Needham.\nJosh Reilly: All right, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting off, can you discuss how the FedRAMP status and your position as the, I believe the only cloud body cam vendor with the highest level FedRAMP status has been helping you win some of these U.S. Federal opportunities And how, just along with that, how, how is the growth in U.S. Federal been, I guess, relative to the broader business this year? Is it significantly above the consolidated growth rate? I know you don't break it out, but any color there would be helpful.\nRick Smith: Yes, thanks a lot, Josh. On the first question regarding FedRAMP, look like we've invested a lot and we've put a lot of effort into being a FedRAMP high product in the federal government. No question about that. And that's certainly a differentiator for us. But I would be so bold as to say even if everybody was on FedRAMP, we're still winning the majority of deals in state and local where we're competing against the same companies without FedRAMP. And so I think it's more of a tribute to the team's quality product delivery and the federal team's phenomenal execution on the sales and more importantly, the support front for our, for our federal law enforcement customers. And so the team's done a nice job this year. There's, as I said, my -- in my remarks, there's a lot to still close in Q4. We could have a better Q4 than Q3, in the federal space, which is generally uncommon because of the end of the budget year at the end of Q3. And so we'll have to see where the dust settles. But certainly exciting double digit growth from federal and a lot of conviction that we're on the right path there.\nJosh Reilly: Got it. That's helpful. And then just going back to the TASER revenues, I think we all generally know that the capacity has been increasing sequentially, but maybe just over the next three or four quarters, should we assume that, I know you said that maybe the sequential increases in revenue may not be the same, but is it safe to assume there's still more capacity increases that will be coming in the next kind of 3 to 5 quarters as well? Thank you.\nBrittany Bagley: Yes, for sure. I mean, we, as we talk about capacity, we have both cart capacity and handle capacity. And as you can imagine we're working to bring both of those up to meet the demand. We see there are lead times. We do have automation equipment. So it's not, we can't always turn on as much supply immediately as we would like to. So you can see the results of us getting more supply on this quarter. And then again, the growth was particularly impressive this quarter. I want to temper everyone's expectations on that looking the same every quarter. But yes, we'll keep bringing capacity on as we continue to see demand increase.\nJosh Reilly: Awesome. Thanks guys.\nBrittany Bagley: Thank you.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Josh. Up next, we'll go to Trevor Walsh at JMP.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks team for taking the questions. Maybe Rick or Josh, kind of high level one for you. Circling back to the Dedrone or, or just general DFR opportunity. Can you does that seem to be in your minds kind of a state and local, U.S. domestic kind of initial push or is there international opportunities along the lines there? And I guess I ask from the standpoint of seems like the landing with TASER of any kind, whether it's TASER 10 or previous models is sort of the kind of the tip of the spear for the U.S. business and it seems to be following a similar type of path in kind of these international front. But just curious if there's, ways for DFR type of use cases to be more again that tip of the spear kind of on the international front with respect to Dedrone and the other things you guys are doing.\nRick Smith: Sure, if I could start first just Dedrone by itself without DFR ton of interest internationally. I mean every country in the world is now thinking about how they're going to deal with drone threats in the past 24 months. And in many cases AD brought just a great capability. He's the CEO at Dedrone and he's brought us new customers too. Whether it was the World cup in Qatar, the NFL stadiums, critical infrastructure. And then we've seen the same thing with Fusus. I mean both of these acquisitions, these were two big bites for us to take, this closely together. And it's, it's been really just impressive how much customer interest there has been in those with Fusus that's really supercharged our enterprise customers. Enterprises want to be able to work collaboratively with public safety and Fusus becomes the backbone of doing that in real time. Dedrone, we think there's, there's more -- it's a new angle into military customers for us. Militaries around the world are very interested in how you deal with these small first person or Mavic style drones, critical infrastructure and then enterprise there as well. So I'd say Dedrone, even on its own is I think not only interesting to our existing customers, but frankly probably even more interesting to the new customer sets they're bringing to us. The DFR is what's making counter drone especially relevant. When I survey our customers in state and local, the responses are, yes, we're kind of interested in counter drone, but that's not really our mission set today to be dealing with hostile drones coming in. Now that for us is more of a future bet that that's going to come on your plate as those threats grow. But the DFR thing is here and now. That's where our customers really light up. Oh, if I can use Dedrone to enable DFR, I want to be able to fly my own drones. Not something I can do today, but I've got to do it in this awkward way where I've got to have people standing on rooftops and it's kind of this manual kludgy thing and we make it much safer and less kludgy by putting a Dedrone sensor up there. So I also am getting interest, where was it we had another DFR use case in one of our other markets. That's not drone as a first responder, but for competitive reasons. I don't want to name which sector it is, but this is a non-law enforcement sector and they don't need to be flying drones as first responder. But boy, they sure would like to be able to fly drones on an automated patrol around their facilities. And so our partnership with Skydio and the acquisition Dedrone and all that really come together naturally for us to be able to service a lot more than just drone as a first responder for police. If you want to fly a drone without having to have manual human overseers on site, like, we can take that. And by the way, Skydio is a partner as well. Brings us into potentially new customers in critical infrastructure and elsewhere where we haven't been historically.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Rick. Thanks, Trevor. Up next we have Keith Housum at Northcoast.\nKeith Housum: Good morning guys. I know we're going to run long here, so I'll try to make my questions quick. Just real quick, Brittany, you talk about the product pull forward or again, I can pull forward, but catching up with a T10 with your capacity, how much of growth in the quarter would you say was more of a -- catching up with capacity as opposed to normalized demand?\nBrittany Bagley: I would break it out. Necessarily, Keith what I would say is we've had incredible demand. Like, our demand has been outpacing our capacity. And so as that demand grows, every quarter, we need to bring more capacity on. And so what you saw this quarter was the combination of the two. But I wouldn't say, it's not like we chewed through backlog or something like that to deliver. You're just seeing the ability for us to ship more into that demand.\nKeith Housum: Got you. Appreciate it. And then services, I know services can be lumpy, but if we look at sequential growth in services of about $6 million, probably the lowest, has grown sequentially for several years, if I look at it correctly. Anything happened in the quarter, or how should we think about services going forward?\nBrittany Bagley: Yes, great, Great question. I think there's two pieces in that one. There's a little bit of a lag in that step as you go through each quarter. So what we really booked in Q3 will show up in Q4. So a little bit of what you're seeing in the step in the quarter is sort of what was going on in Q2 from a booking standpoint. And that's because many of the bookings come in pretty late in the quarter. So the revenue from that doesn't necessarily get captured in our actual number. Then the other piece that's going on in there is that's both our software step and our services business. And so with some of the deployments of our fleet hardware being down in the quarter, which you can see in the fleet number, we actually had less professional services associated with fleet, and so that's actually offsetting some of the software piece. So if you were just looking at software, you would see a larger step than what's coming through and in the number you're actually seeing, because we actually had a step down in PSO, which is atypical. Normally, PSO is growing and software is growing, but because fleet came down this quarter, you're seeing that dynamic.\nKeith Housum: Got you. Okay, I'll appreciate. I'll turn back over. Thank you.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Keith. We'll try to get everyone in here. We have Will Power at Baird.\nWill Power: Awesome. Thank you all. Congratulations on a. Another strong quarter of execution. Question, probably for Brittany. The software and ARR growth continues to be very good. There was some deceleration from the trendline, you've been on there. So I guess I wondered if there's any other, color or impacts to kind of be aware of there and how to think about modeling that going forward is mid-30s kind of the right growth rate and what are the puts and takes there?\nBrittany Bagley: Yes, I mean, we really look at that sort of on an average basis. Like, I think because of the dynamics I just talked about of timing of when bookings come in a quarter, looking at any one quarter is not as good as sort of averaging out over the year. And you do have things like seasonality playing into that. So I would say nothing underlying it that would change our, sort of four to six quarter average on anything. The step on ARR growth on any of that. You're just seeing a little bit of timing and a quarterly lag is what's showing up in Q3 is really Q2. What will show up in Q4 is really what we're talking about with strength in Q3. And then what will show up in Q1 will be whatever we deliver in Q4.\nKeith Housum: Yes. Just for time. I'll leave it there.\nErik Lapinski: Thank you all. We have one left with Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks and congrats on another fantastic quarter. I want to come back to TASER just for a second. Right. So I think 50% year-over-year growth, really impressive. And it sounds like getting great traction on the international front. I wanted to see if we could unpack the driver there. And it sounds like it's really picking up on the international piece of the business. We know that there's a lot of opportunity domestically still, but internationally, is this more about the capability? And I think just seeing what the device does versus, the prior version, it is a huge step forward from a technology perspective. But does this make you think that the longer term, potential is quite a bit bigger internationally than maybe what you'd seen before? That's part one of my question. The second part actually has to do with cartridge. Cartridge revenue relative to the growth in TASER was really not -- that that was. It was up, I think maybe about 10% year-over-year. And I was just curious if there was something in particular there of why that didn't grow a little bit stronger.\nBrittany Bagley: Yes, I can maybe start with cartridge because that's easy. And then if Josh wants to talk more about TASER, he can. So most of our TASER customers are on sort of a cartridge deployment plan, which smooths out, how you see cartridge revenue come in. But we do have international customers who are not on a plan. And so what you'll see is every now and then our cartridge revenue is particularly lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And so last quarter we had some big international customers come in and place cartridge orders, and then those didn't repeat this quarter. So again, I'd look at a longer trend line of cartridge growth versus last quarter to this quarter. And then I think the only other thing I would add maybe to give a little more color on TASER before I let it go over to Josh, is, last quarter, in his script, Josh talked a bit about how much demand we're seeing for TASER 10 relative to TASER 7. I think he said demand is sort of 2x the pace. But we are still seeing really good performance from TASER 7. And so part of what you're seeing in this quarter is not only are you getting all of those benefits from TASER 10 that we've been talking about, but we do still have customers ordering TASER 7 and some of our other legacy TASER handles and products. And so, that that's sort of combining to give a particularly nice result.\nJosh Isner: Yes. And I just add, you know, Jeremy, I'd say it's in part due to international. Certainly it's a big TAM. We're getting better there. We're building relationships kind of with the right customers. We're doing a better job explaining and demonstrating the value that TASERS bring to police, both in terms of lives saved, but also in terms of officer safety increasing and workers comp decreasing and just some of the issues that come along with absence of TASER deployments. But I think the bigger thing is just very simple. We have phenomenal product market fit with this product. And that's really a credit to Rick. Like our customers are for the first time really seeing that, man, this thing is on track to outperforming a firearm in the field. And we had been talking about it for a long time, but for 30 years with only up to two shots that was still kind of a pipe dream. And now we're seeing it with 10 shots. And customers are saying, man, the increased distance of 45feet combined with the number of shots, combined with the better penetration, those are all things that I think are inspiring more confidence in the device from our customers, whether they be in state and local or federal or international. And so I think that's really it. It's like good sales execution with a product that has, you know, phenomenal product market fit.\nJeremy Hamblin: Great. Thanks for all the color Best wishes.\nRick Smith: Thanks, Jeremy. It was nice to see many of you at IACP. Thanks for making the trip out there and always great to see you at the booth.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Jeremy, and thanks, everyone. That's it for us. We'll give it to Rick to close this out.\nRick Smith: All right, so I have two things I want to conclude on. One, I want to be careful. In my previous statement when I talked about the election results, I'm not talking about which party won where. I'm talking about the overall political environment. For example, in California, voters approved Proposition 36 that basically raised the penalties for shoplifting in certain drug crimes. We're seeing a general shift that manifested in this election, swinging the pendulum, more supportive of public safety in general. And I would say at our company we are violently non-partisan. We have passionate gun control advocates and passionate second amendment gun owners who come to meetings together and are productive. And you could say that across all the divisive issue in politics, and I think Josh in particular has done a great job from setting the tone from leadership perspective that we want to be an intellectually diverse place that where everyone is welcome and we keep the divisive stuff out of the office because we've got a job to do and we do best when the best, brightest, smartest, most passionate people, no matter their political views, feel like this is a place where they can come and do their best work. And then the other thing I wanted to say was, you know, Brittany, two years. It's flown by the. What you're seeing right now. I mean, we see a lot of Britney's fingerprints on the P&L. She really does a great job of just driving both operating and financial rigor. I come back from customers with all sorts of ideas. Some people might say they're crazy and some of them are. And between Brittany and Jeff, they've got to figure out, okay, how do we. How do we sort through what we're actually going to execute on what's actually going to go into a product? You see Jeff give me a thumbs up. He said it's a great Rick, this is really fuzzy idea. And that his idea is to take it from fuzzy to concrete and for Brittany to work with the team, make sure we can make this stuff and execute and make money at it. And then, you know, Josh, the other key member of the team here, he's our Jimmy Johnson. And as a lifelong Cowboys fan, as I'm sure he'll appreciate that reference, he is our head coach and really focuses on just building the team and the people, and that is the magic that we're seeing now is we've got these awesome, productive, dynamic tensions between our team as we each have different strengths and weaknesses and that, through the whole organization you're just seeing a phenomenal execution. And I would also say, hey, you're the ownership is part of this team as well. So we appreciate our shareholders and the analysts who take the time to get to know us over the years and are supportive of us using our shareholders capital to go solve these problems that we're excited and interested to go do that fundamentally we believe make the world a better place when we're done. And that motivates everybody to come to work excited.\nJosh Isner: So Rick, I would have appreciated a Belichick comparison over Jimmy Johnson, but we'll let that one slide.\nRick Smith: Well, I should have made a bet whether I could get that by without comment. All right, so thanks everybody. Thanks to our team, those people listening on the phone, what a phenomenal quarter. And we're really excited to talk to you after the first year. Everybody have a fantastic holiday season. Hug your kids and your family. Hopefully the world's going to get a little less crazy over the next couple years. And it's been over the last few with what's been happening in the Middle East and Ukraine and it's been just so much violence in the world. I self admittedly was maybe too optimistic in my 2017 or 18 book the End of Killing that thought we were at the end of war. Been proven, sort of. The thesis was wrong in terms of timing, but I do think humanity can do better and we can find ways to deal with threats while minimizing the loss of life. And we're going to stay true to that mission. So thanks everybody, enjoy the holidays, we'll see you next year.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "All right, thanks Eric. And I want to thank all of you. Look at I would thank all of our shareholders for joining us here today. So welcome to Axon's third quarter 2024 earnings call. It is truly humbling to come back to you with another fantastic update and to show you these videos that capture what we've been working on and the relationships we strive to build with our customers. These calls are a great opportunity for us to reflect on our recent momentum while thinking about what's next. As I've shared with you in the past, I spend the majority of my time with our customers and with our product teams, ensuring that we are inventing and focused on the right things and aligning our efforts where our customers need us, where they need us to be for their future. I've been able to lean in with hundreds of our customers over the past few months between the AUSA, which is the Big army show, IACP, the Chiefs of Police Conference, and several events at our offices and internationally. Our customers are as excited as we are about what's ahead and it's energizing to see them ready to move forward with us on this journey together. There's no place where this is more clear to me than the area of artificial intelligence. The interest is immense here and we are already building a suite of products for our new AI Era plan, providing access to an expanding set of solutions. Our strategy here is twofold. First, we understand and believe that AI innovation is moving at a breakneck pace. It would be almost impossible for us to continually update our go-to-market offerings at the speed that AI is moving. With this plan, we get to deliver an ever changing and expanding offering that drives increased value for our customers over time. Second, we want to partner with our customers by offering them access to the solutions we have today and those we are building for the future. We can work together on this, adapting to deliver what they need as technology improves and evolves. We know the best way to win is by putting our customers first. This is going to be how we help them harness the power of AI as we launch many exciting products over the coming years. AI is one of the many areas that excite me about our business, but it's not the only one. TASER 10 combined with the power of our expanding virtual reality or VR training portfolio continues to gain traction as a disruptive force to how we deescalate in difficult situations. Real time capabilities enabled with Axon Body 4 and Fusus have advanced response and communication in ways that are finally modernizing public safety communication tools that have been a bit stagnant for decades. And our momentum in newer categories like drones and robotics continues to accelerate with our recently closed acquisition of Dedrone, which helped enable Campbell PD as you saw, to gain the first FAA approval waiver for 24/7 drone operations as first responder. To summarize, I'm very excited about what we are seeing in the market today and the energy our customers have put behind what we are doing. We're on a multi-year journey to modernize the way public safety operates and the opportunity in front of us is to drive real improvement in outcomes that matter to our communities and to our customers who work tirelessly every day to make the world safer. While we report our results to you on a quarterly basis, I believe our success is measured in years and lives saved. We remain focused on our moonshot goal and our mission to protect life and we're thankful to have you on this journey with us. And with that I'll turn it over to Josh Isner. So thanks a lot for the question. I really appreciate it. In terms of Draft One, yes, we did receive some orders in Q3, from kind of early customers. So there was some impact on revenue from Draft One. But I would still say we're in like the top of the first inning on what that's going to look like moving forward, especially as we go into next year with Draft Rule One being the anchor product of our AI Era bundle. And so certainly we're very, very bullish on Draft One and all of our AI products contributions to both revenue and profitability over time. But we're still not yet seeing a major impact on the quarter-to-quarter results which is expected due to the SaaS accounting. It continues to grow, especially after IACP. So we're again and we're converting some of that pipeline into the new kind of AI Era bundle that we're coming out with next year as well. And again, Draft One is really the kind of central driver of interest in that bundle along with a number of other AI features where developing right now. So certainly safe to say that the interest is the most we've seen out of any, year one product. Sure. So right now Draft One alone is $65 a month and it requires transcription on top of that for another 20. So at 85 a month for just Draft One, we're looking at the AI Era bundle price of 199 and the sum of the parts of that bundle is expected to be somewhere around $250 or $350 in terms of everything included in it. So good economics for buying, as a group of features instead of individual standalone features. But that'll be the price going into next year. And those are just the launch features. Of course, the features in the AI Era plan are going to grow, rapidly. That's right. And of course, pretty much everything in that plan are pure SaaS software additions on top of our overall software. ARR. Of course, they build upon people who have our hardware like cameras and TASERS and the like. But the Era plan itself is all good old SaaS. Sorry, I have myself on mute. First, Jonathan, are you cheating on us with the headphone listening to another earnings call at the same time? Awesome. Hey, so, yes, we see drones as a huge opportunity. The Dedrone acquisition, we think, is a real key part of that. Because before you can start flying drones without extra humans standing around watching them, you've got to be able to see your airspace. And an array of sensors can see the airspace far better than a human on a rooftop. And so part of our assessment in making the Dedrone acquisition was a dual bet, number one, that it would be a key enabler for DFR. To be able to fly your own drones, you got to be able to see the airspace well. And then the second is that we're going to see increased interest in counter drone capabilities. I just learned this past week that apparently somebody in Pennsylvania put a pipe bomb on a drone and is going to fly it into critical infrastructure or something. We'd be glad to see, there has not been that much of that kind of activity here in the U.S. but it's certainly growing all over the world and we certainly hope it doesn't come here. I think it is something that's likely to get more nefarious use. And right now, counter drone is really limited to federal agencies, meaning, state and local cannot interdict the drones themselves. So Dedrone is helpful in that case because it will tell you where the pilot is and you can go deal with the pilot directly. However, there was a bill in Congress, I believe, this year. I don't think it's going to make it through, but there have been some efforts to give state and local law enforcement the ability to interdict drones. Not to get into politics, but my assessment of the shift of the election we're coming out of is that that is likely to speed up law enforcement enabling legislation, potentially including the local ability for law enforcement to interdict drones. So Dedrone is a tech enabler. I think Skydio is a partner. We sort of made a shift with the shifting relationship. DJI, you know, is a Chinese drone manufacturer. We think there's legislation afoot that passed the House of Representatives unanimously that's going to be blocking DJI long term and frankly all Chinese drones. And so we shifted our focus really with Skydio, who turns out is the world leader in autonomy already for drones that can fly themselves effectively. So we think between the partnership, the acquisition of Dedrone and then some pending legislative changes, I would expect within 24 months we'll see a shifting landscape to where our state and local folks can begin using more aggressive counter drone capabilities. And by the way, last thing I'll say is we did a full scan of the, of the world's sort of counter drone providers a few years ago before we selected Dedrone. And we liked Dedrone strategy. They were very focused on detection and not getting too aggressive on mitigation. Knowing that, basically owning the detection space and being at a lower cost point than some of the competitors that have been out there focused on more military style interdiction efforts has given them a good footprint to scale from. And then the strategy has been able to plug in other hardware over time as the legal landscape changes. But they, they do compete for the top slot. And it does make me proud that the old warhorse that's TASER can still, can still run. So we -- I think we've got so many things that have the opportunity to continue -- to be disruptive and to grow. The big one for TASER, just to come back on that to me is really international. I think we are on the cusp and actually I'm getting text updates from my engineers that are in the lab today actually working on some pretty cool stuff related to TASER that we think we have the opportunity in the next couple of years to become the primary weapon internationally. Now in the U.S. the gun is going to remain primary for quite a while culturally because police are dealing with so many guns out in the public. But in much of the world, a gun is just if you had a viable, high reliability alternative and for within that 45 foot range, and I'll just tell you the last thing we're working on is clothing penetration. Once we get that dialed in, we've got a shot at becoming the primary self-defense weapon in international markets where there's not a high propensity of handguns out in the public. And I think that could be a real game changer for TASER. Sure. Yes. Certainly reiterating that I'm very confident and encouraged here in terms of what we're going to do in Q4 bookings. Probably won't give you a specific number other than we expected to exceed last quarter. And I think on the last call I said the sum of Q3 and Q4 this year will be comparable to what we did in the full year last year in terms of bookings. So we're very bullish on bookings. Part of what's informing that confidence is just tremendous execution across all four segments of the business, state and local, enterprise, federal and international. We have meaningfully meaningful deals in all four of those segments in Q4 and in a lot of them such that there's no, there's not, it's not like a huge percentage of the bookings would be concentrated on one deal. We feel really, really good about the foundation and we're excited to talk in more detail about our Q4 bookings in February. It really is broad based. I think the about Jeff was at six, seven months ago, I just come back from a tech conference and told Jeff we need to pull the emergency brake and take a look at all of our product development plans and look at where AI would enable new features that weren't even on our, you know, on our visibility list a year ago. Not the emergency brake. Well, no, this is the one where you're in reverse and you pull the brake. It's like the Duke's a hazard. Anyway, it was, it was a pretty big shift and for example, one that came out of that. We also, I do these AI roundtables. Well, they're customer roundtables, but we did one really focused on AI and one thing that became very clear was being able to do real time translation on a body camera would be just insanely valuable. It rated at the top of the charts and so we pivoted. Jeff, basically, you can imagine like how disruptive this is to his days managing like a thousand 1500 engineers. And it's like, hey, hold on, I know we've got everything planned and everybody's working but let's like disrupt everything. And I think that enabled us to talk about six or seven major eight new AI features by IACP already. And I'm really proud, companies at our scale, it's hard to move like that. But I think that, so our customers are seeing again things that just feel almost magical, that are possible with AI and our investment in things like our EAC, our ethics Advisory Council to help us do safety testing on things like Draft One. Just simply running tests to see if you change the race of the subject. Does that pick up any historical bias from the global data set that these models are trained on? And, and we did pick up some things like word choice, if it says the man fled the scene versus the man left the scene, can really change the emotional perception of that statement. And so we did things like tuning down the word choice severity so that our AI writes the most boring police report it can write because it's a human's job to add emotion and tone to it. Anyway, I think that that focus has really rejuvenated interest in the real time connectivity of body cameras. You all may remember a few years ago we had this whole debate about when we were developing AB3, should we put a wireless chip, a cellular LTE chip in the camera? Our customers were telling us they actually, not only were they not interested in it, they were skeptical of it. We were hearing things like, oh, I don't want my boss watching me real time and micromanaging me from the field. And we still said, just, it may not be, maybe they don't want to real stream real time video, but there's going to be something they're going to want to do. And so not only did we decide to put the, the LTE chip in the camera, we decided to put it in every camera. We made a decision not to sell a camera without it because we knew our customers, if we had a cheaper camera without the thing they didn't know they needed yet, that's the one they would buy. And there was some short term pain because our cost of goods crept up. And as maybe, our customers are on these upgrade plans where they get the next camera and we don't get to charge them anymore for it. So eating, an $80 bomb increase on the hopes and dreams that we would find, a value for that was a bit of a risky bet. Well, now that's really coming home to roost because things like Draft One are only possible because of that real time connectivity, real time translation, only possible because of that real time connectivity. So I think we're now reaping the gains of, of some of those bets we made historically. And it's across the portfolio. I don't think there's any one thing that's what makes this just so exciting. I mean, it makes Jeff's job so difficult and Brittany's, because I'm throwing a thousand features at Jeff and he's like, hold on, slow it down. We got to like rationalize the sequencing and when we're going to build things and what are the things that are going to be delightful to use out of the gate now that aren't going to overset customer expectations. And of course, Brittany is, well, making sure that we're holding the line on how much we're spending on all this stuff. Hey, Jamie, was your question specific to international at all or was that. Yes, for sure. Everything's optional, but we might as well answer that one as well. So on International, look, as you know, in searching for a new CRO, our big priority was upping our game internationally. And Cameron Brooks has come in really early on this year, hit the ground running and has really just helped up our game in terms of the quality of the team, the quality of the execution, how we're executing now, but also building for the future. And I think just across the board, we've got some new players on the team that, that are really good kind of free agent signings. We've got a lot of customer momentum from the work that's been done in the last couple of years. And we're starting to, frankly, just see things come together at a, at a more polished level. There's still a long way to go. There's still a huge tam out there. Everything's going to take time internationally, just due to the fact you're dealing with federal governments in all of these countries, not, state and local police forces that, that are able to operate semi autonomously. So it's still going to be a grind, but we really, really believe we're on the right track. And it's a tribute to kind of the team we're building here, led by Cameron. You got it, Jamie. Thanks. Yes, I appreciate the question, Jordan. I'd say the first thing that I want to make really clear is like, we have a very apolitical culture at Axon. We know we've got to be successful in a Democratic administration as well as a Republican administration. And, we've seen that over the last 10 years with both parties being in power and the business continuing to grow. Of course there are going to be some interesting opportunities for us in the new administration that's focused, primarily on border security. We're excited about how we can help there and new capabilities that we can bring to the table to offer support on that. But at the high level, certainly we believe look like saving lives, driving transparency in delivering disruptive technologies to governments and public safety agencies around the world. Those are things that are really not specific to which party is in power. And we're really focused on just delivering the best products we can. Yes, thanks a lot, Josh. On the first question regarding FedRAMP, look like we've invested a lot and we've put a lot of effort into being a FedRAMP high product in the federal government. No question about that. And that's certainly a differentiator for us. But I would be so bold as to say even if everybody was on FedRAMP, we're still winning the majority of deals in state and local where we're competing against the same companies without FedRAMP. And so I think it's more of a tribute to the team's quality product delivery and the federal team's phenomenal execution on the sales and more importantly, the support front for our, for our federal law enforcement customers. And so the team's done a nice job this year. There's, as I said, my -- in my remarks, there's a lot to still close in Q4. We could have a better Q4 than Q3, in the federal space, which is generally uncommon because of the end of the budget year at the end of Q3. And so we'll have to see where the dust settles. But certainly exciting double digit growth from federal and a lot of conviction that we're on the right path there. Sure, if I could start first just Dedrone by itself without DFR ton of interest internationally. I mean every country in the world is now thinking about how they're going to deal with drone threats in the past 24 months. And in many cases AD brought just a great capability. He's the CEO at Dedrone and he's brought us new customers too. Whether it was the World cup in Qatar, the NFL stadiums, critical infrastructure. And then we've seen the same thing with Fusus. I mean both of these acquisitions, these were two big bites for us to take, this closely together. And it's, it's been really just impressive how much customer interest there has been in those with Fusus that's really supercharged our enterprise customers. Enterprises want to be able to work collaboratively with public safety and Fusus becomes the backbone of doing that in real time. Dedrone, we think there's, there's more -- it's a new angle into military customers for us. Militaries around the world are very interested in how you deal with these small first person or Mavic style drones, critical infrastructure and then enterprise there as well. So I'd say Dedrone, even on its own is I think not only interesting to our existing customers, but frankly probably even more interesting to the new customer sets they're bringing to us. The DFR is what's making counter drone especially relevant. When I survey our customers in state and local, the responses are, yes, we're kind of interested in counter drone, but that's not really our mission set today to be dealing with hostile drones coming in. Now that for us is more of a future bet that that's going to come on your plate as those threats grow. But the DFR thing is here and now. That's where our customers really light up. Oh, if I can use Dedrone to enable DFR, I want to be able to fly my own drones. Not something I can do today, but I've got to do it in this awkward way where I've got to have people standing on rooftops and it's kind of this manual kludgy thing and we make it much safer and less kludgy by putting a Dedrone sensor up there. So I also am getting interest, where was it we had another DFR use case in one of our other markets. That's not drone as a first responder, but for competitive reasons. I don't want to name which sector it is, but this is a non-law enforcement sector and they don't need to be flying drones as first responder. But boy, they sure would like to be able to fly drones on an automated patrol around their facilities. And so our partnership with Skydio and the acquisition Dedrone and all that really come together naturally for us to be able to service a lot more than just drone as a first responder for police. If you want to fly a drone without having to have manual human overseers on site, like, we can take that. And by the way, Skydio is a partner as well. Brings us into potentially new customers in critical infrastructure and elsewhere where we haven't been historically. Thanks, Jeremy. It was nice to see many of you at IACP. Thanks for making the trip out there and always great to see you at the booth. All right, so I have two things I want to conclude on. One, I want to be careful. In my previous statement when I talked about the election results, I'm not talking about which party won where. I'm talking about the overall political environment. For example, in California, voters approved Proposition 36 that basically raised the penalties for shoplifting in certain drug crimes. We're seeing a general shift that manifested in this election, swinging the pendulum, more supportive of public safety in general. And I would say at our company we are violently non-partisan. We have passionate gun control advocates and passionate second amendment gun owners who come to meetings together and are productive. And you could say that across all the divisive issue in politics, and I think Josh in particular has done a great job from setting the tone from leadership perspective that we want to be an intellectually diverse place that where everyone is welcome and we keep the divisive stuff out of the office because we've got a job to do and we do best when the best, brightest, smartest, most passionate people, no matter their political views, feel like this is a place where they can come and do their best work. And then the other thing I wanted to say was, you know, Brittany, two years. It's flown by the. What you're seeing right now. I mean, we see a lot of Britney's fingerprints on the P&L. She really does a great job of just driving both operating and financial rigor. I come back from customers with all sorts of ideas. Some people might say they're crazy and some of them are. And between Brittany and Jeff, they've got to figure out, okay, how do we. How do we sort through what we're actually going to execute on what's actually going to go into a product? You see Jeff give me a thumbs up. He said it's a great Rick, this is really fuzzy idea. And that his idea is to take it from fuzzy to concrete and for Brittany to work with the team, make sure we can make this stuff and execute and make money at it. And then, you know, Josh, the other key member of the team here, he's our Jimmy Johnson. And as a lifelong Cowboys fan, as I'm sure he'll appreciate that reference, he is our head coach and really focuses on just building the team and the people, and that is the magic that we're seeing now is we've got these awesome, productive, dynamic tensions between our team as we each have different strengths and weaknesses and that, through the whole organization you're just seeing a phenomenal execution. And I would also say, hey, you're the ownership is part of this team as well. So we appreciate our shareholders and the analysts who take the time to get to know us over the years and are supportive of us using our shareholders capital to go solve these problems that we're excited and interested to go do that fundamentally we believe make the world a better place when we're done. And that motivates everybody to come to work excited. Well, I should have made a bet whether I could get that by without comment. All right, so thanks everybody. Thanks to our team, those people listening on the phone, what a phenomenal quarter. And we're really excited to talk to you after the first year. Everybody have a fantastic holiday season. Hug your kids and your family. Hopefully the world's going to get a little less crazy over the next couple years. And it's been over the last few with what's been happening in the Middle East and Ukraine and it's been just so much violence in the world. I self admittedly was maybe too optimistic in my 2017 or 18 book the End of Killing that thought we were at the end of war. Been proven, sort of. The thesis was wrong in terms of timing, but I do think humanity can do better and we can find ways to deal with threats while minimizing the loss of life. And we're going to stay true to that mission. So thanks everybody, enjoy the holidays, we'll see you next year."

            "name": "Brittany Bagley",
            "content": "Thank you, Josh. This quarter marks two years for me at Axon and the business has certainly been incredible. I couldn't be more pleased to share the results of another great Q3. We grew revenue 32% year-over-year and delivered strong adjusted EBITDA with a 26.7% margin. We achieved this margin expansion while driving over 30% top line growth and we continue to successfully prioritize balancing the bottom line with achieving that strong top line growth that we promise. As Rick and Josh both talked about, the focus on product innovation and delivering for our customers remains our north star and is what enables us to keep delivering these types of results. Thank you to everyone on our team who drives that focus. As we get into the details, I am particularly excited that the revenue growth is broad based in terms of products and customer verticals. Josh spoke to the strength we're seeing across different customers. The strength is across our products as well. For example, our acquisition of Fusus has been very positive across a number of our verticals and TASER 10 also continues to exceed our expectations on its adoption. TASER revenue was a standout in the quarter, growing 36% year-over-year, the strongest growth in our TASER segment in more than two years on the back of increased capacity and broad based demand. Cloud and services was up 36% year-over-year with software revenue as the primary driver. ARR of $885 million is up 36% year-over-year and our net revenue retention, an indicator of growth with our existing and new customers, increased to 123%. Sensors and other revenue was up 18% year-over-year with strong demand for Axon Body 4 partially offset by Fleet. Fleet continues to be a very strong product, but given RFP timing and customer deployment schedules, we expected to have inconsistent hardware revenue quarter-to-quarter. Overall, our future contracted revenue sits at approximately $7.7 billion exiting the quarter which is up 33% year-over-year. As a reminder, this is a gap definition of our remaining performance obligations and will not tie exactly to commentary we share about bookings. Bookings are also seasonally strongest for us in Q3 and Q4 and as Josh shared, we're continuing to see that this year with a strong Q4 in front of us. Adjusted gross margin of 63.2% was stable sequentially and up approximately 50 basis points from last year. Overall, as we have ramped automation and efficiency in our TASER 10 manufacturing, we have stabilized our margins and expect to maintain these approximate levels subject to the usual business mix dynamics. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.7% was a three year record driven by operating leverage as we delivered scale on strong revenue. One note on our financials that you will see in our forthcoming 10-Q is that we have made a revision to our historical financials to reflect corrections of certain areas related to the categorization of some of our partner relationships as principal instead of as agent. We concluded that these were not material to any previously issued financial statements. Our current period reported financials and revised historical financials reflect revenue and expense recognition consistent with the corrections we made in the revision. Now turning to our guidance, we are pleased to raise guidance again on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Our Q4 revenue guidance is a range of $560 million to $570 million representing more than 30% growth at the midpoint. This implies approximately $2.07 billion in full year revenue or greater than 32% annual growth, up from our prior guidance of $2 billion to $2.05 billion or 29.5% growth. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the fourth quarter is a range of $130 million to $135 million or approximately 23.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. This implies full year adjusted EBITDA dollars of approximately $510 million or 24.6% margin. Note that Q4 implies lower adjusted EBITDA margins than we were just able to achieve in Q3, which is a result of timing on some of our expenses and also reflects a full quarter of our now closed Dedrone Acquisition and costs to integrate. We continue to have conviction in our margin target of 25% for 2025 which continues to show nice leverage over full year 2024. Overall, we are very pleased with our progress against the 3-year targets we set out for 2025. We are on pace to deliver our initial $2 billion revenue target for 2025 a full year early and remain confident in our extended target of 20% or greater annual growth, all while increasing our adjusted EBITDA margins and achieving the 25% target next year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to take any questions. And I would probably just note that we'll, we'll probably. You'll hear us talking more and more about the AI bundle plan and less and less and about Draft One as sort of an individual product or an individual data point. It's really going to, as Josh said, be the anchor product in the new AI bundle. We'll continue to add features there, but that's what you'll hear us talking about quarter-to-quarter. Just from a detailed sort of modeling perspective. I don't know that I would expect every quarter to be as strong as this quarter was. This was a particularly strong quarter for TASER and that is partly because we got more capacity online for the TASER business, which helps us go fulfill all of that demand. So just from a growth standpoint, I would say this quarter really stood out and it continues to be across both T10 and our T7 and legacy handles. So that was a little bit unique. But everything Rick and Josh said about the long term trajectory the power of T10, the ability to sell it into different markets, holds over, over the long-term. There's been a couple of questions now about like, what's, what's going to do better or what's going to drive the growth going forward. I think one of the things that I like so much that this quarter demonstrates is the growth is across the board. So you, you might get a little more from one segment one quarter and a little more from another segment, another quarter, but really across the business. The devices on the strength of AB4, TASER on the strength of TASER 10, and then our software, on the strength of both our existing software businesses continuing to perform well, and then the very bright future that we think the AI plan has will continue to drive software. And so, you'll see a slightly different mix every quarter. But as you look long-term, you really should expect all three of those pieces to continue driving our growth. Yes, so we've actually done a pretty good job hitting our expense targets and our OpEx targets. And then our revenue has outperformed. And so what you're really seeing is, some nice flow through on that higher top line revenue coming through to the bottom line. And it's been really nice to see how the team has been able to scale and get some leverage out of the, out of the OpEx and especially on the SG&A side. When we look at Q4 though, we also expect that some of the benefit has been timing right. Like we've been talking about timing. Not everything hits exactly the quarter. So we've been a little bit behind on some of our expense spend as we've gone through the first three quarters. We expect to catch up on some of that in Q4. And then the other thing is we expect to have a full quarter of Dedrone and some of the integration costs associated with Dedrone in Q4 now that we have closed that deal. Yes, so we've certainly lived in an environment of tariffs before. And so I think our philosophy is generally to be pretty flexible. We've got multiple sources. From a supplier standpoint, we do, we manufacture our TASERS like in the U.S. so then it'll really be on component parts as those come in. So look, we'll just work through it and we'll be flexible and be nimble as those come through and as we see what they are. Yes, for sure. I mean, we, as we talk about capacity, we have both cart capacity and handle capacity. And as you can imagine we're working to bring both of those up to meet the demand. We see there are lead times. We do have automation equipment. So it's not, we can't always turn on as much supply immediately as we would like to. So you can see the results of us getting more supply on this quarter. And then again, the growth was particularly impressive this quarter. I want to temper everyone's expectations on that looking the same every quarter. But yes, we'll keep bringing capacity on as we continue to see demand increase. Thank you. I would break it out. Necessarily, Keith what I would say is we've had incredible demand. Like, our demand has been outpacing our capacity. And so as that demand grows, every quarter, we need to bring more capacity on. And so what you saw this quarter was the combination of the two. But I wouldn't say, it's not like we chewed through backlog or something like that to deliver. You're just seeing the ability for us to ship more into that demand. Yes, great, Great question. I think there's two pieces in that one. There's a little bit of a lag in that step as you go through each quarter. So what we really booked in Q3 will show up in Q4. So a little bit of what you're seeing in the step in the quarter is sort of what was going on in Q2 from a booking standpoint. And that's because many of the bookings come in pretty late in the quarter. So the revenue from that doesn't necessarily get captured in our actual number. Then the other piece that's going on in there is that's both our software step and our services business. And so with some of the deployments of our fleet hardware being down in the quarter, which you can see in the fleet number, we actually had less professional services associated with fleet, and so that's actually offsetting some of the software piece. So if you were just looking at software, you would see a larger step than what's coming through and in the number you're actually seeing, because we actually had a step down in PSO, which is atypical. Normally, PSO is growing and software is growing, but because fleet came down this quarter, you're seeing that dynamic. Yes, I mean, we really look at that sort of on an average basis. Like, I think because of the dynamics I just talked about of timing of when bookings come in a quarter, looking at any one quarter is not as good as sort of averaging out over the year. And you do have things like seasonality playing into that. So I would say nothing underlying it that would change our, sort of four to six quarter average on anything. The step on ARR growth on any of that. You're just seeing a little bit of timing and a quarterly lag is what's showing up in Q3 is really Q2. What will show up in Q4 is really what we're talking about with strength in Q3. And then what will show up in Q1 will be whatever we deliver in Q4. Yes, I can maybe start with cartridge because that's easy. And then if Josh wants to talk more about TASER, he can. So most of our TASER customers are on sort of a cartridge deployment plan, which smooths out, how you see cartridge revenue come in. But we do have international customers who are not on a plan. And so what you'll see is every now and then our cartridge revenue is particularly lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And so last quarter we had some big international customers come in and place cartridge orders, and then those didn't repeat this quarter. So again, I'd look at a longer trend line of cartridge growth versus last quarter to this quarter. And then I think the only other thing I would add maybe to give a little more color on TASER before I let it go over to Josh, is, last quarter, in his script, Josh talked a bit about how much demand we're seeing for TASER 10 relative to TASER 7. I think he said demand is sort of 2x the pace. But we are still seeing really good performance from TASER 7. And so part of what you're seeing in this quarter is not only are you getting all of those benefits from TASER 10 that we've been talking about, but we do still have customers ordering TASER 7 and some of our other legacy TASER handles and products. And so, that that's sort of combining to give a particularly nice result."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Thanks a lot Rick and good afternoon everybody. This week we are participating in a core element of our culture at Axon, putting our customers first together. It is the week of the customer internally where we invite customers into work to share their stories, recognize our internal support teams and double down on employee in on employee training to ensure that the customer remains at the center of our universe. I'd like to share a quick anecdote to that end. In response to the devastating hurricanes that impacted the southeastern U.S. in September and October, we deployed our Axon Aid emergency Response Team to work alongside first responders around the clock for 16 days. Our team got to witness the magnitude of customer's efforts firsthand. At Axon we know our customers are heroes and being a small service to them in this mission was an honor and nothing short of inspirational. We work every day to help our customers achieve better outcomes and when we put their needs first, we get to share in their successes. Understanding this is something I have spent a lot of time on and it percolates into how we've built our team. When I look at what our team is working on with our customers and the results we are delivering because of our strong partnership with them, I continue to be excited and impressed. I'll briefly share a few updates that build my confidence. First, our record results. We just delivered our 11th consecutive quarter, growing above 25% in our third quarter this year growing above 30%. That growth puts us at a level where we are accomplishing in quarters what took us years to do only a few years ago. Second, while we've been growing fast, we still have line of sight to a multiyear growth opportunity that continues to build. We closed Q3 with record bookings in excess of $1 billion on both an absolute and normalized five year basis. That's our strongest normalized booking quarter in history outside of Q4 last year. As we move to close out this Q4, which has historically been our strongest bookings quarter, we are already executing against the largest pipeline we've ever had and we fully expect to post an exceptional and record result again. Third, what's really encouraging here is that we are seeing strength across the board. Our state and local business is firing on all cylinders, led by Jessica Duncan and the early interest we are seeing in our AI Era plan signals to me that this new offering could be one of the more meaningful drivers for us in the year to come. Beyond our state and local business, our U.S. Federal bookings came in higher than what we did in a full year just a few years ago, with four of our top 10 domestic deals in the quarter coming from federal customers across several agencies including DHS, IRS and Amtrak. Looking ahead, we have a clear path to surpass the Q3 federal bookings again in Q4 for our strongest year yet. International bookings came in at near record levels, matching Q4 of last year up 40% sequentially from Q2 and our year-to-date international bookings are up 40% from last year. Similar to federal we see a clear path to surpass Q3 bookings again in Q4. Finally, we saw strong bookings from corrections customers from our in our justice segment continued to grow and we have several Fortune 500 companies conducting retail security trials with Axon products in the Enterprise segment. As is the case every Q4, we must do two things well. Number one, close out the year with maximum intensity and flawless execution and number two, ensure that we are well prepared to drive a record 2025. We have a lot of sharp, adaptable and unstoppable teammates that are embracing this challenge. I know I say this a lot, but I truly believe Axon is in the strongest position we've ever been. We have an immense opportunity ahead to grow our business and continue to progress toward our moonshot goal, which we will pursue with vigor. Now I'll pass it over to Brittany to go over everything in more detail. Brittany? Rick, do you want to start and I'll pile on. And then Jon, I just add two things on Rick's great summary. One thing that we're super pumped about is how the market's evolving to think about the real time crime center space and the DFR space together, which we think is both right and good for agencies and communities. And plays right into our strengths and our differentiation as a solution. So the combination of fusus in the real time crime center deeply connected with all of our other devices, and then into the DFR partnership stuff that Rick was just talking about, agencies are thinking about buying those together and that's both great for them as they think about how they use this technology to keep community safe. And it plays right into all of Axon strengths. And the second, which is another example of that same thing, we just had a major agency who is in the middle of rolling out their DFR stuff the other day, talk unprompted about the notion of they would love to have an officer be able to press that watch me button that we have on our AB4 cameras and have that under the right conditions, automatically trigger the dispatch of a DFR drone to bring help and extra overwatch to that situation even faster than what any other human in the loop could be. And that's exactly the kind of solution that's powered by the combination of all the things we bring to bear for agencies. And I might just add one or two more thoughts there about the question of is this sustainable for the TASER business to keep growing? In my opinion, the answer is absolutely yes. Like we're year two of five in an upgrade cycle right now. We continue to see exceptionally strong demand, literally double what it was, as we've said on previous calls, you know, with T7. And so certainly a lot of runway ahead to continue to grow the TASER business. And look like, as Rick said, the TASER business is going to solve one of the most critical issues in policing over the long-term, which is that these encounters can end in death either from a civilian or, a police officer. And if we can solve that problem, I still think we're scratching the surface of what the TASER business is capable of. So, Mike, the question was how fast can we get to 85 adoption on T10 versus T7. Okay, look, I think that would be setting our sights short, I would say. Our goal is to transition every T7 and legacy model TASER into a T10. And we, we think we have an opportunity to do that. I think this, this TASER 10, while, while each TASER is an incremental improvement over the last one, TASER 10 is just a fundamental, massive leap forward in the technology, in the de-escalation capabilities, in the officer safety features. We really believe that, every cop will be best served with a TASER set with a TASER 10. I'm sorry. And certainly as we go into the next few years here of the, of the TASER 10 life cycle, the primary goal is upgrade and replacement of the current fleet. And again, we're very confident in our ability to do that. Thank you. I'd say you're thinking about that incorrectly. Yes, sure. Look, I certainly appreciate the question, Joe. And these deals that are going to be closed in Q4 are deals that, generally a 6 to 12 month sales cycle at a minimum. Right. These things take the full year to come together. We talk in Q1 when bookings are seasonally light. Traditionally that part of that is the team is getting their arms around the new products and the new pricing, getting their arms around their new book of business as the territories can change and so forth. And so that's really where the groundwork goes into, like building the pipeline for the rest of the year. And naturally most of that closes in Q3 and Q4, especially when you see some of the biggest budgets in the country, the federal government, Florida, Texas, all ending on September 30th you get a lot of September action and then you get a lot of new budget dollars being spent in Q4. And so I don't know that the AI bundle is going to have a major impact on Q4 since we launched it in the same quarter. And we're still building the pipe for the long-term for some of our newer features and products. So the big driver of a lot of these deals is officer safety plan execution in the state and local market and some large deals and international, federal and enterprise that have been coming together over the course of several quarters. So certainly expect, Q4 to really trump Q3 in terms of just the absolute dollars and the normalized bookings. But it's also the result of a lot of pipeline building that happened throughout the year. And I might just add one more thought on adjusted EBITDA, just high level, which is the thing I'm most excited about, is the fact that we are not sacrificing R&D to achieve these results. Right. Like that's that, it would be very easy to drive up adjusted EBITDA by mortgaging the future. And I don't think anyone feels that way right now. We're still in the place of just loading up on new opportunities and investing relentlessly in them. We're just seeing, like Brittany said, over delivery and a lot more discipline in SG&A as well. So it was one just thought, I think again, it's what so many of the things that are a Goldilocks [ph] and magical, I think about Axon's flywheel, for lack of a better phrase, connecting like the questions about what's happening with bookings or demand, like right now. And then everything Rick's talking about the future is. It's all of our new innovations are really leading indicators of this time, next year's growth. Not about this quarter's growth because of the sales cycle stuff, because of building stuff, but they feed into customers excitement about their bet on Axon for the long-term. But the bookings that are, this quarter, next quarter are about the pipe, as Josh talked about that got that got laid nine months ago. And it all connects in that ongoing sequence, feeding upon itself in a really virtuous, virtuistic way that we're super excited about. You're going to actually answer the question he asked. Yes. And I just add, you know, Jeremy, I'd say it's in part due to international. Certainly it's a big TAM. We're getting better there. We're building relationships kind of with the right customers. We're doing a better job explaining and demonstrating the value that TASERS bring to police, both in terms of lives saved, but also in terms of officer safety increasing and workers comp decreasing and just some of the issues that come along with absence of TASER deployments. But I think the bigger thing is just very simple. We have phenomenal product market fit with this product. And that's really a credit to Rick. Like our customers are for the first time really seeing that, man, this thing is on track to outperforming a firearm in the field. And we had been talking about it for a long time, but for 30 years with only up to two shots that was still kind of a pipe dream. And now we're seeing it with 10 shots. And customers are saying, man, the increased distance of 45feet combined with the number of shots, combined with the better penetration, those are all things that I think are inspiring more confidence in the device from our customers, whether they be in state and local or federal or international. And so I think that's really it. It's like good sales execution with a product that has, you know, phenomenal product market fit. So Rick, I would have appreciated a Belichick comparison over Jimmy Johnson, but we'll let that one slide."

Now, turning to our quarterly update. First, we'll start off with a quick video to share some of the feedback that we've gotten from early users of Draft One. It'll be just two minutes. So, let's pull it up. [Video Presentation]\nRick Smith: All right. Thanks, Erik, and thanks to all of you, our shareholders and analysts, for joining us today. Welcome to Axon's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am again proud to report another great quarter and to show you that video to highlight some of the incredible outcomes our team is delivering to our customers with Draft One. Our story is to build a world where we help our customers achieve better outcomes every day, and it still feels like we're just at the beginning. There are two things that I believe are critical to our success and ability to differentiate in the market. We move fast and we take risks. It is our speed and willingness to tackle the toughest problems that drives our innovation and allows us to recruit the best people. I think we're at the forefront in several technological areas that will define the next decade for our company. You've probably heard me talk about them before. First and possibly the most significant is artificial intelligence. We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications to our customers. We've been at this for many years and our progress is accelerating as the underlying technology and the interest to adopt reaches critical mass here in the US and around the world. One year ago, I shared with you our vision for generative AI applications as we saw commercially available LLMs, large language models, coming to the market. I told you we would be ready to catch the ball. Well, in April, we launched Draft One, a powerful new AI service that writes the first draft of a police report, extracted directly from Axon Body camera recordings. Our customers' response to Draft One is better than anything I've seen, better than we could have imagined. They want to put more data into the cloud with Axon, they want to better access that data, and they trust us to protect their data. And they can see that we can help them do their jobs better, put their data to use. Our unique position to define this category comes down to three key advantages that I believe we hold. One, the sensor network. We run the largest sensor ecosystem by far, including tasers, body cameras, in-car cameras, drones, robotics, and third-party cameras and sensors through Fusus. This vast network generates the data needed to drive the future of AI. Second is the data. Our expansive ecosystem of software and sensors has generated the industry's largest and most valuable data set. Now it's not our data, our customers own their data, and we protect it rigorously, and we provide them the tools they need to manage and leverage their data. We help them make their data accessible and usable, securely managing hundreds of petabytes of audio, video and imagery in the cloud. And third is trust. We work tirelessly. For decades we have to earn our customers' trust. We've led three major tech revolutions: TASER energy weapons, wearable cameras, and cloud software. And we have several more in progress, like virtual reality training, drone as first responder, and real-time sensor fusion. Our customers trust us as their thought partner, guiding them into the future, an AI-driven future. This trust is our most enduring advantage, built over decades, and we are dedicated maniacally to maintaining that trust by being reliable and trustworthy partners. AI is a hot topic right now. And there's concern about the commoditization of the underlying models. Some major tech companies are investing billions of dollars and then open sourcing their models, making some of the LLMs, these foundational models, free and potentially demonetizing the foundation model layer of the AI ecosystem. We believe we are uniquely positioned to leverage our position as the application and network layer to create significant value through time and cost savings that we deliver from the underlying technology through a world-class UI to our customers. By combining top-tier AI models with our sensor and software ecosystem, we can deliver exceptional workflows, all within a secured GovCloud environment. Our AI products not only offer tremendous growth opportunities for us, but also immense value to our customers. Solutions like Draft One, automated license plate reading, transcription, video redaction, these services quickly pay for themselves. I'm particularly excited about upcoming announcements that we have planned for the Annual Police Chiefs Conference, the IACP, in October. So, stay tuned. Our next focus is real-time operations, which we see as a major opportunity. From what we have learned in our work in legacy Dispatch systems, combined with our acquisition of Fusus, we believe we are positioned to redefine real-time communications and real-time operations for our customers. Our strength lies in innovation, not iteration. Therefore, we are shifting. We're pivoting from command-line dispatch console software to instead focus on sensor fusion and AI. This approach will integrate multiple data feeds, both human and technological, into a unified single pane of glass. Strategically, we're refocusing to align our unique innovation capability with the emerging technologies. Acquiring Fusus has given us a platform to accelerate our progress and we are doubling down on this investment. We plan to leverage the fully-integrated Fusus map experience to provide critical real-time information, enhancing decision making, and improving communications. We're excited to embrace this new vision and deliver exceptional results for our customers. Lastly, we remain highly enthusiastic about drones and robotic security. Last year, we acquired Sky-Hero in the tactical robotic space. Recently, we announced an expanded drone as first responder, or DFR, partnership ecosystem with Skydio, Dedrone, and DroneSense, each the leaders in their niche of the ecosystem. This collaboration offers the most advanced and comprehensive solution for drone as a first responder programs. We look forward to completing our acquisition of Dedrone later this year, further expanding our footprint in this dynamic space. I'm excited about what's ahead and see these updates as validation of our strategy. I believe we are uniquely positioned to achieve remarkable outcomes, driving immense value for our stakeholders across the board while solving real-world problems that matter. And with that, let me turn it over to the guy who leads the phenomenal execution you see quarter over quarter. Josh Isner, over to you.\nJosh Isner: Thanks a lot, Rick, and good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to start today's remarks on a personal note. In June, I celebrated my 15th year work anniversary at Axon. In 2009, Axon, the name TASER, was much smaller carrying a market cap of $245 million. It is a testament to Rick's vision and leadership that Axon is in a much different place today both in terms of size and impact. I feel very lucky to have been part of this awesome team for so long, and I'm thrilled to witness the tremendous results driven by such a talented and mission-oriented group of individuals. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered again in Q2, and we feel great about the momentum we are seeing in the second half and beyond. While Rick continues to focus on our vision and make sure that we're headed in the right direction, I continue to focus my time on our execution and ensuring we have the right team to help us achieve that vision over the long term. I have a few updates from the quarter that I am particularly excited to share. First, we achieved record second quarter revenue and bookings. It was our first quarter with over $500 million in revenue, a number that represented our full year revenue just a few years ago. We booked over $1 billion in new business, closed our largest-ever contract with the US state and local customer, closed our largest-ever corrections deal, and we are seeing an uptake in our -- an uptick in our international momentum. Our international bookings are up 100% year-to-date versus last year. And just a couple weeks ago, we signed our largest records contract ever with that segment. Next, I'll briefly share some detail on where we are seeing accelerating demand for our products. Our new introductions over the past year have ignited. TASER 10 is the fastest selling TASER device in our history. Not only is demand pacing at over 2x the rate of TASER 7 on the order side, but we've able -- we've been able to scale shipments each quarter since launch. We've eclipsed more than 100,000 units shipped, and we have a long runway ahead. Something I find particularly encouraging here is that our top four TASER 10 deals have come from customers outside of our US state and local customer base. We have a massive TASER user base within state and local, but we also see strong demand from our customers, in other segments like federal, international, and from corrections customers as well. The order book for TASER 10 is strong across the board. In Q2, we shipped the most body cameras we've ever shipped in a single quarter. Along with TASER 10, Axon Body 4, and our expanding set of premium software, adoption of our Officer Safety Plan is growing as seven of our top 10 domestic deals in the quarter included premium Officer Safety Plan options. Finally, we are seeing the early indicators of success supporting our investments in newer areas within our software business from revenue -- I'm sorry, revenue from productivity, AI products, real-time operations, and drones and robotics drove almost half of the growth in our software revenue in Q2. Early traction within Draft One is a great example. In the three months since launch, Draft One has generated over $100 million of pipeline, the fastest of any Axon software product to do so. We believe demand for products like Draft One will only grow from here. Halfway through the year, we are pleased to be well-positioned to deliver another year of growth and sustained impact. However, we're on to the next play and nobody is letting up. We have a fantastic opportunity to deliver a similar bookings number over the next six months that we achieved in the entire 2023 campaign. The team is relentlessly focused on executing, and we're excited to show what we can do in the second half. Over to you, Brittany.\nBrittany Bagley: Thank you, Josh. As both Rick and Josh highlighted, we had a great quarter. We grew revenue 35% year-over-year on top of 31% growth in the same quarter last year, and we delivered strong adjusted EBITDA. I am particularly impressed that the growth comes from all our business segments, driven by our powerful ecosystem. Our customer-centric approach solves real problems, which drives us to innovate, and you can see those results in the business. Cloud and Services remains the fastest-growing segment at 47% year-over-year. Our software growth stands out and has continued to drive mix shift with 39% of revenue coming from software and services in Q2, up from 35% last year and 29% the year before. TASER 10 and Axon Body 4 also contributed an impressive 28% year-over-year growth in both our TASER and sensors product categories. These products are performing incredibly well and we're still in the early innings. Overall, our future contracted revenue sits at approximately $7.4 billion, which is up 41% year-over-year, and ARR of $850 million is up 44% year-over-year, while maintaining 122% net revenue retention. Along with continuing strength in Axon Evidence, the new products we talk about are helping drive our consistently high NRR. Adjusted gross margin of 62.5% increased by 10 basis points year-over-year. This was supported by mix in our software business, as well as the benefits of automation in our TASER business. We cleaned up some of our older inventory on the sensor side, given the better-than-expected demand for AB4, which was a partial offset to our strong gross margin in the quarter. At this point though, we expect to see stable gross margins for these segments going forward and expect overall gross margin around this level for the remainder of the year. Below the gross margin line, we continue to focus on scaling the business, both to drive profitability and to successfully deliver on our top-line growth. This has included adding a new manufacturing facility to increase production capacity for TASER devices and cartridges, as well as integrating our acquisitions and investing in R&D. We've been able to invest in and grow the business while driving operating efficiency. Increased revenue, gross margin, and operating efficiency drove adjusted EBITDA to $123 million, which was 24.5% margin in the quarter, up 270 basis points year-over-year, and surpassing our highest level in over three years. We also had free cash flow conversion above 60% in the quarter, leading to $75 million of adjusted free cash flow. Turning to our outlook, we are pleased to raise guidance again on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Our full year 2024 expected revenue guidance is increasing to $2 billion to $2.05 billion, which represents 29.5% annual growth at the midpoint. This is up from our prior guidance of $1.94 billion to $1.99 billion, which represented approximately 26% annual growth at the midpoint. And it's a result of the strong performance we saw in Q2 and the strong pipeline in the second half of the year. We expect full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $460 million to $475 million, implying an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.1% at the midpoint. This is up from our prior adjusted guidance of $430 million to $445 million and it expands our expected margin by 80 basis points. The increase in our adjusted EBITDA guidance includes better-than-expected performance in Q2 and our increased expectations for the remainder of the year. Consistent with last quarter, our guidance incorporates an immaterial amount of revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin impact from our planned acquisition of Dedrone, which we still expect to close in the current year. Overall, we saw strength across the board on the P&L, shipped a record number of tasers and body cameras, generated strong cash flow, made additional investments into our drone partnerships and remain on track to close Dedrone, and strengthened our bookings pipeline for the back half of the year to record numbers. I'd say we're quite proud of this quarter, and I want to give a huge thank you to the incredible team we have for making it all happen. And with that, I would like to open it up to questions.\nA - Erik Lapinski: Thanks, everyone. Just a minute till all come up in the gallery view. All right, we're going to start off with Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Hi there. Good afternoon, and congratulations on another quarter of strong results. Can you give us a little bit more color on the adoption of your software applications? And maybe what are some of the biggest contributors now? What are sort of the incremental add-ons where you see the biggest inflection point? I definitely appreciate the AI commentary, but just wanted to get a sense of maybe what's driving the performance this quarter and what you're most excited about going forward?\nBrittany Bagley: I can start and then maybe turn it over to Rick who I know is incredibly excited about this. But we made the call out this quarter that we're both seeing terrific continued growth from our evidence.com product, but we're also seeing increasing contributions to the growth from our other suite of software products, and that's really across the board in those other categories. So, calling out productivity and AI and all of those pieces. We did call out the Draft One. While we're incredibly excited about the pipeline with over $100 million in pipeline, it's not actually yet contributing to the revenue in the quarter. So, continues to be a big area of excitement going forward, but the tremendous increase you're seeing this quarter is really coming from the existing products that we've talked about.\nRick Smith: Yeah. Let me speak briefly. And then, Jeff, I might have you speak a little more in detail as well sort of the breakout of our current software. I tend to focus on the sort of the leading edge, and then as things kind of stabilize -- by the time they're bigger, I'm spending less of my time personally on them, and Jeff is really leading the large teams. Obviously, AI is a really interesting space right now. The -- what is -- what was impossible 18 months ago is now, frankly, easy in some cases. Things like Draft One is nearly magical in the user experience. The first time I turned it on was in, I think, February I got access to it in beta. I was at the Texas Department of Public Safety doing a demo -- actually, I probably shouldn't have given the exact name. Anyways, I was at a large agency in Texas doing a demo, and they were saying, \"oh, there's no way this will work\" with an East Texas accent. And they started teasing each other. And I said, \"Well, I don't know. Let's try it.\" And we had this officer come up, and, literally, this guy could have been on Saturday Night Live. He did the best, like, kind of hillbilly voice skit, was completely non-linear in answering questions, was all over the place. I was sure it was going to be a disaster, and I was just shocked at how well the AI turned all of the nonsense into a professional looking report in, like, literally 15 seconds. And we're seeing that reaction from customers across the board. We had some customers say that the time savings alone from Draft One justifies paying for the entire Officer Safety Plan. So, while it's not -- because of the nature of these things, the -- we write contracts upfront. It takes time for the revenue to kick in. I think Draft One is a real accelerator. It brings transcription. You need to have respond. You have to have the wireless connectivity for us to be able to push this up to the cloud, have it ready in time. So, it pulls other products with it, and then there's a whole suite of other stuff that we are now working on across the board. I would just tell you, Jeff and I sat down, and we said -- we kind of pulled the emergency brake and said across the entire business, every team is now researching what are the AI possibilities that justify changing our priorities so that we're nimble and that we're moving things that our customers couldn't even imagine are now moving to the top -- a year ago, are now at the top of our product development priorities. So with that, Jeff, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add.\nJeff Kunins: Sure. I think both you and Brittany said it well, but thanks, Jonathan, as always, for the question. I mean, I think the beauty of the strength is that it's universal across the diversity of all of our product lines and segments. Whether it is continued growth of core DEMS and more and more access to higher and higher tier plans of, like, unlimited third-party storage and all of those things, whether it's the core add-ons on the back of DEMS, redaction, all of those things, the strength and productivity, like the pipeline for Draft One, but records and standards and core transcription, and, of course, an RTO, the existing strength and respond, the addition of Fusus, and then, VR accelerating and everything across the board. So, I think that the thing that is the most interesting is how universal the growth is across the diversity of our product line.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent. I'll keep it to one question. Thank you.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Jonathan. We'll go to Trevor Walsh at JMP next.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks, team. Appreciate you taking my question. Josh, maybe for you, but feel free anyone else to jump in. Good to see the international bookings up 100% in the quarter. It's a theme you've obviously been talking about for quite a while now. Can you maybe just give us or reiterate kind of the why now? You think that international opportunity is sort of seems to be gaining some speed? And then, depending on how you answer, are there things that might kind of even accelerate that further geopolitical wise or just everything kind of going on kind of globally that might help to either make that -- those dynamics increase or maybe create a headwind if things kind of turns more towards the negative? Thanks.\nJosh Isner: Sure thing. Thanks for the question, Trevor. Well, I'd say it's really the convergence of a couple things that we've been working on for a couple years now. Number one is getting the team right. I think, this is the strongest international team we've had. We've made some new additions to the team in 2024, not only with Cameron Brooks, our CRO, but with some of -- some new leadership in Europe, some new country managers. And I think that's already showing a different level of rigor and intensity than we've had kind of across the board historically. So, very excited about that. I think number two, TASER 10 is really us -- allowing us to start and restart conversations around TASER adoption. And it's driving a lot of interest in a lot of the core markets. I think the market is more -- moving more in the direction of cloud now, especially certain markets internationally. And I think we've been opportunistic there and continue to grow the pipeline. And so, I think those are really the three big things. The last one that is kind of a continual effort is making sure we're focused on the right places. I think at times, historically, we've gone a little off kilter with the volume of opportunities and that's affected our execution. And I think at this point in time, we are really locked in on the places we have strong conviction we can be successful and we're investing in those areas and the team is doing a great job in executing in those geographies. And so, I think all those factors are really contributing to the great results we're seeing internationally. I would say, like, we're still on -- very much in our own territory here, looking down the whole field. We've got a ton of opportunity here. And this is going to be essentially the low point of our international results this year and a ton of opportunity to build on into the future here, especially with the right team in place now. So, very excited about what the future holds for international.\nRick Smith: Hey, Josh. If I could jump in as well, something that's really different in the past three months is AI. I met with a senior -- a very senior government leader in continental Europe in a country where everything I had heard up until now was cloud [indiscernible], just showing Draft One. And look, we're able to film it and do it in French, no problem, because the underlying large language models from OpenAI, like they handle 100 languages without breaking a sweat. And I had this presidential advisor look at me and said, I've never -- like, I've understood the value of the cloud historically. It's been somewhat compelling, but, like, this is a game changer. And when you think about the complexity of deploying AI at scale and the massive GPU clusters you're going to need and the connectivity into the cloud just eases all that. So, we've been almost religious about our cloud fervor. In the US, our customers told us early on the cloud was illegal and that we -- they couldn't do it. Of course, we pressed through that, and now it's become ubiquitous. Europe's been harder. They've been very resistant to the cloud, and we've stuck to our guns, but it's taken a lot longer than we thought. I think this is still theory. We haven't seen a [indiscernible], but the early reactions are AI services like Draft One and some of the new stuff you'll see in a few months, could be enough to tip it over and start to make the cloud sweep through the rest of the world that's been very resistant to it. That'll be a real game changer, if that pans out.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks both. I'll get back in queue.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Trevor. We're going to go up to Josh Reilly at Needham next.\nJosh Reilly: All right. Thanks for taking my questions, and I'll echo the congrats on the, very strong quarter here. I just -- I noticed the sequential growth in ARR was down from last year's $39 million that you added in Q2. Is it simply a matter of timing as you did add a record $93 million in ARR sequentially last quarter from Q1 to -- Q4 to Q1? And I would assume with the commentary that, demand for premium bundles remains pretty robust here?\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah. You got it. It's just timing. It depends on when the new revenue starts turning on in the quarter. And bookings in Q1 were relatively light as we go through the year, and so you just see that rolling into ARR in this quarter. So, I wouldn't read any more into it than that. We're still really happy with the 40%-plus year-over-year growth in that ARR number, and that's what we're looking at.\nJosh Reilly: Got it. That's helpful. And then, the TASER gross margin had a nice bounce back here in Q2. How should we think -- be thinking about the trajectory for the TASER gross margin for the balance of the year? Because I know there's been some swing factors there that maybe we should be considering.\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah. I was happy to say, I think, our margins generally are starting to stabilize around the levels you're seeing them at now, and so that's both inside of our segments and for our overall gross margin. So, hopefully, some of the noise that we've been seeing in past quarters is stabilizing a bit. And I would say some of that benefit you're seeing in the TASER gross margin this quarter is, we've talked about automation coming online, and you're starting to see the benefits of that. So, I think you'll see that benefit going forward. And then, just as we go through the year, mix does always tend to move things up or down a little bit, both inside the segments and for the overall gross margins.\nJosh Reilly: Got it. Thank you. Very helpful.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Josh. We got Joe Cardoso at JPMorgan up next.\nJoe Cardoso: Hey. Thanks for the question, and congrats on the results as well. I guess just one for me and just wanted to follow-up. I think, Josh, last quarter you talked about the best opportunity pipeline you had seen exiting 1Q, and it seems like 2Q topped that, particularly given your bookings or backlog comment heading into the back half. I guess, can you just flesh that out a bit more specifically, like, what's driving your conviction here? Is there any particular parts of the pipeline where you've seen a big pickup as it relates to the portfolio or customer vertical perspective, and that's driving basically this view going into the back half? Thank you.\nJosh Isner: Sure thing. Thanks for the question. Ultimately, the pipeline is very strong. Of course, that's something we track as a company and as a sales team. And it all comes down to just the conviction that we have and how accurate it is. And look, like, we have the best sales team in this industry. The sales team is one of our strongest teams in the company, and I would bet on them all day. And so, I think we are going to have a massive back half in terms of bookings. We see the pipeline everywhere across the business, but more importantly, the names next to the pipeline are names that I have a ton of conviction and belief in, and I think everyone's going to be really pleased to see what the team is -- puts up in Q3 and Q4 here.\nJoe Cardoso: Got it. Thanks. Appreciate the response.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Joe. Up next, we have someone new to us. Welcome, Jordan. We're going to take Jordan Lyonnais at Bank of America.\nJordan Lyonnais: Hey. Thank you guys for taking the question. On the drone market, in particular, the NDAA amendment was added, potentially that can lead to a DJI drone ban. If that were to go through, how does it change your opportunity with partnerships with Skydio?\nRick Smith: Yeah. So, I'll take that one and then see if Jeff needs to clean anything up. We've -- our strategy around drones has been to be very dynamic and flexible. DJI, up until now, has been the market leader, and through our partnership with DroneSense. Basically, DroneSense created piloting and data management software that would be able to use Chinese hardware with US software and data flows, so that it could be more secure, and that's been very successful. I'd say DroneSense is currently the market leader in terms of the number of drones flying on their software. The hardware bans have been instituted in some states already, like Florida, and Skydio is the clear US market leader. They're also the clear leader globally in autonomy, in terms of the drones being able to fly themselves without operator intervention. And so, Jeff really spearheaded the efforts around negotiating this new partnership, combining the best of DroneSense, Skydio, and Dedrone. So, we think we're well positioned either way this pans out. There was a movement towards a federal ban. It looks like that has, at least for now, been paused on DJI. So, we are prepared for either outcome, and we think we've got the best strategy we can that's optimized, and not betting on political outcomes because you can't bet on those. Jeff, anything you'd want to add?\nJeff Kunins: Yeah. Sure. I think hands down, like, we've talked about for multiple quarters, the role of drones and robotics broadly in public safety is another one of these rapidly accelerating rocket ships, and we intend to continue to play a bigger and bigger role in supporting agencies across all of the workloads for drones and robotics that they're doing. And, one of the most important aspects of that is this whole category of DFR, or drones as first responder. And within that, you need the right combination of many elements of the stack. You need the right drone hardware, you need the right piloting and all that stuff, you need the right mission management, you need the right docking infrastructure, and you need the right airspace protection. And so, as Rick just said, we were thrilled to announce this big comprehensive additional partnership together with Skydio, who's unquestionably the leading US hardware manufacturer. And, together with them and us and Dedrone and others, we're, confident that we are, by far, the best end-to-end solution for agencies in the US and steadily over the round of the world there. Plus, we continue to support together with Skydio and our other partners, all of the other workloads that aren't DFR yet in drones, and it's going to keep on growing.\nJordan Lyonnais: Got it. Thank you.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, everyone. Up next, Meta Marshall at Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Rick, maybe, further detail. You guys were talking about that there would be a lot of pull-through of additional kind of products with Draft One. Just can you give a sense of like how you would monetize either other sensors you were bringing in or other amounts of data you were bringing in? Or do you mean that in -- that you would monetize it through product announcements that we'll kind of hear about over the next six months or a year? That's the main question.\nRick Smith: So, the monetization, as of right now, does not rely on any new products. So, in order for Draft One to work, you've got to have our body cameras. And then, with those body cameras, you need Respond+, which is the connectivity layer. You got to turn the service on so that we can wirelessly stream over secure LTE to get the audio up into the cloud, so that by the time you sit down in your patrol car where a lot of officers write their reports, the data is ready. Then, you need our transcription service so that we've transcribed that to feed it into the AI model that's going to write Draft One. And then, what we have seen is the -- so Draft One is opening -- basically causing agencies to open their contracts to add Draft One, and anytime that happens, now you're in a contract rewrite, and of course, that creates an opportunity. This is an interesting industry in that the effort expended just going through a procurement is almost more important than the amount of budgetary dollars. So, once they're in a procurement, I think there's a general customer sentiment of, okay, like, what else should we be looking at now, because if we're going to go through this, let's go through it, let's do our evaluation, and we find that opens their minds to doing more with us. And then, I think also they're aware of the speed at which this is happening, just the level of tech shift that's happening across society. And so we're, I think we're seeing them these OSP packages are a way to sort of derisk these acquisitions for our customers, where they don't necessarily even know how much of the stack they're going to use, kind of like if you sign up for Amazon Prime, like, you may or may not use the free videos, or you may or may not use the different things in there, but across we try to make it easy for them. It's like, \"hey, you don't have to figure it all out. There's a lot to understand here. If you go on the OSP plan, we'll figure it out together what's valuable for you.\" And I think Draft One is just kind of further accelerating that. Josh, is there anything you'd want to add to that?\nJosh Isner: No. I think the beauty -- like Rick just described, is the fact that adopting one product often opens up increased value for the next product to come in and solve an additional problem. So the bridge from respond to transcription to Draft One, and I think we will see that in other parts of the business. Rick mentioned real-time operations and participating in that market to a larger extent. I think there's similar opportunities there between Respond and other AI offerings to drive additional value and solve additional problems. So, I think it really nicely fits together when one solution leads to the next.\nMeta Marshall: Great.\nBrittany Bagley: Meta, the one thing I'd add to that is you asked about new product announcements. I would just say, like, you can imagine given the enthusiasm that Rick and Jeff and the teams are actively working on new products also. And so, like, yes, stay tuned for new areas that we develop and we go into in this in the future.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. And just maybe, Brittany, as a follow-up for you, you guys mentioned international as a particular area of strength, but just any trends between US federal and enterprise and just kind of relative strength during the quarter? And then, I'll hand it off.\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah. I mean, I think that our domestic law enforcement business continues to just put up really incredible numbers and just deliver. And you see that from all of the things that the team has been talking about in terms of the ability to upgrade, to move on to OSP to continue making those migrations, but we are seeing great traction outside, right? Josh mentioned we had some big corrections wins. We're seeing big international wins, especially with TASER 10. Some of our biggest deals have been outside that domestic LE business. And so, we really are seeing nice traction in some of the other parts of the markets we've been investing in.\nJosh Isner: Great. I might just add there as well, I think, state and local is a little different than federal, international and enterprise. Whereas, I think we've talked about this historically where for in state and local, what we really, really need to be good at is building new products and then upselling them into that market. And I think the team Draft One's a great example of that, and the team's doing a very nice job of that. In other markets, it's about taking products that we've already built and selling them in as kind of the first product into those new markets. And I think we're at varying levels of that across international, federal and enterprise, but it's still the same motion. And from there the adoption of one product leads to the next and the next and the next. So I think, it's two very different motions between state and local and the rest of our business, but the team's doing a really nice job of executing on those in parallel.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Meta. Up next, we have Keith Housum at Northcoast.\nKeith Housum: Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for the opportunity here. And I'll echo congratulations on the quarter. Guys, you had a lot of commentary on Draft One. Much appreciated. Perhaps, can you provide some similar color to Fusus? Now, it has been under your belt here for several months. I understand that's [successful for your guys] (ph), but hoping you can provide some equal color to Fusus that you guys did for Draft One.\nRick Smith: Yeah. Let me maybe take that first. You heard some of the commentary there about that we're pivoting our Dispatch strategy. And so, based on what we've learned, we brought two agencies live on Dispatch, and what we learned is the core Dispatch experience -- Dispatch systems have numerous elements in them. Two of the big ones to think about are they've got a command line console where they're -- basically, a 911 caller comes in, somebody picks up the phone, and then the call taker types it into a Dispatch system. Another person is reading those messages, that person is called a dispatcher, and then they relate it to a police officer in the field. Also in that CAD software is mapping software where the map tries to bring together different information. So, what we've learned is that agencies, they're frequently opening three, five, six different maps because you've got one for your vehicle locator -- you might have had Axon Respond or where your body cameras are, there's a RapidSOS, which is the guys who locate where the cell phone is, because most people are now calling on a cell phone. So, what we learned in the console software, very difficult to drive change. Dispatchers, it take six months to a year to train them how to do their job, learning the different dispatch codes. And so, what we learned is that that is not an area we could drive much innovation. In fact, each of the first two agencies we launched at said basically, we don't want anything new there. You've going to rebuild your software to fit our existing training, which is -- sometimes it's a hard decision, but Jeff and I sat and we talked about it. He said, this is not going to scale. If we have to rebuild -- and it's a fragmented business. There's many different CAD providers. Everybody does it a little different. But what we've learned from Fusus, the demand signal there has been extremely strong, and Fusus has been able to take over the map element, the geospatial display. So that's an area where in the time it we brought two agencies live on the Dispatch console software, we brought, I don't know, dozens or a hundred live in Fusus. So, we've been actually pivoting our CAD -- our whole CAD strategy is now pivoted to be very Fusus-centric. Like, okay, we think -- we know based on experience with customers, the existing map interfaces are not very good. Fusus is best in the world at this, and they can bring in the dispatch information into Fusus. They can bring in third-party cameras from the community. They can bring in our cameras. They're really the interstitial connections that bring everything together into one map interface. And so, we're really excited, and basically, our whole real-time communications has shifted to be very Fusus-centric. We've, in fact, already begun earlier this year shifting away from our own Respond map. We're bringing it to deprecate that in parts of our ecosystem and just replace it with the Fusus' experience. So, Jeff, is there anything else you'd want to add about Fusus that I might have missed?\nJeff Kunins: I think that's spot on. I mean, I think we're just hugely we are -- customers are as bullish on Fusus as we are, and I think they're just voting with their feet. And across the board, it is the fulcrum for the journey you've heard me talk about for a long time. Like, ultimately, the real-time operations journey is two things: win more sockets and win more moments. More sockets, meaning more sensors, more cameras on our panes of glass, and more moments, meaning more conversations, more collaboration, more minutes of that intense real time incident management stuff happening one way or another between our cameras, our sensors, and our pane of glass Now with Fusus, and they are the fulcrum of us being able to accelerate that journey.\nJosh Isner: One thing I might add there is just also that while we're super excited about the adoption and momentum within public safety, Fusus just represents this awesome opportunity in enterprise as well. And, I think that in terms of having a product that right now is so relevant for a lot of our enterprise customers and could be the first product they buy from Axon. And then, like, the motion we're talking about before, that opening the door to dams and body cams and additional solutions down the road. Fusus very much is proving to be that. And we're super excited about the kind of path that it's creating for us in the enterprise space as well.\nRick Smith: Yeah. Hey. Let me actually double down on that one. Sorry to keep going Keith, but you wanted some more detail. So, Fusus, initially thought of it is, oh, this helps a police department connect to third-party cameras like a school or a business. Yes. It does that. But we've been really interested to learn is there's many large enterprises. Some are private businesses. Some are big federal government agencies that have hundreds or thousands of their own facilities. And over the last decades, they've installed a bunch of different systems at all these different facilities, and they can't even manage their own cameras. But with Fusus, they don't have to come in and reinstall it all. They can basically use this same sort of network, appliance. They can plug it in, and so you could have a large agency, whether it's public or private, suddenly they don't have to go replace all their cameras. With Fusus, they can aggregate those feeds themselves and be able to share it to public safety partners. So, that's where I think the magic is coming in. We're having enterprises that are looking at Fusus for their own internal use in addition to being able to partner with agencies. And I think, Brittany, I don't know if you wanted to add anything in terms of the numbers on this.\nBrittany Bagley: I was going to throw some numbers in, but I think the enthusiasm covers it well. Keith, for us, Fusus is in our real-time operations group, as you heard the team talk about. And we did share that that grew over 100% in the quarter. So, it's continuing to perform really well and be one of the segments that's continue contributing to the growth in software outside of that evidence.com piece.\nKeith Housum: All right. I've got tons more [indiscernible]. I'm going to actually pass it off because I know...\nBrittany Bagley: I don't know, we can spend the whole rest of the call on this as you can tell.\nKeith Housum: I think so. That's why I'll pass it off. But thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nErik Lapinski: I appreciate it so that I can try to manage our time. We've got Jeremy Hamblin up next.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks. And apologies if we've already covered some of this, but I actually wanted to get into another piece of winning moments in -- get into the DFR space in Skydio and Dedrone. And just in terms of the ramp opportunity and kind of the timing as you progress through, this acquisition and moving forward with this particular space, I wanted to get a sense for the inbound kind of interest that you're seeing in this, the timing of when you feel like this could potentially add in at least somewhat of a material fashion to your business, and whether or not any of the events are creating more opportunities or more inbound interest in this particular category.\nRick Smith: Yeah. Let me start strategically, then maybe let some other folks get a little more detail. So, when you think about Dedrone, for our core business of law enforcement, their interest has been, I would say, sort of mediocre on the pure drone detection. It's like, yeah, that's interesting. It's not part of our day to day jobs today, but the DFR component, being able to fly a drone as a first responder, there's a ton of interest there. They see that as the natural extension of a drone program. And DFR last -- we ran the numbers. It was growing literally like a 10x rate, but in a 12 month period, we'd seen 10 times more agencies come on DFR. Now, we also think that counter drone defense is going to become a bigger deal. I mean, there's stories emerging now about the role of a drone in the assassination attempt on Trump. We think we're going to see, unfortunately, drones -- consumer-level drones can be weaponized pretty easily, especially based on the rapid innovation we're seeing in the Middle East and Ukraine. So, we also think there's going to be a big opportunity in law enforcement for counter drone, but it's not, no pun intended, on their radar so much yet. So, DFR was the big play there. But then, where Dedrone is also interesting for military customers, they've got a large number of systems deployed in Ukraine right now, and I think every country and every military is now getting very interested in how you deal with the threat of small FPV and consumer-grade drones. So Dedrone kinda gives us a new way to enter into the military markets, critical infrastructure from protecting all the NFL stadiums to nuclear power plants, etcetera. So, Dedrone gives us existing product lines to go into new markets and then hopefully pull the rest of our ecosystem along with it. Jeff, anything you'd add?\nJeff Kunins: No. I think that's all well said, but maybe if, Josh, you wanted to talk to the materiality question and sort of, like, you think about the pipeline over time...\nJosh Isner: Like, as Rick said, hey, this is going to take some time even though the numbers are kind of exponentially growing in terms of adoption. There is -- this is gonna take some time to be, you know, adopted in such a way that it has a material impact on our revenue. And so, I think for now, just like early days of the body camera business is in fleet business and so forth, it's about, hey, establishing relationships with the agencies. It's about getting the first kind of 1 or 2 drones in there and then landing and expanding over time. So, I would position this as strategically very important to win some market share early on, but more of a long-term effort, before it really starts to have a major impact on the P&L. And where do you guys assess the TAM in four or five years?\nJosh Isner: I think Rick said this before, and I certainly agree with it. I don't know if it's in the next 5 years, but in the next 10, we believe there'll be a one-to-one relationship between drones and police cars.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks, guys.\nJosh Isner: Thanks a lot, Jeremy. Appreciate it.\nErik Lapinski: We've got two left. We're going to go to Mike Ng at Goldman Sachs.\nMike Ng: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First on Axon cloud services, up really strong in the quarter, $19 million sequentially, which I think is the highest on record. Is that a good way to think about sequential growth from here? And when you think about cloud services and cloud revenue, like, do you think about it as a function of number of seats and revenue per seat, or do you have a different framework in terms of teasing out the longer-term opportunity there?\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah. I mean, great question. I'll start. It was a big step. You can probably see as you go back our steps jump around a bit for any number of reasons. And this happened to be a really nice quarter from a step standpoint. You also -- again, we talked a lot about Fusus, but you've got Fusus starting to come into those numbers and some good additions. So, I don't have particular go-forward guidance. And given this was the largest step, maybe take that into account as you think going forward. But really healthy growth, and we were happy to see it. And I'll let Jeff jump in on this one, too, probably as the owner of this segment, but yeah, we do, we think about revenue per seat, number of seats, and then a lot of the -- how many features and functions are each of these customers buying in terms of our add-on offerings.\nJeff Kunins: That's right. I think that's spot on. And so, it's another place where OSP factors in because it's a great -- as we've used that Amazon Prime analogy for a long time, it's a way for agencies when they have that procurement moment to buy a package that feels to them like a great deal even if they only have in mind a subset of the things in the package. And so, they're making a purchase decision that feels like a great deal even for a subset. And then, from that point forward, all the things that they aren't using yet feel free because they're already rolled into what they're already paying. And so, those procurement moments to get people on higher and higher tiers of OSP continues to be a pivotal part of our flywheel.\nMike Ng: Great. That's fantastic. And it's a good segue to the follow-up, which was just really trying to think about how much that like revenue per seat could actually grow? Like, I don't know if there's a good way to think about when you think about some of highest-value customers, like what's the revenue per seat for them versus some of the newer customers? How much more penetration in some of these newer software products like real-time operations and AI and productivity can there be into the existing installed base? I was struck by about half the growth coming from these newer software products. Thank you.\nBrittany Bagley: Yeah. No, it's a great question. I think probably the best we can give is we give periodic updates on how we're doing on our OSP penetration to give a sense for how much more room do we have to go. And we actually luckily shared an update this quarter that our OSP penetration went above the 20% mark. And so basically, that's of all OSP, not just premium, but it means that just over 20% of our potential customers are on our OSP plans. You can imagine with that, there's lots of room to go. That talks more to getting any customer at all onto our OSP plan, but then as you think about revenue per customer, that can be the most basic plan, and we move them up to our OSP premium plans over time. So, my punchline has lots of room to go on that one.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you, Brittany. Thank you, Jeff.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, Mike. And last but not least is Will Power at Baird.\nWill Power: All right. Great. Thank you. I guess I'll echo the congratulations. Broad-based, great to see. I guess I have two questions. Maybe first one for Josh. So, I was intrigued on TASER 10, your four largest deals outside the local law enforcement if I heard it right. Just it would be great to kind of understand what's happening there? And what's kind of driving that? And I guess within that, I'm also interested in kind of understanding how much is TASER 10 opening up new TASER customers altogether? Like, are you starting to see people that just didn't have TASER 7 or earlier versions go to TASER 10 because of the new capabilities?\nJosh Isner: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Will. Good to see you. It is exciting to see so much adoption and growth outside of state and local. I'd say there's -- the biggest dynamic in play there is in corrections even, but then more so in federal and in international, you just end up with these customers that are 2 times, 3 times, 4 times the size of NYPD. And so, the pension for large volume orders is so much larger outside of the state and local customer base. And that's what we're starting to see. We saw a large correction -- correctional facility purchase. We're also seeing a lot of international governments for the first time really ordering our devices in larger volumes, and same for the federal government and the federal civilian space. So, I think it's a function of just the work we've put in over the last five years to expand beyond state and local law enforcement. And now a lot of those -- a lot of that effort is starting to pay off, and I think it will pay off for years to come because there's still going to be plenty of upside in selling more and more TASER devices in. But like we said before, that's going to kind of open up the opportunity to sell body cameras in, to sell fleet in, sell drones, VR, et cetera. And so, I think this is promising in a lot of different ways to see TASER 10 so well adopted outside of the state and local customer base.\nWill Power: Okay. That's helpful. And I wanted to ask Rick one. As you know, there are fresh concerns on the macro economy, are we potentially going to go into some sort of recession. You have a great slide in the investor deck. I think in some respects, addresses this, right, looks at this consistency and public safety spend over a long period of time. But you've obviously been through a lot of cycles of the company. It'd just be great to kind of hear your perspective as to what type of impacts maybe you've seen in the past? And as you look forward, what we might expect in part because the portfolio has also changed quite a bit even at the customer base is somewhat similar?\nRick Smith: Are you calling me old, Will? Just completely [indiscernible].\nWill Power: No, you just got great perspective.\nRick Smith: I'm teasing, of course. Having a little fun with you. Always good to see you. Thanks for the question. I think the same dynamic we've seen in the past, we're in this kind of a bubble in some ways. And I mean, not like a frothy bubble, I mean just it's different. It's -- we haven't seen the economic swings really impact us one way or the other. When things are really great, it doesn't really lift us because of that. And when things are rough, we don't get hit downward with that. And I think it's because in our customer base, the -- whatever they're spending on tech, it's still a fraction of their overall spend. Almost all their money goes into personnel, vehicles and gas. And then, tech is relatively small. So, when times are really good, the agencies are typically hiring more people and expanding if the tax revenues are allowing it. In the tough times, I think in 2008, we had a quarter or two where they were really trying to like tighten their belt, but became clear, oh, yeah, we're going to have to actually make personnel cuts. We then found them investing more in productivity. And now back then, we are still primarily the TASER company, and body cameras were super new. I think what's different at this time, most of our revenues on these long-term contracts, we're an essential service, so we don't see agencies, better knock on wood when I say this, I can't fathom them like cutting back contracts. And in fact, things like Draft One, many agencies are still struggling to fill their approved budgeted seats. The post George Floyd sort of impact the difficulties around recruiting and kind of the negative energy around policing is improving. The pendulum is swinging, but many of them are still 15% to 20% below their targeted force numbers. And so that's where we're hearing the sort of magical feedback where they're like man, with Draft One, if it's freeing up 20%, 25% of my officer's day from writing reports, that's almost like a 20% bump in my force power overnight. So, I certainly hope we're not in the beginning of a big economic swoon. And I'm not going to tell you we're immune. I don't think anybody is immune, but historically, it just seems to be that we just -- we're in this different universe over here where those economics just don't seem to matter as much for good or for bad.\nJosh Isner: And I'd just add to that, Rick, that one of the really nice things that make us feel really good at Axon is our products save lives, and they also save money. And so for customers to move away from our products, it very literally is costing them money to do so and will make their economic situation worse, not better. And I think our customers understand and appreciate that. And certainly, we work really hard to make sure that our products deliver that type of value for our customers.\nWill Power: Okay. Thank you.\nErik Lapinski: Thanks, everyone.\nRick Smith: Thanks, Will.\nErik Lapinski: I'll toss it to Rick to close this out.\nRick Smith: All right. You got to knock on wood when you have results like this. And Josh, Jeff, Brittany and the team, just so many people work so hard and have delivered so consistently quarter in, quarter out. I was waiting for Erik to throw up the screen with the forward-looking statements when Josh was expressing his effusive enthusiasm for the back half of the year, but it's been just a phenomenal run with the team. But it really does feel like with Draft One and some of the other things we're doing, we're in the early innings in a lot of really exciting new stuff and new markets that are now really taking off as well. As Josh likes to tell me, there are so many different pathways to be able to make our numbers work. And just it's a really exciting time to be in the business. So, we're delighted to have been able to deliver these results. A little inside baseball. Brittany sort of joked that we didn't prove out to be very good at forecasting again this quarter, because the sales team overperformed where we thought we were going to be. Again, I tend to like those problems. Brittany would like to see us be a little more accurate. But we got to be...\nBrittany Bagley: But if we're not, this is the way to go.\nRick Smith: So of course, I challenged Josh, the sales, hey, let's keep overdelivering. Of course, we want to do that. So anyway, sorry for all the enthusiasm. We are having a good time. You got to enjoy the good quarters. And obviously, we're feeling good about the -- certainly the near term. And I'm super excited about the long term with all the stuff that's, frankly, unproven yet. That to me is the exciting stuff. A lot of good stuff that -- Draft One's off to a phenomenal start. And with that, I'm going to stop talking. Hey, Erik, are we doing anything at IACP with analysts this year? I should have asked that before I bring it up in front of everybody.\nErik Lapinski: We'll have something.\nRick Smith: Okay. So for those who can't stay tuned, IACP is going to be great in Boston this year. Check in with Erik on that. And we're just grateful to have you all supporting us with our shareholders. So thanks, and we'll see you on a couple of quarter -- oh, no, I'm sorry, in a couple of months for the next quarterly results.",

            "name": "Jeff Kunins",
            "content": "Sure. I think both you and Brittany said it well, but thanks, Jonathan, as always, for the question. I mean, I think the beauty of the strength is that it's universal across the diversity of all of our product lines and segments. Whether it is continued growth of core DEMS and more and more access to higher and higher tier plans of, like, unlimited third-party storage and all of those things, whether it's the core add-ons on the back of DEMS, redaction, all of those things, the strength and productivity, like the pipeline for Draft One, but records and standards and core transcription, and, of course, an RTO, the existing strength and respond, the addition of Fusus, and then, VR accelerating and everything across the board. So, I think that the thing that is the most interesting is how universal the growth is across the diversity of our product line. Yeah. Sure. I think hands down, like, we've talked about for multiple quarters, the role of drones and robotics broadly in public safety is another one of these rapidly accelerating rocket ships, and we intend to continue to play a bigger and bigger role in supporting agencies across all of the workloads for drones and robotics that they're doing. And, one of the most important aspects of that is this whole category of DFR, or drones as first responder. And within that, you need the right combination of many elements of the stack. You need the right drone hardware, you need the right piloting and all that stuff, you need the right mission management, you need the right docking infrastructure, and you need the right airspace protection. And so, as Rick just said, we were thrilled to announce this big comprehensive additional partnership together with Skydio, who's unquestionably the leading US hardware manufacturer. And, together with them and us and Dedrone and others, we're, confident that we are, by far, the best end-to-end solution for agencies in the US and steadily over the round of the world there. Plus, we continue to support together with Skydio and our other partners, all of the other workloads that aren't DFR yet in drones, and it's going to keep on growing. I think that's spot on. I mean, I think we're just hugely we are -- customers are as bullish on Fusus as we are, and I think they're just voting with their feet. And across the board, it is the fulcrum for the journey you've heard me talk about for a long time. Like, ultimately, the real-time operations journey is two things: win more sockets and win more moments. More sockets, meaning more sensors, more cameras on our panes of glass, and more moments, meaning more conversations, more collaboration, more minutes of that intense real time incident management stuff happening one way or another between our cameras, our sensors, and our pane of glass Now with Fusus, and they are the fulcrum of us being able to accelerate that journey. No. I think that's all well said, but maybe if, Josh, you wanted to talk to the materiality question and sort of, like, you think about the pipeline over time... That's right. I think that's spot on. And so, it's another place where OSP factors in because it's a great -- as we've used that Amazon Prime analogy for a long time, it's a way for agencies when they have that procurement moment to buy a package that feels to them like a great deal even if they only have in mind a subset of the things in the package.

            "name": "Rick Smith",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Erik, and thanks to all of you, our shareholders and analysts, for joining us today. Welcome to Axon's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am again proud to report another great quarter and to show you that video to highlight some of the incredible outcomes our team is delivering to our customers with Draft One. Our story is to build a world where we help our customers achieve better outcomes every day, and it still feels like we're just at the beginning. There are two things that I believe are critical to our success and ability to differentiate in the market. We move fast and we take risks. It is our speed and willingness to tackle the toughest problems that drives our innovation and allows us to recruit the best people. I think we're at the forefront in several technological areas that will define the next decade for our company. You've probably heard me talk about them before. First and possibly the most significant is artificial intelligence. We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications to our customers. We've been at this for many years and our progress is accelerating as the underlying technology and the interest to adopt reaches critical mass here in the US and around the world. One year ago, I shared with you our vision for generative AI applications as we saw commercially available LLMs, large language models, coming to the market. I told you we would be ready to catch the ball. Well, in April, we launched Draft One, a powerful new AI service that writes the first draft of a police report, extracted directly from Axon Body camera recordings. Our customers' response to Draft One is better than anything I've seen, better than we could have imagined. They want to put more data into the cloud with Axon, they want to better access that data, and they trust us to protect their data. And they can see that we can help them do their jobs better, put their data to use. Our unique position to define this category comes down to three key advantages that I believe we hold. One, the sensor network. We run the largest sensor ecosystem by far, including tasers, body cameras, in-car cameras, drones, robotics, and third-party cameras and sensors through Fusus. This vast network generates the data needed to drive the future of AI. Second is the data. Our expansive ecosystem of software and sensors has generated the industry's largest and most valuable data set. Now it's not our data, our customers own their data, and we protect it rigorously, and we provide them the tools they need to manage and leverage their data. We help them make their data accessible and usable, securely managing hundreds of petabytes of audio, video and imagery in the cloud. And third is trust. We work tirelessly. For decades we have to earn our customers' trust. We've led three major tech revolutions: TASER energy weapons, wearable cameras, and cloud software. And we have several more in progress, like virtual reality training, drone as first responder, and real-time sensor fusion. Our customers trust us as their thought partner, guiding them into the future, an AI-driven future. This trust is our most enduring advantage, built over decades, and we are dedicated maniacally to maintaining that trust by being reliable and trustworthy partners. AI is a hot topic right now. And there's concern about the commoditization of the underlying models. Some major tech companies are investing billions of dollars and then open sourcing their models, making some of the LLMs, these foundational models, free and potentially demonetizing the foundation model layer of the AI ecosystem. We believe we are uniquely positioned to leverage our position as the application and network layer to create significant value through time and cost savings that we deliver from the underlying technology through a world-class UI to our customers. By combining top-tier AI models with our sensor and software ecosystem, we can deliver exceptional workflows, all within a secured GovCloud environment. Our AI products not only offer tremendous growth opportunities for us, but also immense value to our customers. Solutions like Draft One, automated license plate reading, transcription, video redaction, these services quickly pay for themselves. I'm particularly excited about upcoming announcements that we have planned for the Annual Police Chiefs Conference, the IACP, in October. So, stay tuned. Our next focus is real-time operations, which we see as a major opportunity. From what we have learned in our work in legacy Dispatch systems, combined with our acquisition of Fusus, we believe we are positioned to redefine real-time communications and real-time operations for our customers. Our strength lies in innovation, not iteration. Therefore, we are shifting. We're pivoting from command-line dispatch console software to instead focus on sensor fusion and AI. This approach will integrate multiple data feeds, both human and technological, into a unified single pane of glass. Strategically, we're refocusing to align our unique innovation capability with the emerging technologies. Acquiring Fusus has given us a platform to accelerate our progress and we are doubling down on this investment. We plan to leverage the fully-integrated Fusus map experience to provide critical real-time information, enhancing decision making, and improving communications. We're excited to embrace this new vision and deliver exceptional results for our customers. Lastly, we remain highly enthusiastic about drones and robotic security. Last year, we acquired Sky-Hero in the tactical robotic space. Recently, we announced an expanded drone as first responder, or DFR, partnership ecosystem with Skydio, Dedrone, and DroneSense, each the leaders in their niche of the ecosystem. This collaboration offers the most advanced and comprehensive solution for drone as a first responder programs. We look forward to completing our acquisition of Dedrone later this year, further expanding our footprint in this dynamic space. I'm excited about what's ahead and see these updates as validation of our strategy. I believe we are uniquely positioned to achieve remarkable outcomes, driving immense value for our stakeholders across the board while solving real-world problems that matter. And with that, let me turn it over to the guy who leads the phenomenal execution you see quarter over quarter. Josh Isner, over to you. Yeah. Let me speak briefly. And then, Jeff, I might have you speak a little more in detail as well sort of the breakout of our current software. I tend to focus on the sort of the leading edge, and then as things kind of stabilize -- by the time they're bigger, I'm spending less of my time personally on them, and Jeff is really leading the large teams. Obviously, AI is a really interesting space right now. The -- what is -- what was impossible 18 months ago is now, frankly, easy in some cases. Things like Draft One is nearly magical in the user experience. The first time I turned it on was in, I think, February I got access to it in beta. I was at the Texas Department of Public Safety doing a demo -- actually, I probably shouldn't have given the exact name. Anyways, I was at a large agency in Texas doing a demo, and they were saying, \"oh, there's no way this will work\" with an East Texas accent. And they started teasing each other. And I said, \"Well, I don't know. Let's try it.\" And we had this officer come up, and, literally, this guy could have been on Saturday Night Live. He did the best, like, kind of hillbilly voice skit, was completely non-linear in answering questions, was all over the place. I was sure it was going to be a disaster, and I was just shocked at how well the AI turned all of the nonsense into a professional looking report in, like, literally 15 seconds. And we're seeing that reaction from customers across the board. We had some customers say that the time savings alone from Draft One justifies paying for the entire Officer Safety Plan. So, while it's not -- because of the nature of these things, the -- we write contracts upfront. It takes time for the revenue to kick in. I think Draft One is a real accelerator. It brings transcription. You need to have respond. You have to have the wireless connectivity for us to be able to push this up to the cloud, have it ready in time. So, it pulls other products with it, and then there's a whole suite of other stuff that we are now working on across the board. I would just tell you, Jeff and I sat down, and we said -- we kind of pulled the emergency brake and said across the entire business, every team is now researching what are the AI possibilities that justify changing our priorities so that we're nimble and that we're moving things that our customers couldn't even imagine are now moving to the top -- a year ago, are now at the top of our product development priorities. So with that, Jeff, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add. Hey, Josh. If I could jump in as well, something that's really different in the past three months is AI. I met with a senior -- a very senior government leader in continental Europe in a country where everything I had heard up until now was cloud [indiscernible], just showing Draft One. And look, we're able to film it and do it in French, no problem, because the underlying large language models from OpenAI, like they handle 100 languages without breaking a sweat. And I had this presidential advisor look at me and said, I've never -- like, I've understood the value of the cloud historically. It's been somewhat compelling, but, like, this is a game changer. And when you think about the complexity of deploying AI at scale and the massive GPU clusters you're going to need and the connectivity into the cloud just eases all that. So, we've been almost religious about our cloud fervor. In the US, our customers told us early on the cloud was illegal and that we -- they couldn't do it. Of course, we pressed through that, and now it's become ubiquitous. Europe's been harder. They've been very resistant to the cloud, and we've stuck to our guns, but it's taken a lot longer than we thought. I think this is still theory. We haven't seen a [indiscernible], but the early reactions are AI services like Draft One and some of the new stuff you'll see in a few months, could be enough to tip it over and start to make the cloud sweep through the rest of the world that's been very resistant to it. That'll be a real game changer, if that pans out. Yeah. So, I'll take that one and then see if Jeff needs to clean anything up. We've -- our strategy around drones has been to be very dynamic and flexible. DJI, up until now, has been the market leader, and through our partnership with DroneSense. Basically, DroneSense created piloting and data management software that would be able to use Chinese hardware with US software and data flows, so that it could be more secure, and that's been very successful. I'd say DroneSense is currently the market leader in terms of the number of drones flying on their software. The hardware bans have been instituted in some states already, like Florida, and Skydio is the clear US market leader. They're also the clear leader globally in autonomy, in terms of the drones being able to fly themselves without operator intervention. And so, Jeff really spearheaded the efforts around negotiating this new partnership, combining the best of DroneSense, Skydio, and Dedrone. So, we think we're well positioned either way this pans out. There was a movement towards a federal ban. It looks like that has, at least for now, been paused on DJI. So, we are prepared for either outcome, and we think we've got the best strategy we can that's optimized, and not betting on political outcomes because you can't bet on those. Jeff, anything you'd want to add? So, the monetization, as of right now, does not rely on any new products. So, in order for Draft One to work, you've got to have our body cameras. And then, with those body cameras, you need Respond+, which is the connectivity layer. You got to turn the service on so that we can wirelessly stream over secure LTE to get the audio up into the cloud, so that by the time you sit down in your patrol car where a lot of officers write their reports, the data is ready. Then, you need our transcription service so that we've transcribed that to feed it into the AI model that's going to write Draft One. And then, what we have seen is the -- so Draft One is opening -- basically causing agencies to open their contracts to add Draft One, and anytime that happens, now you're in a contract rewrite, and of course, that creates an opportunity. This is an interesting industry in that the effort expended just going through a procurement is almost more important than the amount of budgetary dollars. So, once they're in a procurement, I think there's a general customer sentiment of, okay, like, what else should we be looking at now, because if we're going to go through this, let's go through it, let's do our evaluation, and we find that opens their minds to doing more with us. And then, I think also they're aware of the speed at which this is happening, just the level of tech shift that's happening across society. And so we're, I think we're seeing them these OSP packages are a way to sort of derisk these acquisitions for our customers, where they don't necessarily even know how much of the stack they're going to use, kind of like if you sign up for Amazon Prime, like, you may or may not use the free videos, or you may or may not use the different things in there, but across we try to make it easy for them. It's like, \"hey, you don't have to figure it all out. There's a lot to understand here. If you go on the OSP plan, we'll figure it out together what's valuable for you.\" And I think Draft One is just kind of further accelerating that. Josh, is there anything you'd want to add to that? Yeah. Let me maybe take that first. You heard some of the commentary there about that we're pivoting our Dispatch strategy. And so, based on what we've learned, we brought two agencies live on Dispatch, and what we learned is the core Dispatch experience -- Dispatch systems have numerous elements in them. Two of the big ones to think about are they've got a command line console where they're -- basically, a 911 caller comes in, somebody picks up the phone, and then the call taker types it into a Dispatch system. Another person is reading those messages, that person is called a dispatcher, and then they relate it to a police officer in the field. Also in that CAD software is mapping software where the map tries to bring together different information. So, what we've learned is that agencies, they're frequently opening three, five, six different maps because you've got one for your vehicle locator -- you might have had Axon Respond or where your body cameras are, there's a RapidSOS, which is the guys who locate where the cell phone is, because most people are now calling on a cell phone. So, what we learned in the console software, very difficult to drive change. Dispatchers, it take six months to a year to train them how to do their job, learning the different dispatch codes. And so, what we learned is that that is not an area we could drive much innovation. In fact, each of the first two agencies we launched at said basically, we don't want anything new there. You've going to rebuild your software to fit our existing training, which is -- sometimes it's a hard decision, but Jeff and I sat and we talked about it. He said, this is not going to scale. If we have to rebuild -- and it's a fragmented business. There's many different CAD providers. Everybody does it a little different. But what we've learned from Fusus, the demand signal there has been extremely strong, and Fusus has been able to take over the map element, the geospatial display. So that's an area where in the time it we brought two agencies live on the Dispatch console software, we brought, I don't know, dozens or a hundred live in Fusus. So, we've been actually pivoting our CAD -- our whole CAD strategy is now pivoted to be very Fusus-centric. Like, okay, we think -- we know based on experience with customers, the existing map interfaces are not very good. Fusus is best in the world at this, and they can bring in the dispatch information into Fusus. They can bring in third-party cameras from the community. They can bring in our cameras. They're really the interstitial connections that bring everything together into one map interface. And so, we're really excited, and basically, our whole real-time communications has shifted to be very Fusus-centric. We've, in fact, already begun earlier this year shifting away from our own Respond map. We're bringing it to deprecate that in parts of our ecosystem and just replace it with the Fusus' experience. So, Jeff, is there anything else you'd want to add about Fusus that I might have missed? Yeah. Hey. Let me actually double down on that one. Sorry to keep going Keith, but you wanted some more detail. So, Fusus, initially thought of it is, oh, this helps a police department connect to third-party cameras like a school or a business. Yes. It does that. But we've been really interested to learn is there's many large enterprises. Some are private businesses. Some are big federal government agencies that have hundreds or thousands of their own facilities. And over the last decades, they've installed a bunch of different systems at all these different facilities, and they can't even manage their own cameras. But with Fusus, they don't have to come in and reinstall it all. They can basically use this same sort of network, appliance. They can plug it in, and so you could have a large agency, whether it's public or private, suddenly they don't have to go replace all their cameras. With Fusus, they can aggregate those feeds themselves and be able to share it to public safety partners. So, that's where I think the magic is coming in. We're having enterprises that are looking at Fusus for their own internal use in addition to being able to partner with agencies. And I think, Brittany, I don't know if you wanted to add anything in terms of the numbers on this. Yeah. Let me start strategically, then maybe let some other folks get a little more detail. So, when you think about Dedrone, for our core business of law enforcement, their interest has been, I would say, sort of mediocre on the pure drone detection. It's like, yeah, that's interesting. It's not part of our day to day jobs today, but the DFR component, being able to fly a drone as a first responder, there's a ton of interest there. They see that as the natural extension of a drone program. And DFR last -- we ran the numbers. It was growing literally like a 10x rate, but in a 12 month period, we'd seen 10 times more agencies come on DFR. Now, we also think that counter drone defense is going to become a bigger deal. I mean, there's stories emerging now about the role of a drone in the assassination attempt on Trump. We think we're going to see, unfortunately, drones -- consumer-level drones can be weaponized pretty easily, especially based on the rapid innovation we're seeing in the Middle East and Ukraine. So, we also think there's going to be a big opportunity in law enforcement for counter drone, but it's not, no pun intended, on their radar so much yet. So, DFR was the big play there. But then, where Dedrone is also interesting for military customers, they've got a large number of systems deployed in Ukraine right now, and I think every country and every military is now getting very interested in how you deal with the threat of small FPV and consumer-grade drones. So Dedrone kinda gives us a new way to enter into the military markets, critical infrastructure from protecting all the NFL stadiums to nuclear power plants, etcetera. So, Dedrone gives us existing product lines to go into new markets and then hopefully pull the rest of our ecosystem along with it. Jeff, anything you'd add? Are you calling me old, Will? Just completely [indiscernible]. I'm teasing, of course. Having a little fun with you. Always good to see you. Thanks for the question. I think the same dynamic we've seen in the past, we're in this kind of a bubble in some ways. And I mean, not like a frothy bubble, I mean just it's different. It's -- we haven't seen the economic swings really impact us one way or the other. When things are really great, it doesn't really lift us because of that. And when things are rough, we don't get hit downward with that. And I think it's because in our customer base, the -- whatever they're spending on tech, it's still a fraction of their overall spend. Almost all their money goes into personnel, vehicles and gas. And then, tech is relatively small. So, when times are really good, the agencies are typically hiring more people and expanding if the tax revenues are allowing it. In the tough times, I think in 2008, we had a quarter or two where they were really trying to like tighten their belt, but became clear, oh, yeah, we're going to have to actually make personnel cuts. We then found them investing more in productivity. And now back then, we are still primarily the TASER company, and body cameras were super new. I think what's different at this time, most of our revenues on these long-term contracts, we're an essential service, so we don't see agencies, better knock on wood when I say this, I can't fathom them like cutting back contracts. And in fact, things like Draft One, many agencies are still struggling to fill their approved budgeted seats. The post George Floyd sort of impact the difficulties around recruiting and kind of the negative energy around policing is improving. The pendulum is swinging, but many of them are still 15% to 20% below their targeted force numbers. And so that's where we're hearing the sort of magical feedback where they're like man, with Draft One, if it's freeing up 20%, 25% of my officer's day from writing reports, that's almost like a 20% bump in my force power overnight. So, I certainly hope we're not in the beginning of a big economic swoon. And I'm not going to tell you we're immune. I don't think anybody is immune, but historically, it just seems to be that we just -- we're in this different universe over here where those economics just don't seem to matter as much for good or for bad. Thanks, Will. All right. You got to knock on wood when you have results like this. And Josh, Jeff, Brittany and the team, just so many people work so hard and have delivered so consistently quarter in, quarter out. I was waiting for Erik to throw up the screen with the forward-looking statements when Josh was expressing his effusive enthusiasm for the back half of the year, but it's been just a phenomenal run with the team. But it really does feel like with Draft One and some of the other things we're doing, we're in the early innings in a lot of really exciting new stuff and new markets that are now really taking off as well. As Josh likes to tell me, there are so many different pathways to be able to make our numbers work. And just it's a really exciting time to be in the business. So, we're delighted to have been able to deliver these results. A little inside baseball. Brittany sort of joked that we didn't prove out to be very good at forecasting again this quarter, because the sales team overperformed where we thought we were going to be. Again, I tend to like those problems. Brittany would like to see us be a little more accurate. But we got to be... So of course, I challenged Josh, the sales, hey, let's keep overdelivering. Of course, we want to do that. So anyway, sorry for all the enthusiasm. We are having a good time. You got to enjoy the good quarters. And obviously, we're feeling good about the -- certainly the near term. And I'm super excited about the long term with all the stuff that's, frankly, unproven yet. That to me is the exciting stuff. A lot of good stuff that -- Draft One's off to a phenomenal start. And with that, I'm going to stop talking. Hey, Erik, are we doing anything at IACP with analysts this year? I should have asked that before I bring it up in front of everybody. Okay. So for those who can't stay tuned, IACP is going to be great in Boston this year. Check in with Erik on that. And we're just grateful to have you all supporting us with our shareholders. So thanks, and we'll see you on a couple of quarter -- oh, no, I'm sorry, in a couple of months for the next quarterly results."

            "name": "Brittany Bagley",
            "content": "Thank you, Josh. As both Rick and Josh highlighted, we had a great quarter. We grew revenue 35% year-over-year on top of 31% growth in the same quarter last year, and we delivered strong adjusted EBITDA. I am particularly impressed that the growth comes from all our business segments, driven by our powerful ecosystem. Our customer-centric approach solves real problems, which drives us to innovate, and you can see those results in the business. Cloud and Services remains the fastest-growing segment at 47% year-over-year. Our software growth stands out and has continued to drive mix shift with 39% of revenue coming from software and services in Q2, up from 35% last year and 29% the year before. TASER 10 and Axon Body 4 also contributed an impressive 28% year-over-year growth in both our TASER and sensors product categories. These products are performing incredibly well and we're still in the early innings. Overall, our future contracted revenue sits at approximately $7.4 billion, which is up 41% year-over-year, and ARR of $850 million is up 44% year-over-year, while maintaining 122% net revenue retention. Along with continuing strength in Axon Evidence, the new products we talk about are helping drive our consistently high NRR. Adjusted gross margin of 62.5% increased by 10 basis points year-over-year. This was supported by mix in our software business, as well as the benefits of automation in our TASER business. We cleaned up some of our older inventory on the sensor side, given the better-than-expected demand for AB4, which was a partial offset to our strong gross margin in the quarter. At this point though, we expect to see stable gross margins for these segments going forward and expect overall gross margin around this level for the remainder of the year. Below the gross margin line, we continue to focus on scaling the business, both to drive profitability and to successfully deliver on our top-line growth. This has included adding a new manufacturing facility to increase production capacity for TASER devices and cartridges, as well as integrating our acquisitions and investing in R&D. We've been able to invest in and grow the business while driving operating efficiency. Increased revenue, gross margin, and operating efficiency drove adjusted EBITDA to $123 million, which was 24.5% margin in the quarter, up 270 basis points year-over-year, and surpassing our highest level in over three years. We also had free cash flow conversion above 60% in the quarter, leading to $75 million of adjusted free cash flow. Turning to our outlook, we are pleased to raise guidance again on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Our full year 2024 expected revenue guidance is increasing to $2 billion to $2.05 billion, which represents 29.5% annual growth at the midpoint. This is up from our prior guidance of $1.94 billion to $1.99 billion, which represented approximately 26% annual growth at the midpoint. And it's a result of the strong performance we saw in Q2 and the strong pipeline in the second half of the year. We expect full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $460 million to $475 million, implying an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.1% at the midpoint. This is up from our prior adjusted guidance of $430 million to $445 million and it expands our expected margin by 80 basis points. The increase in our adjusted EBITDA guidance includes better-than-expected performance in Q2 and our increased expectations for the remainder of the year. Consistent with last quarter, our guidance incorporates an immaterial amount of revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin impact from our planned acquisition of Dedrone, which we still expect to close in the current year. Overall, we saw strength across the board on the P&L, shipped a record number of tasers and body cameras, generated strong cash flow, made additional investments into our drone partnerships and remain on track to close Dedrone, and strengthened our bookings pipeline for the back half of the year to record numbers. I'd say we're quite proud of this quarter, and I want to give a huge thank you to the incredible team we have for making it all happen. And with that, I would like to open it up to questions. I can start and then maybe turn it over to Rick who I know is incredibly excited about this. But we made the call out this quarter that we're both seeing terrific continued growth from our evidence.com product, but we're also seeing increasing contributions to the growth from our other suite of software products, and that's really across the board in those other categories. So, calling out productivity and AI and all of those pieces. We did call out the Draft One. While we're incredibly excited about the pipeline with over $100 million in pipeline, it's not actually yet contributing to the revenue in the quarter. So, continues to be a big area of excitement going forward, but the tremendous increase you're seeing this quarter is really coming from the existing products that we've talked about. Yeah. You got it. It's just timing. It depends on when the new revenue starts turning on in the quarter. And bookings in Q1 were relatively light as we go through the year, and so you just see that rolling into ARR in this quarter. So, I wouldn't read any more into it than that. We're still really happy with the 40%-plus year-over-year growth in that ARR number, and that's what we're looking at. Yeah. I was happy to say, I think, our margins generally are starting to stabilize around the levels you're seeing them at now, and so that's both inside of our segments and for our overall gross margin. So, hopefully, some of the noise that we've been seeing in past quarters is stabilizing a bit. And I would say some of that benefit you're seeing in the TASER gross margin this quarter is, we've talked about automation coming online, and you're starting to see the benefits of that. So, I think you'll see that benefit going forward. And then, just as we go through the year, mix does always tend to move things up or down a little bit, both inside the segments and for the overall gross margins. Meta, the one thing I'd add to that is you asked about new product announcements. I would just say, like, you can imagine given the enthusiasm that Rick and Jeff and the teams are actively working on new products also. And so, like, yes, stay tuned for new areas that we develop and we go into in this in the future. Yeah. I mean, I think that our domestic law enforcement business continues to just put up really incredible numbers and just deliver. And you see that from all of the things that the team has been talking about in terms of the ability to upgrade, to move on to OSP to continue making those migrations, but we are seeing great traction outside, right? Josh mentioned we had some big corrections wins. We're seeing big international wins, especially with TASER 10. Some of our biggest deals have been outside that domestic LE business. And so, we really are seeing nice traction in some of the other parts of the markets we've been investing in. I was going to throw some numbers in, but I think the enthusiasm covers it well. Keith, for us, Fusus is in our real-time operations group, as you heard the team talk about. And we did share that that grew over 100% in the quarter. So, it's continuing to perform really well and be one of the segments that's continue contributing to the growth in software outside of that evidence.com piece. I don't know, we can spend the whole rest of the call on this as you can tell. Yeah. I mean, great question. I'll start. It was a big step. You can probably see as you go back our steps jump around a bit for any number of reasons. And this happened to be a really nice quarter from a step standpoint. You also -- again, we talked a lot about Fusus, but you've got Fusus starting to come into those numbers and some good additions. So, I don't have particular go-forward guidance. And given this was the largest step, maybe take that into account as you think going forward. But really healthy growth, and we were happy to see it. And I'll let Jeff jump in on this one, too, probably as the owner of this segment, but yeah, we do, we think about revenue per seat, number of seats, and then a lot of the -- how many features and functions are each of these customers buying in terms of our add-on offerings. Yeah. No, it's a great question. I think probably the best we can give is we give periodic updates on how we're doing on our OSP penetration to give a sense for how much more room do we have to go. And we actually luckily shared an update this quarter that our OSP penetration went above the 20% mark. And so basically, that's of all OSP, not just premium, but it means that just over 20% of our potential customers are on our OSP plans. You can imagine with that, there's lots of room to go. That talks more to getting any customer at all onto our OSP plan, but then as you think about revenue per customer, that can be the most basic plan, and we move them up to our OSP premium plans over time. So, my punchline has lots of room to go on that one. But if we're not, this is the way to go."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Josh Isner",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Rick, and good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to start today's remarks on a personal note. In June, I celebrated my 15th year work anniversary at Axon. In 2009, Axon, the name TASER, was much smaller carrying a market cap of $245 million. It is a testament to Rick's vision and leadership that Axon is in a much different place today both in terms of size and impact. I feel very lucky to have been part of this awesome team for so long, and I'm thrilled to witness the tremendous results driven by such a talented and mission-oriented group of individuals. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered again in Q2, and we feel great about the momentum we are seeing in the second half and beyond. While Rick continues to focus on our vision and make sure that we're headed in the right direction, I continue to focus my time on our execution and ensuring we have the right team to help us achieve that vision over the long term. I have a few updates from the quarter that I am particularly excited to share. First, we achieved record second quarter revenue and bookings. It was our first quarter with over $500 million in revenue, a number that represented our full year revenue just a few years ago. We booked over $1 billion in new business, closed our largest-ever contract with the US state and local customer, closed our largest-ever corrections deal, and we are seeing an uptake in our -- an uptick in our international momentum. Our international bookings are up 100% year-to-date versus last year. And just a couple weeks ago, we signed our largest records contract ever with that segment. Next, I'll briefly share some detail on where we are seeing accelerating demand for our products. Our new introductions over the past year have ignited. TASER 10 is the fastest selling TASER device in our history. Not only is demand pacing at over 2x the rate of TASER 7 on the order side, but we've able -- we've been able to scale shipments each quarter since launch. We've eclipsed more than 100,000 units shipped, and we have a long runway ahead. Something I find particularly encouraging here is that our top four TASER 10 deals have come from customers outside of our US state and local customer base. We have a massive TASER user base within state and local, but we also see strong demand from our customers, in other segments like federal, international, and from corrections customers as well. The order book for TASER 10 is strong across the board. In Q2, we shipped the most body cameras we've ever shipped in a single quarter. Along with TASER 10, Axon Body 4, and our expanding set of premium software, adoption of our Officer Safety Plan is growing as seven of our top 10 domestic deals in the quarter included premium Officer Safety Plan options. Finally, we are seeing the early indicators of success supporting our investments in newer areas within our software business from revenue -- I'm sorry, revenue from productivity, AI products, real-time operations, and drones and robotics drove almost half of the growth in our software revenue in Q2. Early traction within Draft One is a great example. In the three months since launch, Draft One has generated over $100 million of pipeline, the fastest of any Axon software product to do so. We believe demand for products like Draft One will only grow from here. Halfway through the year, we are pleased to be well-positioned to deliver another year of growth and sustained impact. However, we're on to the next play and nobody is letting up. We have a fantastic opportunity to deliver a similar bookings number over the next six months that we achieved in the entire 2023 campaign. The team is relentlessly focused on executing, and we're excited to show what we can do in the second half. Over to you, Brittany. Sure thing. Thanks for the question, Trevor. Well, I'd say it's really the convergence of a couple things that we've been working on for a couple years now. Number one is getting the team right. I think, this is the strongest international team we've had. We've made some new additions to the team in 2024, not only with Cameron Brooks, our CRO, but with some of -- some new leadership in Europe, some new country managers. And I think that's already showing a different level of rigor and intensity than we've had kind of across the board historically. So, very excited about that. I think number two, TASER 10 is really us -- allowing us to start and restart conversations around TASER adoption. And it's driving a lot of interest in a lot of the core markets. I think the market is more -- moving more in the direction of cloud now, especially certain markets internationally. And I think we've been opportunistic there and continue to grow the pipeline. And so, I think those are really the three big things. The last one that is kind of a continual effort is making sure we're focused on the right places. I think at times, historically, we've gone a little off kilter with the volume of opportunities and that's affected our execution. And I think at this point in time, we are really locked in on the places we have strong conviction we can be successful and we're investing in those areas and the team is doing a great job in executing in those geographies. And so, I think all those factors are really contributing to the great results we're seeing internationally. I would say, like, we're still on -- very much in our own territory here, looking down the whole field. We've got a ton of opportunity here. And this is going to be essentially the low point of our international results this year and a ton of opportunity to build on into the future here, especially with the right team in place now. So, very excited about what the future holds for international. Sure thing. Thanks for the question. Ultimately, the pipeline is very strong. Of course, that's something we track as a company and as a sales team. And it all comes down to just the conviction that we have and how accurate it is. And look, like, we have the best sales team in this industry. The sales team is one of our strongest teams in the company, and I would bet on them all day. And so, I think we are going to have a massive back half in terms of bookings. We see the pipeline everywhere across the business, but more importantly, the names next to the pipeline are names that I have a ton of conviction and belief in, and I think everyone's going to be really pleased to see what the team is -- puts up in Q3 and Q4 here. No. I think the beauty -- like Rick just described, is the fact that adopting one product often opens up increased value for the next product to come in and solve an additional problem. So the bridge from respond to transcription to Draft One, and I think we will see that in other parts of the business. Rick mentioned real-time operations and participating in that market to a larger extent. I think there's similar opportunities there between Respond and other AI offerings to drive additional value and solve additional problems. So, I think it really nicely fits together when one solution leads to the next. Great. I might just add there as well, I think, state and local is a little different than federal, international and enterprise. Whereas, I think we've talked about this historically where for in state and local, what we really, really need to be good at is building new products and then upselling them into that market. And I think the team Draft One's a great example of that, and the team's doing a very nice job of that. In other markets, it's about taking products that we've already built and selling them in as kind of the first product into those new markets. And I think we're at varying levels of that across international, federal and enterprise, but it's still the same motion. And from there the adoption of one product leads to the next and the next and the next. So I think, it's two very different motions between state and local and the rest of our business, but the team's doing a really nice job of executing on those in parallel. One thing I might add there is just also that while we're super excited about the adoption and momentum within public safety, Fusus just represents this awesome opportunity in enterprise as well. And, I think that in terms of having a product that right now is so relevant for a lot of our enterprise customers and could be the first product they buy from Axon. And then, like, the motion we're talking about before, that opening the door to dams and body cams and additional solutions down the road. Fusus very much is proving to be that. And we're super excited about the kind of path that it's creating for us in the enterprise space as well. Like, as Rick said, hey, this is going to take some time even though the numbers are kind of exponentially growing in terms of adoption. There is -- this is gonna take some time to be, you know, adopted in such a way that it has a material impact on our revenue. And so, I think for now, just like early days of the body camera business is in fleet business and so forth, it's about, hey, establishing relationships with the agencies. It's about getting the first kind of 1 or 2 drones in there and then landing and expanding over time. So, I would position this as strategically very important to win some market share early on, but more of a long-term effort, before it really starts to have a major impact on the P&L. And where do you guys assess the TAM in four or five years? I think Rick said this before, and I certainly agree with it. I don't know if it's in the next 5 years, but in the next 10, we believe there'll be a one-to-one relationship between drones and police cars. Thanks a lot, Jeremy. Appreciate it. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Will. Good to see you. It is exciting to see so much adoption and growth outside of state and local. I'd say there's -- the biggest dynamic in play there is in corrections even, but then more so in federal and in international, you just end up with these customers that are 2 times, 3 times, 4 times the size of NYPD. And so, the pension for large volume orders is so much larger outside of the state and local customer base. And that's what we're starting to see. We saw a large correction -- correctional facility purchase. We're also seeing a lot of international governments for the first time really ordering our devices in larger volumes, and same for the federal government and the federal civilian space. So, I think it's a function of just the work we've put in over the last five years to expand beyond state and local law enforcement. And now a lot of those -- a lot of that effort is starting to pay off, and I think it will pay off for years to come because there's still going to be plenty of upside in selling more and more TASER devices in. But like we said before, that's going to kind of open up the opportunity to sell body cameras in, to sell fleet in, sell drones, VR, et cetera. And so, I think this is promising in a lot of different ways to see TASER 10 so well adopted outside of the state and local customer base. And I'd just add to that, Rick, that one of the really nice things that make us feel really good at Axon is our products save lives, and they also save money. And so for customers to move away from our products, it very literally is costing them money to do so and will make their economic situation worse, not better. And I think our customers understand and appreciate that. And certainly, we work really hard to make sure that our products deliver that type of value for our customers."

I hope you all had a chance to read our shareholder letter, which was released after the market closed. You can find at investor.axon.com.\n Our prepared remarks today are meant to build upon the information and financial tables in that letter. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made today are pursuant to and within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today and are not guarantees of future performance.

A description of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found in our shareholder letter as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website.\n Now turning to our quarterly update. We like to start off every quarter with a video because we think it's a great way to show you more about our business, and there's no shortage of pilots to share from our teams. We've got a good one this quarter. It's about 5 minutes. Let's pull it up.\n [Presentation] \nPatrick Smith: Thank you, Eric, and thank you all for joining us here today. I want to welcome you all to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. We have kicked off what is shaping up to be another incredible year at Axon. You saw me talk about my vision in the video we just showed you, and I'm energized by the updates we're bringing you today.\n First, one of the areas I'm obviously very excited about is drones, robotics and aerospace security. I believe drone as a first responder or DFR, is a massive opportunity ahead of us. We anticipate that it will drive faster response times and improve decision-making, giving us extra seconds and more information before we act in critical situations.\n As we push forward into this new era of aerial innovation, drones are not just helpful tools, they're becoming indispensable. At the same time, drone tracking and countermeasures become equally, if not even more important, and we believe a critical element to enable widespread drone is the first responder programs.\n DFR programs are designed to deploy drones to an emergency in advance of human first responders, enhancing situational awareness to improve response strategies, optimizing the allocation of already limited resources and reducing the risk of harm to first responders and communities.\n But limitations exist that to date have hindered the use of DFR at scale, namely current FAA requirements mandate the presence of a human virtual observer standing on a rooftop to ensure each drone remains in a direct line of sight. That means operators must be positioned in relatively close proximity to the scene, usually on rooftops and operating primarily in clear daytime conditions. That's one of the reasons I am so thrilled about our planned and announced acquisition of Dedrone. We believe Dedrone's technology solves through these limitations, allowing law enforcement to operate in low visibility conditions and the times of day without the need to maintain a human observer with a line of sight.\n The planned combination of Dedrone with Axon is a natural extension of our strategy with several tangential applications already deployed in the field, including stadium, aerospace security, along with robust military critical infrastructure and other civilian protection applications.\n Another area I'm very passionate about is the realm of artificial intelligence. I believe that we will one day look back on these times is the beginning of the AI era. AI has applications across every element of what we do and offers the potential to unlock our human capital resources to accomplish more than we've ever been able to in the past.\n In the video we showed, you briefly saw us introduce our most recent innovation here, born from our visionary initiative 7 years ago, Draft One leverages AI to produce police reports from body camera, audio and video.\n Our studies have found that officers in the U.S. spend about 40% of their time or 15 hours per week on what is essentially data entry, writing reports. This is valuable time they could be spending in their communities, with their families, in training or on their own well-being. With Draft One, we're giving them a new lifeline that we expect will save them critical hours each and every day.\n And while these two developments are massive in their potential, there are just two examples of where we're focusing our innovation and we are not slowing down and several other areas that we believe will also be critical to achieving our moonshot goal.\n We've introduced real-time operation solutions that bring situational awareness into the modern age, expanding our ecosystem to ingest networks of cameras and sensors, infuses and raising the bar for communications beyond monolithic audio to include live streaming, video and two-way voice communications through video and audio feeds.\n We introduced our new mobile application, which allows our customers to seamlessly work together on evidence management and report writing while they're on the go. And we're giving agencies new capabilities and next-level training to improve human performance under pressure in the most high stakes events with our continuously improving and expanding VR portfolio. As I reflect on what we've delivered to the market and where we're investing, I think we are still in the early chapters of an epic story.\n And before I pass it over, I want to take a minute to acknowledge that our mission is more important than ever. We've seen a number of truly unfortunate and devastating tragedies between the police and the public over just the last few months. Our thoughts are with the families and departments who are experiencing these difficult times that we are out to end. We're innovating for a better future and remain dedicated to our mission to protect life.\n And with that, I'll turn it over to Josh. \nJoshua Isner: Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon to everybody. I'm humbled to share more about another excellent quarter at Axon.\n While we continue to build out the operating system of public safety, the team has not lost focus on the importance of execution. There's no doubt in my mind, we have the best and most well-equipped team in our industry, and our first quarter results are further proof of that.\n I feel really good about our momentum to start 2024. We started the year running at full speed as the team closed out 2023 with our strongest bookings quarter in company history. In Q1, we worked hard to set the stage for the remainder of the year.\n Since it is the only quarter in which very few budgets close, we focus on pipeline development and key customer-facing hiring initiatives. I am happy to report that our pipeline is the strongest and is the healthiest it has ever been across all major customer segments. This is a testament to our awesome R&D teams that continue to zero in on strong product market fit across our entire portfolio, driving this type of record demand.\n Weather, it's TASER 10, now being more directly linked to VR training within our TASER platform, or our on-body cameras, changing the game for real-time operations or Draft One revolutionizing the RMS category there's so much for us to bring to the market, and we are just at the beginning of what we think will be a deep increase in the ways we leverage technology and public safety for the better over the next decade.\n Looking ahead, I see many opportunities for continued growth. We believe our domestic state and local law enforcement customers are eager to adopt the new products that we have brought to the market and we are seeing our emerging markets become more meaningful contributors to our results.\n One of the many things that gets me excited about Dedrone is their strong international presence, which could accelerate our international channel expansion. On that note, I'd like to share our excitement in welcoming Cameron Brooks as our new Chief Revenue Officer. Cameron came to us from Amazon Web Services, where he most recently led their Europe, Middle East and Africa business for the public sector. As we look to drive more cloud adoption across the world, Cameron's wealth of experience and spurring international cloud adoption will be a powerful asset to our team. Cameron joining Axon is a perfect example of how our mission and our unique approach to the market helps us attract the best talent from some of the most successful companies in tech.\n Before I pass it over to Brittany, I want to briefly highlight how grateful I am for my teammates at Axon. We have spent the last 2 years fortifying and rebuilding our leadership team, and we are ready to move faster than ever. We are focused on the right areas to continue delivering in the quarters and years to come, both on our financial commitments and on our mission. We just recorded our ninth consecutive quarter of greater than 25% revenue growth, and our business has approximately quadrupled over the last 5 years. We're also delivering our strongest adjusted EBITDA margins in more than 3 years as promised.\n This kind of compounding does not happen without the best people and the best products and without a lot of things going right behind the scenes. While it's always encouraging to deliver such strong results, we continue to embrace our next play mindset and put our collective organizational energy behind the most important metric of all, and that is lives saved.\n And with that, I'll pass it over to you, Brittany. \nBrittany Bagley: Thank you, Josh. We're very proud of the results again this quarter for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We had 34% top line growth on top of 34% growth in Q1 last year, supported by our cloud and services revenue, which grew 51.5% year-over-year. This came from growth in both users and premium product add-ons driving upsell.\n Demand for TASER 10 also remained robust and drove 33% growth year-over-year in our TASER segment, supported by increasing supply availability. Sensors and other revenue grew 14% year-over-year with the adoption of Axon Body 4 driving camera revenue, somewhat offset by lapping the big catch-up in fleet revenue from Q1 last year as we're now at more normalized deployment levels.\n In addition to healthy growth across all our categories, we see strength across our end markets. In Q1, over 25% of our revenue came from outside domestic law enforcement, including international, federal, other adjacent markets like corrections in Justice and Enterprise. Our ARR for the quarter is $825 million, up almost 50% year-over-year, and it now includes Fusus and our TASER warranty revenue. We continue to maintain a net revenue retention of 122%.\n In Q1, we introduced adjusted gross margin to normalize for increased stock-based compensation resulting from the grants we made to employees whose compensation was under a specified threshold, many of whom are in manufacturing. As a reminder, we've committed to keeping our stock-based compensation at or below an average annual dilution of 3% for 2025 and beyond, and this is in keeping with that commitment.\n Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 63.2%, up from 61.5% in Q4. This improvement was from product mix benefit as well as the fact we didn't have any onetime reserves hit this quarter. We do expect some pressure on gross margin for the rest of the year as we continue to balance mix shift and ramping T10 capacity.\n Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin increased year-over-year from 19% to 23.6%, representing a 460 basis point improvement. In addition to the benefit of strong gross margins, we saw operating leverage contribute approximately 110 basis points year-over-year. As Josh mentioned, this is our strongest adjusted EBITDA margin quarter in 3 years since COVID.\n We continue to balance driving strong top line growth with investing in the business. We're pleased to be able to do this both organically and inorganically and are thrilled about our plans to welcome the Dedrone team to Axon. Rick did a great job talking through the strategic rationale.\n From a financial standpoint, we expect to close the deal sometime over the summer and to have approximately one full quarter of financials included in our 2024 results. This timing is subject to customary closing conditions. We expect that the potential acquisition of Dedrone would increase our TAM by $14 billion, bringing our overall addressable market to $77 billion. Dedrone is still investing for growth, and we expect incremental costs from their business and from integration that would have a slight impact to our core adjusted EBITDA margin. We've tried to factor this into our updated guidance and should be able to further refine these assumptions next quarter.\n Today, Dedrone is small relative to our overall business, and once closed, you will see them incorporated into our Software and Sensors segment. Dedrone highlights another step in our M&A strategy of acquiring talent and technology that complements our road map and expands our addressable market. In total, our acquisitions of Sky-Hero and Fusus and our planned acquisition of Dedrone have expanded our TAM by more than 50% over the last year from $50 billion to $77 billion. The acquisitions also increased our capabilities in robotic security and real-time operations, both areas we view as critical to the future of policing and our other markets, and we are excited to continue delivering on our product vision.\n Finally, I'll turn to our guidance. We are increasing our full year 2024 expected revenue guidance to $1.94 billion to $1.99 billion, which represents approximately 26% annual growth at the midpoint, above the prior high end of our guidance range of 20% to 24%. This incorporates both our outperformance in Q1 and our increased expectations for the year.\n While future contracted revenue was down slightly quarter-over-quarter to $7 billion in Q1, we have a strong pipeline for the year to underpin our forecast. We have also included an immaterial amount of revenue we expect to come from Dedrone this year, reflecting everything we currently know.\n We expect adjusted EBITDA of $430 million to $445 million, which implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22% up year-over-year and approximately in line with our prior guidance on margin. This includes our best estimate of integration costs and impact from M&A on the year.\n Finally, we've also increased our expected investment in CapEx to $80 million to $95 million for the year as we are continuing to ramp our capacity investments to meet the strong demand for TASER 10. We're very pleased with these results and think the quarter demonstrates continued execution on our business across both the top and bottom line as well as strong investments for the future so we can continue to deliver outsized performance.\n And with that, I would like to open it up to questions. \nUnknown Executive: Thanks, Brittany. I think we're all up in [ gallery ] with you. We'll take our first question from Meta Marshall at Morgan Stanley. \nMeta Marshall: Congrats on the quarter, guys. I wanted to dig into Draft One and just get a sense of how long you foresee kind of departments needing for approval processes and whether you kind of see that once a couple of major departments sign-offs that the approval processes can go much quicker. And then maybe just a second question for Brittany that I'll include this upfront. Just the contribution of Fusus to the year? Or just what you're kind of accounting for between Fusus and Dedrone for kind of the inorganic contribution to the year? \nJoshua Isner: Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Rick, did you want to lead us off? I saw you speaking there. \nPatrick Smith: Yes, I had myself on mute there. Yes, I would start by telling you, we've introduced a lot of exciting products over the years. This is probably the most enthusiasm I've seen for any product we've ever introduced. I mean, police officers did not get in this career to be writing reports, and we've done a lot of background work with our Epics and Equity Advisory Council as well as district attorneys and others looking at what the risks are and testing against those. We do make sure that we're putting speed bumps in there. So obvious that we are reviewing the final report. It's really important that it's theirs.\n But what we're seeing is pretty rapidly they're realizing the agencies and their partners, again, district attorneys and others are telling us the reports they're getting when officers are using Draft One are better than the reports that they're writing on their own. And so while it's pretty early for us to make any exact predictions, the overall friction to adoption is low. This doesn't require a lot of professional services and integration. It's pretty easy for us to turn it on. It's very simple for officers to figure out how to use. And we're finding, again, as soon as they get experience with it, their feedback is pretty fantastic. \nJoshua Isner: Yes. Just add to that, ultimately, there will be a sales cycle associated with it, just like anything in selling the government, but I think we're already seeing some early orders come in and the pipeline is building. We think in the second half of this year and especially going into next year, we'll see this start to really contribute to in-quarter revenue and ultimately at a high margin as well.\n So we're very excited of about what this will entail for our results, but most excited about the fact that in a climate where it's very hard to add police officers to police forces, that we have the propensity to put police officers back on the street instead of behind the computer here without having to make any incremental hires from the outside. So very excited about what this product entails. \nBrittany Bagley: I'll take your second question. Great question. I would say both Fusus and Dedrone are small. They are growing fast but they're immaterial to our top line and really immaterial to our overall growth rate. So we've incorporated that all into the guidance we're giving for the year.\n Where you see a little bit more of an impact is us being cautious on EBITDA, just given absorbing those businesses and having integration costs to really make sure we pull them in and do a good job. And so as you see us not pulling the Q1 EBITDA margin through to the rest of the year, you really see us accounting for some of those impacts and where we need to invest. \nUnknown Executive: We'll take our next question from Alyssa Shreves at Barclays. Alyssa are you on? Might be muted on your phone. We'll skip for now. We'll go to Will Power at Baird. \nWilliam Power: Congratulations on the strong Q1 results. I guess first question really probably for whoever wants to take it. Obviously, strong mid-30s percent revenue growth in Q1. If you look at the full year guide, while raised, it does imply some deceleration. So just love to get a perspective on any level of pull forward into Q1 versus conservatism for the remainder of the year? Any broader thoughts on that front would be great. \nJoshua Isner: Yes. Thanks a lot, Will. Nice to see you. I'd say, as usual, we like to see more of the year materializing before we get out over our skis on total revenue for the year. So we're off to a nice start. We see the pipeline very strong. We're excited about what Q2 and beyond will hold.\n It's also worth noting the year-over-year comp for Q1 is always the easiest comp of the year in terms of Q1 tends to be the slowest revenue quarter. And so yes, we're just -- it's not -- we don't have any kind of pessimism out there or any reason not to think we're going to have another great year. We'd just like to see that materialize in terms of throughout the year in the sales cycle, and we'll certainly update that quarterly as we always do. \nBrittany Bagley: Yes, I would just add, nothing sort of embedded in there other than the fact that we're lapping a very, very strong year last year. \nWilliam Power: Yes. That all makes sense. If I can just ask a quick second question on TASER. Maybe -- can you just update on how the automation process is going? Where you are with respect to having enough supply to meet demand? Maybe any other color on the gross margin commentary there because as you automate and over time, that should help gross margins, but it sounds like it's probably the initial investment maybe that's impacting it. Just I wanted to get some color on that front. \nBrittany Bagley: Yes. I think you sort of summarized that really well, which is we're in this balance between focusing on ramping capacity and really working on cost-down initiatives, and we continue to see better demand than we've even expected for TASER 10. And so we continue to be in that area where we're really ramping capacity. You saw that come through in 33% growth in Q1. I mean that was because we had more supply available. So I think the team is doing a really nice job getting that capacity online and supporting that customer demand.\n It might take us a little bit longer to hit some of those cost-down initiatives as we hit that balance. But ultimately, that's just a matter of timing, one quarter to the next as we figure out how to slot that in. I would say overall, it's going nicely and is on track.\n And then as you look at our gross margins for the rest of the year, you also have a general mix shift balance that we do our best to look into our crystal ball and try and figure out software versus our devices versus our TASER business. And I would say devices were a little bit lighter and software was pretty strong in this Q1. And so as we go through the year, I'd expect some health and devices to balance that down a bit. So that's -- that's all that's embedded in us trying to say that, that gross margin guidance is probably not going to get better for the year than it was in Q1. \nUnknown Executive: We'll go to Keith Housum at Northcoast. \nKeith Housum: Question for you, Josh here. In terms of maybe a seasonality to the type of business. You guys have grown so much over the years. And if we look at last year fourth quarter, it was a tremendous bookings quarter for yet, obviously, not so much this quarter. Probably the first time I remember a sequential decline. Maybe to talk about how you're thinking about the seasonality of your bookings as we look for the next -- this year and the next several years? \nJoshua Isner: Yes. Yes, Keith, great question, and I appreciate it. I think ultimately, a very similar story as Q1 last year, where bookings were kind of the low point of the year in Q1. Its a hard quarter to really rack up bookings for a couple of reasons.\n Number one, like you said, we're coming off a really strong one where we kind of cash the chips in and in Q4 where we can. But then we go through a cycle where we add salespeople. That means the regions change, and that means just getting up to speed on the book of business. There's not a lot of urgency on the customer side because like I said in my remarks, Q1 is the only quarter of the year where no major fiscal budgets and really only the U.K. ends in Q1. And so it's -- Q1 is about kind of building the foundation, rebuilding the pipeline, but I can tell you, I see no red flags in bookings for the remainder of the year.\n I think the team is going to respond really strongly. I think it's always nice. We've got a really, really good sales team. And when we can kind of light a fire under them after kind of a so-so quarter, that usually tends to lead to some good out quarter results, and that's certainly what I expect here in quarters 2, 3 and 4. So yes, I'd say for the future, I'd consider Q1 kind of the seasonal low point to be expected for bookings, but really not an indicator of what's to come here in the future. \nKeith Housum: Okay. And a follow-up question in terms of federal. Federal last year had another great year -- or a great year for bookings. Are we seeing [ loans ] start to deploy here? Or are those going to be it a little bit longer, I guess, deployment schedule? How do we think about that kind of contributing to your overall revenue growth? \nJoshua Isner: These -- a lot of these large federal bookings, they are phased into multiple years. And so we tend to recognize revenue when the product is deployed or when it's shipped on the TASER side. And so of those phased deployments that are previous bookings, there's just some noisiness and when the shipments are sent and when the deployments are done, but Federal is in that bucket of when I said we had a really, really healthy pipeline for the rest of the year. We're feeling great about where the federal business is headed. We've got some large opportunities here in the next few quarters and certainly expect federal to register another awesome year. \nUnknown Executive: Thanks, Keith. Next, we have Josh Reilly at Needham. \nJoshua Reilly: So following this body cam issue with the New York Department of Corrections from a competitor solution, the NYPD, as we know, is a customer for you guys in other areas of their police force with body cameras. Can you just speak to how quickly you could move in, if asked with the replacement product there? And maybe just from a higher level, like what have you done from an engineering perspective to ensure that your cameras don't catch on fire from battery malfunctions? \nJoshua Isner: Yes, Josh. Thanks a lot. And the first thing I want to say about this is there is a captain that was injured as part of this. And so our thoughts are with him -- it's really a bad scenario when this type of stuff happens and you indicated there might be a business opportunity here. We'll see what happens with that. We're certainly -- we feel good about our ability to deploy products. We've invested a lot into them. We've invested a lot into the deployment, and we have the opportunity, of course, we'll be ready to go.\n But in the meantime, we're just -- we're focused on what's in front of us, and that's continuing to build great products. Like you alluded to, we've invested a lot into our hardware and into our devices pillar, and we have great people and thinking through all of these kind of fringe and edge case scenarios that could pop up with the hardware. And so we're not going to kind of disclose any trade secrets here, any in-depth engineering, I will say we've thought through a lot of these potential edge cases, and we feel good about how our products will perform in them. And so in the meantime, we'll keep just doing what's in front of us and what we're in control of. And if an opportunity presents itself, we'll be ready. \nJoshua Reilly: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the TASER revenue strength in the quarter here. Is there anything to call out in terms of TASER 10 domestic strength versus international being stronger? I know you had some big opportunities there for the 7 in Australia. And then just balancing that versus the automation coming on. Was the automation of benefit in Q1 because I was thinking that was a little bit more tilted for the automation equipment taking hold in the second half. \nJoshua Isner: Yes. Maybe I'll cover the demand and then we talk about the automation after. I mean, TASER 10 is a monster, Josh, like it's the most popular TASER device we have ever brought to market. It's out cycling the TASER 10 -- or TASER 7 demand by double. We continue to see strong indicators from all over the world that this product is the one that is a meaningful step in outperforming a firearm, and it puts us on that moonshot journey that we've talked a lot about, and it's a credit to Rick and our entire TASER pillar for all the great work they're doing to ramp this product and do so with high quality.\n And so I think with demand, there is a need to ramp faster. We want to get this device out to our customers as fast as we can because we really believe it will save lives. And so we're working through that. Of course, we have to invest more in automation to maximize our build capacity every quarter, and we're in the process of doing so. But future is very, very bright on the TASER 10 side. \nUnknown Executive: We'll go to Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum. \nJeremy Hamblin: I wanted to talk a little bit more in-depth about -- so the acquisition as well as just the new product opportunities, you've had a this is a pretty substantial increase in your TAM, and you've had that on a couple of occasions here over the last 6 or 7 years, but this is among the most significant. And just getting a sense for Dedrone, which gather there's quite a bit of sensitivity out there in how this is going to be used, potential for pushback in the community.\n Give us a sense for how you expect that to be deployed through your customer segments as they stand today. Is this the type of product where while it's immaterial now, do you see it potentially as a material contributor, let's say, in 2 to 3 years? \nPatrick Smith: Yes. Let me take that one to get started. A few years ago, when we were standing up Axon Air, our business leader there, had an important insight that as important as drones are, probably even more important is going to be how public safety can deal with the new threats that drones pose. And that was before what we've seen recently in world events, where in modern warfare turns out these small consumer-level drones are a real game changer, but they're also presenting new threats to everyone from stadiums to critical infrastructure to major events.\n And so actually, with Dedrone, we don't see a lot of pushback because Dedrone is really about monitoring drones in the aerospace. And again, especially given the new threat vector that, that represents, we're seeing pretty widespread support that people expect their local government, their public safety to be able to protect them and aerial threats are just an entirely new vector.\n Now the drone is a first responder, which can be enabled by Dedrone. So Dedrone both helps control aerial threats. And then if you want to deploy your own drones, having really great visibility of the aerospace is a key part of that. Now DFR does present some concerns people may have about the government flying drones. But we find it gets most people comfortable if those drones are really being used to respond to 911 calls and people can understand that, that gets police eyes on the scene much more quickly and can help them make better resourcing decisions, but these are not being flown, just hovering over the population. They're really being used to respond to calls for help. That, combined with good transparency about drone missions that are being flown and how they're being used in publicizing their policy helps most agencies I think really gained a lot of public support.\n So to finish out, we see this as being very material to the future. We think drones are already proving to be transformative and will only become more so. \nBrittany Bagley: I would just say from a timing standpoint, echo Rick fully. I think there's a question of, is it from a financial standpoint, is it 2 to 3 years from now? Is it longer? I mean it will certainly be a really big pillar of our business, and you can see us investing heavily behind robotic security. I think we are really seeding a long-term growth trajectory, though, a business that's going to be material for many years in the future, more than targeting a year or 2 years from now. \nJeremy Hamblin: Got it. Helpful color. And then just following up here on Draft One, which the demand for this sounds incredible. In terms of thinking about the competitive set, there are lots of other solutions out there, although maybe not quite rolled out in the way that law enforcement is looking for just yet.\n Wanted to get a sense of how challenging you see that market in terms of entering it? Or is it that your ecosystem is such where there's a natural fit and it's giving you a competitive advantage simply because of the other product lines that you already have out there? \nPatrick Smith: Well, this is the entire reason that we invested in a record management system 6, 7 years ago was entirely because we saw this coming, but the ability to not only have your video evidence and your written records in one system, but to be able to extract one from the other would be critical. And I think we're really seeing that come to bear. So we always want to stay a little paranoid about competition. It's a very competitive market.\n But we think between the combination of the ecosystem just really providing a great user experience and what we invest in earning customer trust and support and the rigor with which we've evaluated the risks and really dealt with all of the critical players, whether it's from community concerns through district attorneys and legal concerns across the board. I think we've done this in a way that our customers can know that this is a pretty well vetted approach.\n And obviously, AI can be a bit controversial. And we intentionally chose an area that is very high payback for our customers with very minimal risk compared to some other areas where using AI today may introduce more risk here, we think, given especially because it's derived from the body camera video, it's derived directly from the evidentiary record, which we think leads to actually even better, more detailed, more accurate police reports. \nJeffrey Kunins: Just building on what Rick said, as always, we obsess about our customers, while being healthily self-aware about the competitive landscape. And that's one of the reasons we talk about the ecosystem so much as you were talking about. We've had transcription of the audio from body camera video at scale with a very large number of customers building up and up for several years now. We've got the footprint of both our body cameras themselves and them and the growing momentum in records. And all that together is sort of the perfect tee up that makes Draft One possible.\n And then the second thing, as Rick was saying, a lot of people talk about the concepts of responsible AI and using these techniques in ways that combine effective results for customers with doing it in a principled and appropriate way, and Draft One really is that actually put into action. And it's why we're so proud of it and why we are -- we believe customers are showing the early excitement for it. \nUnknown Executive: Next, we have Trevor Walsh with JMP. \nTrevor Walsh: Rick, maybe one for you. It was great to hear all the commentary around kind of opportunities around AI coming out of Axon Fleet. I wonder if you could just ponder or kind of pontificate a little bit for us around the kind of nature of data and AI versus the sensors that sort of drive that. Is there any worries for a product for such as Fusus, for example, it's relying on not just Axon proprietary data, but things coming from other places where vendors don't necessarily start to play as nice in the sandbox when we kind of realized -- or [ I think I ] realized that AI is kind of the new -- or the data for AI is kind of the new gold. So that become an issue in terms of people kind of sharing that data kind of on a more longer-term basis. \nPatrick Smith: Well, we certainly haven't seen it yet. And most of the partners that are sharing in through Fusus, I mean those are really members of the community, businesses, other enterprises, churches, schools, partner government agencies that are sharing that data primarily because they want to be safer, and they want to be able to have that data, put to use to be able to help police do their jobs better and identify whether it's criminal activity or solve crimes. So we haven't seen people sort of pushing back against using that data responsibly to protect them better. Jeff, I don't know if you have any color you might want to add on that? \nJeffrey Kunins: Sure. No, and thanks so much for the question. Again, I mean, you're right on both fronts, right? One is it is the case that having aggregated access to large amounts of data are a really powerful differentiator. And one of the things -- one of the reasons why we put so much into everything we've built over the last years, and it's one of the things that we think enables us to keep building and building in differentiated ways.\n At the same time, one of the key incentives that helps us -- or not worry as much about the particular concern you noted is that -- for the most part, all of this data is, in fact, our customers' data ultimately, and they are the ones where they choose to work with multiple vendors and partners, [ us ] and sensors and providers of other kinds as well as businesses in their community, they themselves get to vote with their feet about how they want the various tools they choose to work with, including us to work together. And so they are a really powerful voice there. that incentivizes all of us to play nicely in the sandbox, while working to keep making our individual products as differentiated as possible. \nTrevor Walsh: That's terrific. I really appreciate the color there. Maybe one quick follow-up, maybe one quick follow up, maybe piggyback a bit about some of the Dedrone comments. How much do you intend to kind of lean into the more counter UAS counter-driven type use cases, whether that's for [ safety ] or some of the non kind of[ public ] safety customers that [indiscernible] either? \nPatrick Smith: Yes. I would say we intend to lean in pretty hard. So our goal is to protect life. And to the degree that drones are being used to threaten lives, we see that as 100% in our mission set to try to create new ways to protect from those risks. So we see this could end up being a real opportunity where Dedrone not only is useful to our existing customers, but Dedrone is interesting to a new set of customers, for example, major sporting stadiums, critical infrastructure and indeed, military, both U.S. and internationally, they have a customer set that is new for us and can bring our ecosystem into those customers as well. \nUnknown Executive: Up next, we have Joe Cardoso at JPMorgan. \nJoseph Cardoso: First one here, I just wanted to follow up on the Dedrone questions. Obviously, you've been working with them for a while. And this isn't the first time you pulled the trigger on acquiring a partner of yours that you guys think there's value in owning. Just curious why right now is the right time for you guys to acquire them? Has there been any change in terms of like -- I know you talked to the time line, but maybe is there some type of change that maybe we don't appreciate. And then maybe just -- can you just talk about has there been any change relative to your thoughts around participating? Or sorry, which parts of the technology stack you want to participate as it relates to the drone opportunity and whether that differs in what you're doing currently around like TASER and body cams. And then I have a follow-up. \nPatrick Smith: So Jeff, do you want to take first crack at that one? \nBrittany Bagley: Maybe I'll do timing of why now, and then Jeff can talk about the technology pieces.\n So I think there's a couple of things. One, we knew we were going to get a bit more active from an M&A standpoint as why we opportunistically strengthened our balance sheet and did our capital raise back in the fall of 2022. And so that was really so that we could go out and be methodical and pick up some of these pieces of the puzzle where we really wanted to strengthen the road map and the pillars and Rick has consistently been talking about the importance of robotic security. And so both Sky-Hero and Dedrone fit squarely into his vision for what robotic security for us in the future, everything from the indoor tactical drones of Sky-Hero to having Dedrone help support DFR and help support counter drone in all of those markets.\n That just goes back to timing of like when does it feel right for them, given everything else they have on their plate and what they're thinking about as an independent company versus when it makes sense to come together with us. And so I think nothing big out there that we're not talking about other than the fact that it felt right timing-wise for them and for us. They were a partner of ours. We had invested in them before we very much knew when we made that investment that we might make an acquisition, and this is the timing that sort of worked out for both sides from an acquisition standpoint. \nJeffrey Kunins: Yes. And then just building from there, again, great question about the ecosystem. I've personally spent my sort of 3 decades across lots of the businesses I worked in on these kinds of ecosystems that are always this delicate balance between thinking about where do you build by partner, et cetera. And those things evolve over time and you're always trying to decide at each layer of the stack, where they're the best opportunities to really, really partner well with other fantastic teams and other fantastic providers and where, over time, can you get the most leverage by self-building or by growing organically.\n And as you see with us, that's an evolving target, but what it combines all of those decisions over time is looking to see, based on where we are now, where we see ourselves going, what's the best combinations of where we can join forces with others while self-building ourselves at both across the hardware and software side of things?\n As you can see, for example, with drones, we made a very surgical and key decision with Sky-Hero in bringing in this very focused tactical drug hardware provider. You see the work we've done with PSS and then all of the organic build you see us do everywhere and we'll continue to evaluate that stuff carefully and be as smart as we can as we go. \nJoseph Cardoso: I appreciate the color there. And then maybe for my second question, just on the CapEx raised today. Maybe you can just talk us through what's driving the confidence to accelerate your investment plans this early into the year. Like obviously, you talked about it as being like a slower bookings quarter, but the pipeline is growing. So maybe you can just dive into that why pull the investments today versus 90 days in the future, right?\n And then just maybe a second part of that is just as we think about these investments coming online, should we think about it as being more gradual over time, adding more automation and then capacity coming on slowly? Or is this more of a we should expect some kind of inflection and bigger magnitude in a later quarter? Any color around the timing associated with the capacity acceleration or capacity investment acceleration would be appreciated. \nBrittany Bagley: Yes, sure. So I would focus you on the part of Josh's commentary when he said it's the best pipeline we've ever had coming out of Q1 and really drive you there. I think what you're hearing from us is like, yes, we had slightly softer future contracted revenue in Q1, but that is not at all indicative of how we see the year going, which I think you can see from our guidance and our commentary. And so as we look out at pipeline, as we look at the demand for TASER 10, as we look at the 33% growth in Q1, we basically said that in order to keep meeting that demand, and we don't want our customers to have to wait too long for our products that we needed to invest in more capacity.\n And then the way we invest in capacity is we're buying pretty specialized equipment to run our lines and do our manufacturing, and so there's lead times associated with that. So right now, we have to start making investments to support capacity increases in 2025 basically at this point.\n So there's no inflection point. You just see us nicely and slowly ramping our capacity increases, maybe not fully, but steadily ramping our capacity increases to meet that demand. And trying to get out in front of it so that we don't get caught in 2025, saying we don't have the ability to meet demand, and we're going to have to backlog our customers for a significant amount of time.\n So that's really just what we're seeing is making sure we're getting ahead and being prepared for 2025. If we waited 90 days, that would just mean we were bringing it on 90 days later in 2025 when we got ramped up and I think we have enough confidence. I'm telling you we have enough confidence in the pipeline and the demand that it's prudent for us to bring that online. \nUnknown Executive: We'll take our last question from Mike Ng at Goldman Sachs. \nMichael Ng: I have two as well. First, just on Axon and Cloud Services, it was up $12 million quarter-on-quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the sequential growth in this line? Is this low double-digit dollar growth sequentially still a good way to think about it? Qualitatively, is this more user base driven with the growth in the installed base across body and fleet? Or are we beginning to see more software and, I'll call it, ARPU uplift from records and standards in dispatch? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nBrittany Bagley: Yes, so our step-up quarter-over-quarter was almost $13 million. I would say part of that was in Q4 last year. We had a really big step up. Part of that was from revenue recognition. We've talked particularly about how with records coming online, some of that revenue recognition is going to be a little bit lumpy. So we had a particularly large quarter in Q4, and then that leads to a slightly smaller step Q4 to Q1.\n But I also think $13 million continues to be a pretty healthy step and sort of in line with what we've indicated is, like if you averaged out our quarter that feels like a pretty normal step up each quarter. \nMichael Ng: Great. And then I was wondering if you could comment on some of the Axon wins that have been reported in the media -- how is RCMP field testing going? Are there any themes across the wins in Cornelius, North Carolina or Puerto Rico? I know some of them were from a large competitor. So any themes in terms of product or costs that are driving those wins? \nMike Garnreiter: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Great question. I'm going to give you a little bit more of a general answer on them. I think we've said this a lot about our international business that we aren't going to be and we're not aspiring to be the kind of low-cost vendor in the space. We believe what we've built is really, really valuable. And we believe that we can perform and our products can perform in the field just as we say they will in the written solicitations. And that's not always the case for other vendors in this space.\n And so at times, a customer upfront might focus on cost and say, hey, this is the lowest price point. And then when they start to use the products and test them out and see what they do well and where the shortcomings are, they might feel like, hey, the ROI is such that we should look at a product that's priced differently even if it's higher. And oftentimes, that's where we've come in internationally. And while it takes a little bit of discipline on the front end, we think it's the right long-term winning strategy because we do really have a lot of conviction that what we've built a police officer is lesser served with something else in their hands or on their chest or on their belt. And so we've got a lot of conviction that's the right strategy, and we're starting to see that play out in international markets. \nUnknown Executive: Thanks Mike. I thinks that's it for questions today. We'll turn it over to Rick to close this out. \nPatrick Smith: Awesome right. Well, thanks, Eric, and thanks again to all of you for joining. I'm really proud of our entire team and the incredible execution they continue to show. We'll be really excited to come to you with more updates later this year, and we look forward to seeing you all again in August.",

            "name": "Joshua Isner",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon to everybody. I'm humbled to share more about another excellent quarter at Axon.\n While we continue to build out the operating system of public safety, the team has not lost focus on the importance of execution. There's no doubt in my mind, we have the best and most well-equipped team in our industry, and our first quarter results are further proof of that.\n I feel really good about our momentum to start 2024. We started the year running at full speed as the team closed out 2023 with our strongest bookings quarter in company history. In Q1, we worked hard to set the stage for the remainder of the year.\n Since it is the only quarter in which very few budgets close, we focus on pipeline development and key customer-facing hiring initiatives. I am happy to report that our pipeline is the strongest and is the healthiest it has ever been across all major customer segments. This is a testament to our awesome R&D teams that continue to zero in on strong product market fit across our entire portfolio, driving this type of record demand.\n Weather, it's TASER 10, now being more directly linked to VR training within our TASER platform, or our on-body cameras, changing the game for real-time operations or Draft One revolutionizing the RMS category there's so much for us to bring to the market, and we are just at the beginning of what we think will be a deep increase in the ways we leverage technology and public safety for the better over the next decade.\n Looking ahead, I see many opportunities for continued growth. We believe our domestic state and local law enforcement customers are eager to adopt the new products that we have brought to the market and we are seeing our emerging markets become more meaningful contributors to our results.\n One of the many things that gets me excited about Dedrone is their strong international presence, which could accelerate our international channel expansion. On that note, I'd like to share our excitement in welcoming Cameron Brooks as our new Chief Revenue Officer. Cameron came to us from Amazon Web Services, where he most recently led their Europe, Middle East and Africa business for the public sector. As we look to drive more cloud adoption across the world, Cameron's wealth of experience and spurring international cloud adoption will be a powerful asset to our team. Cameron joining Axon is a perfect example of how our mission and our unique approach to the market helps us attract the best talent from some of the most successful companies in tech.\n Before I pass it over to Brittany, I want to briefly highlight how grateful I am for my teammates at Axon. We have spent the last 2 years fortifying and rebuilding our leadership team, and we are ready to move faster than ever. We are focused on the right areas to continue delivering in the quarters and years to come, both on our financial commitments and on our mission. We just recorded our ninth consecutive quarter of greater than 25% revenue growth, and our business has approximately quadrupled over the last 5 years. We're also delivering our strongest adjusted EBITDA margins in more than 3 years as promised.\n This kind of compounding does not happen without the best people and the best products and without a lot of things going right behind the scenes. While it's always encouraging to deliver such strong results, we continue to embrace our next play mindset and put our collective organizational energy behind the most important metric of all, and that is lives saved.\n And with that, I'll pass it over to you, Brittany. Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Rick, did you want to lead us off? I saw you speaking there. Yes. Just add to that, ultimately, there will be a sales cycle associated with it, just like anything in selling the government, but I think we're already seeing some early orders come in and the pipeline is building. We think in the second half of this year and especially going into next year, we'll see this start to really contribute to in-quarter revenue and ultimately at a high margin as well.\n So we're very excited of about what this will entail for our results, but most excited about the fact that in a climate where it's very hard to add police officers to police forces, that we have the propensity to put police officers back on the street instead of behind the computer here without having to make any incremental hires from the outside. So very excited about what this product entails. Yes. Thanks a lot, Will. Nice to see you. I'd say, as usual, we like to see more of the year materializing before we get out over our skis on total revenue for the year. So we're off to a nice start. We see the pipeline very strong. We're excited about what Q2 and beyond will hold.\n It's also worth noting the year-over-year comp for Q1 is always the easiest comp of the year in terms of Q1 tends to be the slowest revenue quarter. And so yes, we're just -- it's not -- we don't have any kind of pessimism out there or any reason not to think we're going to have another great year. We'd just like to see that materialize in terms of throughout the year in the sales cycle, and we'll certainly update that quarterly as we always do. Yes. Yes, Keith, great question, and I appreciate it. I think ultimately, a very similar story as Q1 last year, where bookings were kind of the low point of the year in Q1. Its a hard quarter to really rack up bookings for a couple of reasons.\n Number one, like you said, we're coming off a really strong one where we kind of cash the chips in and in Q4 where we can. But then we go through a cycle where we add salespeople. That means the regions change, and that means just getting up to speed on the book of business. There's not a lot of urgency on the customer side because like I said in my remarks, Q1 is the only quarter of the year where no major fiscal budgets and really only the U.K. ends in Q1. And so it's -- Q1 is about kind of building the foundation, rebuilding the pipeline, but I can tell you, I see no red flags in bookings for the remainder of the year.\n I think the team is going to respond really strongly. I think it's always nice. We've got a really, really good sales team. And when we can kind of light a fire under them after kind of a so-so quarter, that usually tends to lead to some good out quarter results, and that's certainly what I expect here in quarters 2, 3 and 4. So yes, I'd say for the future, I'd consider Q1 kind of the seasonal low point to be expected for bookings, but really not an indicator of what's to come here in the future. These -- a lot of these large federal bookings, they are phased into multiple years. And so we tend to recognize revenue when the product is deployed or when it's shipped on the TASER side. And so of those phased deployments that are previous bookings, there's just some noisiness and when the shipments are sent and when the deployments are done, but Federal is in that bucket of when I said we had a really, really healthy pipeline for the rest of the year. We're feeling great about where the federal business is headed. We've got some large opportunities here in the next few quarters and certainly expect federal to register another awesome year. Yes, Josh. Thanks a lot. And the first thing I want to say about this is there is a captain that was injured as part of this. And so our thoughts are with him -- it's really a bad scenario when this type of stuff happens and you indicated there might be a business opportunity here. We'll see what happens with that. We're certainly -- we feel good about our ability to deploy products. We've invested a lot into them. We've invested a lot into the deployment, and we have the opportunity, of course, we'll be ready to go.\n But in the meantime, we're just -- we're focused on what's in front of us, and that's continuing to build great products. Like you alluded to, we've invested a lot into our hardware and into our devices pillar, and we have great people and thinking through all of these kind of fringe and edge case scenarios that could pop up with the hardware. And so we're not going to kind of disclose any trade secrets here, any in-depth engineering, I will say we've thought through a lot of these potential edge cases, and we feel good about how our products will perform in them. And so in the meantime, we'll keep just doing what's in front of us and what we're in control of. And if an opportunity presents itself, we'll be ready. Yes. Maybe I'll cover the demand and then we talk about the automation after. I mean, TASER 10 is a monster, Josh, like it's the most popular TASER device we have ever brought to market. It's out cycling the TASER 10 -- or TASER 7 demand by double. We continue to see strong indicators from all over the world that this product is the one that is a meaningful step in outperforming a firearm, and it puts us on that moonshot journey that we've talked a lot about, and it's a credit to Rick and our entire TASER pillar for all the great work they're doing to ramp this product and do so with high quality.\n And so I think with demand, there is a need to ramp faster. We want to get this device out to our customers as fast as we can because we really believe it will save lives. And so we're working through that. Of course, we have to invest more in automation to maximize our build capacity every quarter, and we're in the process of doing so. But future is very, very bright on the TASER 10 side."

            "content": "Thank you, Josh. We're very proud of the results again this quarter for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We had 34% top line growth on top of 34% growth in Q1 last year, supported by our cloud and services revenue, which grew 51.5% year-over-year. This came from growth in both users and premium product add-ons driving upsell.\n Demand for TASER 10 also remained robust and drove 33% growth year-over-year in our TASER segment, supported by increasing supply availability. Sensors and other revenue grew 14% year-over-year with the adoption of Axon Body 4 driving camera revenue, somewhat offset by lapping the big catch-up in fleet revenue from Q1 last year as we're now at more normalized deployment levels.\n In addition to healthy growth across all our categories, we see strength across our end markets. In Q1, over 25% of our revenue came from outside domestic law enforcement, including international, federal, other adjacent markets like corrections in Justice and Enterprise. Our ARR for the quarter is $825 million, up almost 50% year-over-year, and it now includes Fusus and our TASER warranty revenue. We continue to maintain a net revenue retention of 122%.\n In Q1, we introduced adjusted gross margin to normalize for increased stock-based compensation resulting from the grants we made to employees whose compensation was under a specified threshold, many of whom are in manufacturing. As a reminder, we've committed to keeping our stock-based compensation at or below an average annual dilution of 3% for 2025 and beyond, and this is in keeping with that commitment.\n Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 63.2%, up from 61.5% in Q4. This improvement was from product mix benefit as well as the fact we didn't have any onetime reserves hit this quarter. We do expect some pressure on gross margin for the rest of the year as we continue to balance mix shift and ramping T10 capacity.\n Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin increased year-over-year from 19% to 23.6%, representing a 460 basis point improvement. In addition to the benefit of strong gross margins, we saw operating leverage contribute approximately 110 basis points year-over-year. As Josh mentioned, this is our strongest adjusted EBITDA margin quarter in 3 years since COVID.\n We continue to balance driving strong top line growth with investing in the business. We're pleased to be able to do this both organically and inorganically and are thrilled about our plans to welcome the Dedrone team to Axon. Rick did a great job talking through the strategic rationale.\n From a financial standpoint, we expect to close the deal sometime over the summer and to have approximately one full quarter of financials included in our 2024 results. This timing is subject to customary closing conditions. We expect that the potential acquisition of Dedrone would increase our TAM by $14 billion, bringing our overall addressable market to $77 billion. Dedrone is still investing for growth, and we expect incremental costs from their business and from integration that would have a slight impact to our core adjusted EBITDA margin. We've tried to factor this into our updated guidance and should be able to further refine these assumptions next quarter.\n Today, Dedrone is small relative to our overall business, and once closed, you will see them incorporated into our Software and Sensors segment. Dedrone highlights another step in our M&A strategy of acquiring talent and technology that complements our road map and expands our addressable market. In total, our acquisitions of Sky-Hero and Fusus and our planned acquisition of Dedrone have expanded our TAM by more than 50% over the last year from $50 billion to $77 billion. The acquisitions also increased our capabilities in robotic security and real-time operations, both areas we view as critical to the future of policing and our other markets, and we are excited to continue delivering on our product vision.\n Finally, I'll turn to our guidance. We are increasing our full year 2024 expected revenue guidance to $1.94 billion to $1.99 billion, which represents approximately 26% annual growth at the midpoint, above the prior high end of our guidance range of 20% to 24%. This incorporates both our outperformance in Q1 and our increased expectations for the year.\n While future contracted revenue was down slightly quarter-over-quarter to $7 billion in Q1, we have a strong pipeline for the year to underpin our forecast. We have also included an immaterial amount of revenue we expect to come from Dedrone this year, reflecting everything we currently know.\n We expect adjusted EBITDA of $430 million to $445 million, which implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22% up year-over-year and approximately in line with our prior guidance on margin. This includes our best estimate of integration costs and impact from M&A on the year.\n Finally, we've also increased our expected investment in CapEx to $80 million to $95 million for the year as we are continuing to ramp our capacity investments to meet the strong demand for TASER 10. We're very pleased with these results and think the quarter demonstrates continued execution on our business across both the top and bottom line as well as strong investments for the future so we can continue to deliver outsized performance.\n And with that, I would like to open it up to questions. I'll take your second question. Great question. I would say both Fusus and Dedrone are small. They are growing fast but they're immaterial to our top line and really immaterial to our overall growth rate. So we've incorporated that all into the guidance we're giving for the year.\n Where you see a little bit more of an impact is us being cautious on EBITDA, just given absorbing those businesses and having integration costs to really make sure we pull them in and do a good job. And so as you see us not pulling the Q1 EBITDA margin through to the rest of the year, you really see us accounting for some of those impacts and where we need to invest. Yes, I would just add, nothing sort of embedded in there other than the fact that we're lapping a very, very strong year last year. Yes. I think you sort of summarized that really well, which is we're in this balance between focusing on ramping capacity and really working on cost-down initiatives, and we continue to see better demand than we've even expected for TASER 10. And so we continue to be in that area where we're really ramping capacity. You saw that come through in 33% growth in Q1. I mean that was because we had more supply available. So I think the team is doing a really nice job getting that capacity online and supporting that customer demand.\n It might take us a little bit longer to hit some of those cost-down initiatives as we hit that balance. But ultimately, that's just a matter of timing, one quarter to the next as we figure out how to slot that in. I would say overall, it's going nicely and is on track.\n And then as you look at our gross margins for the rest of the year, you also have a general mix shift balance that we do our best to look into our crystal ball and try and figure out software versus our devices versus our TASER business. And I would say devices were a little bit lighter and software was pretty strong in this Q1. And so as we go through the year, I'd expect some health and devices to balance that down a bit. So that's -- that's all that's embedded in us trying to say that, that gross margin guidance is probably not going to get better for the year than it was in Q1. I would just say from a timing standpoint, echo Rick fully. I think there's a question of, is it from a financial standpoint, is it 2 to 3 years from now? Is it longer? I mean it will certainly be a really big pillar of our business, and you can see us investing heavily behind robotic security. I think we are really seeding a long-term growth trajectory, though, a business that's going to be material for many years in the future, more than targeting a year or 2 years from now. Maybe I'll do timing of why now, and then Jeff can talk about the technology pieces.\n So I think there's a couple of things. One, we knew we were going to get a bit more active from an M&A standpoint as why we opportunistically strengthened our balance sheet and did our capital raise back in the fall of 2022. And so that was really so that we could go out and be methodical and pick up some of these pieces of the puzzle where we really wanted to strengthen the road map and the pillars and Rick has consistently been talking about the importance of robotic security. And so both Sky-Hero and Dedrone fit squarely into his vision for what robotic security for us in the future, everything from the indoor tactical drones of Sky-Hero to having Dedrone help support DFR and help support counter drone in all of those markets.\n That just goes back to timing of like when does it feel right for them, given everything else they have on their plate and what they're thinking about as an independent company versus when it makes sense to come together with us. And so I think nothing big out there that we're not talking about other than the fact that it felt right timing-wise for them and for us. They were a partner of ours. We had invested in them before we very much knew when we made that investment that we might make an acquisition, and this is the timing that sort of worked out for both sides from an acquisition standpoint. Yes, sure. So I would focus you on the part of Josh's commentary when he said it's the best pipeline we've ever had coming out of Q1 and really drive you there. I think what you're hearing from us is like, yes, we had slightly softer future contracted revenue in Q1, but that is not at all indicative of how we see the year going, which I think you can see from our guidance and our commentary. And so as we look out at pipeline, as we look at the demand for TASER 10, as we look at the 33% growth in Q1, we basically said that in order to keep meeting that demand, and we don't want our customers to have to wait too long for our products that we needed to invest in more capacity.\n And then the way we invest in capacity is we're buying pretty specialized equipment to run our lines and do our manufacturing, and so there's lead times associated with that. So right now, we have to start making investments to support capacity increases in 2025 basically at this point.\n So there's no inflection point. You just see us nicely and slowly ramping our capacity increases, maybe not fully, but steadily ramping our capacity increases to meet that demand. And trying to get out in front of it so that we don't get caught in 2025, saying we don't have the ability to meet demand, and we're going to have to backlog our customers for a significant amount of time.\n So that's really just what we're seeing is making sure we're getting ahead and being prepared for 2025. If we waited 90 days, that would just mean we were bringing it on 90 days later in 2025 when we got ramped up and I think we have enough confidence. I'm telling you we have enough confidence in the pipeline and the demand that it's prudent for us to bring that online. Yes, so our step-up quarter-over-quarter was almost $13 million. I would say part of that was in Q4 last year. We had a really big step up. Part of that was from revenue recognition. We've talked particularly about how with records coming online, some of that revenue recognition is going to be a little bit lumpy. So we had a particularly large quarter in Q4, and then that leads to a slightly smaller step Q4 to Q1.\n But I also think $13 million continues to be a pretty healthy step and sort of in line with what we've indicated is, like if you averaged out our quarter that feels like a pretty normal step up each quarter."

            "name": "Patrick Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and thank you all for joining us here today. I want to welcome you all to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. We have kicked off what is shaping up to be another incredible year at Axon. You saw me talk about my vision in the video we just showed you, and I'm energized by the updates we're bringing you today.\n First, one of the areas I'm obviously very excited about is drones, robotics and aerospace security. I believe drone as a first responder or DFR, is a massive opportunity ahead of us. We anticipate that it will drive faster response times and improve decision-making, giving us extra seconds and more information before we act in critical situations.\n As we push forward into this new era of aerial innovation, drones are not just helpful tools, they're becoming indispensable. At the same time, drone tracking and countermeasures become equally, if not even more important, and we believe a critical element to enable widespread drone is the first responder programs.\n DFR programs are designed to deploy drones to an emergency in advance of human first responders, enhancing situational awareness to improve response strategies, optimizing the allocation of already limited resources and reducing the risk of harm to first responders and communities.\n But limitations exist that to date have hindered the use of DFR at scale, namely current FAA requirements mandate the presence of a human virtual observer standing on a rooftop to ensure each drone remains in a direct line of sight. That means operators must be positioned in relatively close proximity to the scene, usually on rooftops and operating primarily in clear daytime conditions. That's one of the reasons I am so thrilled about our planned and announced acquisition of Dedrone. We believe Dedrone's technology solves through these limitations, allowing law enforcement to operate in low visibility conditions and the times of day without the need to maintain a human observer with a line of sight.\n The planned combination of Dedrone with Axon is a natural extension of our strategy with several tangential applications already deployed in the field, including stadium, aerospace security, along with robust military critical infrastructure and other civilian protection applications.\n Another area I'm very passionate about is the realm of artificial intelligence. I believe that we will one day look back on these times is the beginning of the AI era. AI has applications across every element of what we do and offers the potential to unlock our human capital resources to accomplish more than we've ever been able to in the past.\n In the video we showed, you briefly saw us introduce our most recent innovation here, born from our visionary initiative 7 years ago, Draft One leverages AI to produce police reports from body camera, audio and video.\n Our studies have found that officers in the U.S. spend about 40% of their time or 15 hours per week on what is essentially data entry, writing reports. This is valuable time they could be spending in their communities, with their families, in training or on their own well-being. With Draft One, we're giving them a new lifeline that we expect will save them critical hours each and every day.\n And while these two developments are massive in their potential, there are just two examples of where we're focusing our innovation and we are not slowing down and several other areas that we believe will also be critical to achieving our moonshot goal.\n We've introduced real-time operation solutions that bring situational awareness into the modern age, expanding our ecosystem to ingest networks of cameras and sensors, infuses and raising the bar for communications beyond monolithic audio to include live streaming, video and two-way voice communications through video and audio feeds.\n We introduced our new mobile application, which allows our customers to seamlessly work together on evidence management and report writing while they're on the go. And we're giving agencies new capabilities and next-level training to improve human performance under pressure in the most high stakes events with our continuously improving and expanding VR portfolio. As I reflect on what we've delivered to the market and where we're investing, I think we are still in the early chapters of an epic story.\n And before I pass it over, I want to take a minute to acknowledge that our mission is more important than ever. We've seen a number of truly unfortunate and devastating tragedies between the police and the public over just the last few months. Our thoughts are with the families and departments who are experiencing these difficult times that we are out to end. We're innovating for a better future and remain dedicated to our mission to protect life.\n And with that, I'll turn it over to Josh. Yes, I had myself on mute there. Yes, I would start by telling you, we've introduced a lot of exciting products over the years. This is probably the most enthusiasm I've seen for any product we've ever introduced. I mean, police officers did not get in this career to be writing reports, and we've done a lot of background work with our Epics and Equity Advisory Council as well as district attorneys and others looking at what the risks are and testing against those. We do make sure that we're putting speed bumps in there. So obvious that we are reviewing the final report. It's really important that it's theirs.\n But what we're seeing is pretty rapidly they're realizing the agencies and their partners, again, district attorneys and others are telling us the reports they're getting when officers are using Draft One are better than the reports that they're writing on their own. And so while it's pretty early for us to make any exact predictions, the overall friction to adoption is low. This doesn't require a lot of professional services and integration. It's pretty easy for us to turn it on. It's very simple for officers to figure out how to use. And we're finding, again, as soon as they get experience with it, their feedback is pretty fantastic. Yes. Let me take that one to get started. A few years ago, when we were standing up Axon Air, our business leader there, had an important insight that as important as drones are, probably even more important is going to be how public safety can deal with the new threats that drones pose. And that was before what we've seen recently in world events, where in modern warfare turns out these small consumer-level drones are a real game changer, but they're also presenting new threats to everyone from stadiums to critical infrastructure to major events.\n And so actually, with Dedrone, we don't see a lot of pushback because Dedrone is really about monitoring drones in the aerospace. And again, especially given the new threat vector that, that represents, we're seeing pretty widespread support that people expect their local government, their public safety to be able to protect them and aerial threats are just an entirely new vector.\n Now the drone is a first responder, which can be enabled by Dedrone. So Dedrone both helps control aerial threats. And then if you want to deploy your own drones, having really great visibility of the aerospace is a key part of that. Now DFR does present some concerns people may have about the government flying drones. But we find it gets most people comfortable if those drones are really being used to respond to 911 calls and people can understand that, that gets police eyes on the scene much more quickly and can help them make better resourcing decisions, but these are not being flown, just hovering over the population. They're really being used to respond to calls for help. That, combined with good transparency about drone missions that are being flown and how they're being used in publicizing their policy helps most agencies I think really gained a lot of public support.\n So to finish out, we see this as being very material to the future. We think drones are already proving to be transformative and will only become more so. Well, this is the entire reason that we invested in a record management system 6, 7 years ago was entirely because we saw this coming, but the ability to not only have your video evidence and your written records in one system, but to be able to extract one from the other would be critical. And I think we're really seeing that come to bear. So we always want to stay a little paranoid about competition. It's a very competitive market.\n But we think between the combination of the ecosystem just really providing a great user experience and what we invest in earning customer trust and support and the rigor with which we've evaluated the risks and really dealt with all of the critical players, whether it's from community concerns through district attorneys and legal concerns across the board. I think we've done this in a way that our customers can know that this is a pretty well vetted approach.\n And obviously, AI can be a bit controversial. And we intentionally chose an area that is very high payback for our customers with very minimal risk compared to some other areas where using AI today may introduce more risk here, we think, given especially because it's derived from the body camera video, it's derived directly from the evidentiary record, which we think leads to actually even better, more detailed, more accurate police reports. Well, we certainly haven't seen it yet. And most of the partners that are sharing in through Fusus, I mean those are really members of the community, businesses, other enterprises, churches, schools, partner government agencies that are sharing that data primarily because they want to be safer, and they want to be able to have that data, put to use to be able to help police do their jobs better and identify whether it's criminal activity or solve crimes. So we haven't seen people sort of pushing back against using that data responsibly to protect them better. Jeff, I don't know if you have any color you might want to add on that? Yes. I would say we intend to lean in pretty hard. So our goal is to protect life. And to the degree that drones are being used to threaten lives, we see that as 100% in our mission set to try to create new ways to protect from those risks. So we see this could end up being a real opportunity where Dedrone not only is useful to our existing customers, but Dedrone is interesting to a new set of customers, for example, major sporting stadiums, critical infrastructure and indeed, military, both U.S. and internationally, they have a customer set that is new for us and can bring our ecosystem into those customers as well. So Jeff, do you want to take first crack at that one? Awesome right. Well, thanks, Eric, and thanks again to all of you for joining. I'm really proud of our entire team and the incredible execution they continue to show. We'll be really excited to come to you with more updates later this year, and we look forward to seeing you all again in August."
