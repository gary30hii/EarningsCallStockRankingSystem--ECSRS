Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation. In addition, today’s presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRonald O’Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to reflect on how State Street successfully adapted to the unique operating environment in 2020, supporting our clients, communities, and the financial system, all while advancing and positioning the business for future success. 2020 was a year like no other in recent memory. As we entered the year, few could have predicted how volatile the operating market -- operating environment would be as the health crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global economic recession, which the world is still dealing with. Against that backdrop, governments, central banks, and financial institutions like State Street needed to act quickly to assist in limiting the impact of this crisis on the financial markets and the global economy. 2020 also highlighted a number of racial and social injustices that we must act to address. When faced with these economic and social challenges, I'm proud of how State Street team members around the world lived our values of being stronger together and a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities, all while generating solid earnings growth for our shareholders in 2020. As the pandemic worsened last year, our global operating capabilities allowed us to adapt quickly and deliver products, services, and results for our clients when they needed us most. In addition to the client-focused product and service enhancements we made in 2020, we continued to transform our operating model by simplifying our operations, increasing automation, and driving productivity and efficiencies while continuing to invest in our business. State Street has been on a journey to transform its operating model for the last two years, and we expect that we'll be able to deliver further improvements during 2021 to drive costs lower, self fund investments for the future, and transform how we compete and operate in the years ahead. At the same time, the volatility in markets demonstrated the strength of our global FX franchise, where we retain the number one market share position with asset managers and achieved an approximately 30% uptick in revenue. We continued our intense efforts to innovate throughout 2020 with the further development and delivery of the State Street Alpha front to back platform, which has gained traction with clients. Through the open architecture nature of the platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships with leading data and analytics providers unlocking new sources of revenue. We signed six Alpha clients in 2020 where early adoption has helped us accelerate our development. The Alpha pipeline remains strong. While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our future strategy, we also remained laser focused on improving the financial performance within investment servicing, which is the core engine of our business. We recently enhanced our institutional services client facing strategy, and during 2021 we will leverage improvements in client coverage, segments, and regions to broaden and drive investment servicing revenue growth over time. As a result, our strategic moves, the strength of our capabilities and operating model, and the commitment of our team members enabled successful navigation of 2020 and improved year-over-year financial performance, which I will now discuss further. Turning to Slide 3, fourth quarter EPS was $1.39 or $1.69 excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago period, fourth quarter total revenue declined 4% largely driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, fee revenue increased 2%, reversing recent trends and demonstrating an improved servicing and management fee performance, as well as strong FX trading results. Despite an increase in transaction processing, total expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items. At the end of the fourth quarter, AUC/A and AUM both increased to record levels supported by higher period-end markets. At Global Advisors, we had another strong performance in ETFs and cash. These results in both businesses provide good step-off points for 2021. Turning to our full year 2020 results, we made solid financial progress relative to 2019 as we work to drive fee revenue growth higher and total expenses lower. Full year EPS was $6.32 or $6.70 excluding notable items. EPS results were up 17% and 9% excluding notable items, despite the dramatically lower interest rate environment. Supported by year-over-year improvements in servicing and management fees, very strong FX trading results, and a higher revenue contribution from CRD which continues to perform well, total fee revenue increased 4%. However, total revenue was roughly flat year-over-year as a result of the impact of interest rate headwinds on NII. Our team drove total expenses down 1.5% year-over-year, excluding notable items as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense reduction that we successfully established in 2019. Operating leverage was positive, and margin was up in one of the most challenging years in history. To conclude my opening remarks, State Street faced a number of unprecedented challenges during 2020. As a result of our operational capabilities and innovation, we were able to successfully navigate those challenges all the while acting as a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities and generating solid year-over-year earnings growth for our shareholders. As we look ahead, for the first quarter of 2021, our Board has authorized up to $475 million of common stock repurchases, which is in effect the limit set by the Fed. We are well positioned for and looking forward to returning significantly more capital to shareholders in the future. In addition, the Board has also authorized the partial redemption of our Series F preferred stock, which will further benefit our common shareholders following its partial redemption in the first quarter. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail, and then I will return to update you on our medium-term targets.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 4, and before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, let me briefly outline $145 million of notable items we recognized in the fourth quarter, which totaled $0.30 of EPS that will collectively help us deliver another year of declining expenses in 2021. First, we took an employee severance charge of $82 million to eliminate approximately 1,200 positions, mostly in middle management, which will be partially offset by in-sourcing and critical hires during the year. This complements the senior management reductions we made 2 years ago and the ongoing reduction of junior roles through automation that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this to generate savings of approximately $120 million in 2021 and about twice that in the following year. Second, we took a $51 million occupancy charge for real estate to reduce our total office space across 20 sites by about 1 million square feet or approximately 13% of our total square footage. This is the start of our process of reconfiguring our office space for a post-COVID environment. We expect this action to generate savings of roughly $30 million in 2021. We try to minimize repositioning charges, but we have delivered 2 years in a row of underlying expense reduction while investing in our business and want to do so again in 2021. Turning to Slide 5, I will begin my review of both our 4Q '20 and full year 2020 results. As you can see on the top left of the table, we finished fourth quarter with strong revenues. Total fee revenue increased 2% year-on-year and was up 5% quarter-on-quarter. And while interest rate environment continues to be a headwind, the absence of the $20 million in the third quarter true-up combined with a stronger than expected balance sheet growth led to a 4% quarter-on-quarter improvement in NII. Total expenses ex notables were flat year-on-year, but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter including currency translation and higher variable costs. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2020 performance. And despite the challenging operating environment, dramatically lower interest rates and a suspension by banks, we delivered full year positive operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin and EPS growth rate of 9% excluding notable items. Our GAAP results were even better across the board. Turning to Slide 6, period end AUC/A increased 13% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $38.8 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client flows and net new business installations. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of higher period end market levels and better clients flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 11% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter to $3.5 trillion. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net ETF and cash inflows, but offset by continued institutional outflows in the equity index product line. Our SPDR ETF business recorded its second highest quarter of net inflows driven by strong U.S and European flows, taking total net ETF inflows to over $43 billion for the full-year, almost 30% higher than last year. Now on to Slide 7. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased 1% year-on-year including currency translation. The increase reflects higher average market levels, softer than expected sales in 2020, as well as lower levels of client activity and normal pricing headwinds. Servicing fees were flat quarter-on-quarter including currency translation has higher average market levels were partially offset by a continued normalization of client activity. On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators for our servicing business. AUC/A wins totaled $205 billion, while AUC/A yet to be installed amounted to $436 billion in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead, we are focused on generating the level of gross sales volume needed to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, which we think is about $1.5 trillion or more of net AUC/A each year. The amount of gross wins needs -- needed to offset these factors will vary year-to-year and be impacted by a number of factors including product mix. This would include Alpha mandates, which were over 25% of our second half AUC/A wins. So as I have mentioned before the sales cycle and inflation of these more complex solution focused services take some time. In 2020, we've had some strong success and growth across our top 50 asset manager clients, as well as within our insurance and asset owner client segments. We have been disappointed, however, with our sales to our mid size asset managers in North America and EMEA and are implementing a plan to address these areas of opportunity. On the bottom right panel, we highlight some of these tactical enhancements to our institutional services strategy, which involves expanding coverage to a total of our top 350 clients and diversifying our pipeline across segments and geographies. Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Before I began, you will notice that for the current and prior periods, we have reclassified the AUM base fees that Global Advisors receives for acting as the marketing agent for the SPDR Gold ETF from FX trading services into the management fee line. Going forward, we think this reclass better reflects the management fee performance at Global Advisors. Inclusive of this reclass, fourth quarter management fees reached $493 million, up 3% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, including the impact of currency translation. Year-on-year, management fees benefited from higher average market rates and the strong ETF inflows I mentioned earlier, partially offset by money market fee waivers of about $3 million, net institutional outflows and the timing of cash outflows. Our fourth quarter investment management pre-tax margin reached 32%, which you can see in our segment reporting in our financial addendum, and we generated significant positive operating leverage. Regarding money market fee waivers, we currently expect they will continue at the current rate of $5 million to $10 million per quarter company-wide in 2021, which is included in our outlook that I will discuss further shortly. FX trading services had another strong quarter. Fourth quarter FX revenue increased 25% year-on-year and was up 20% quarter-on-quarter, demonstrating the strength of our top ranked FX franchise for asset managers. Year-on-year and sequentially, FX revenue benefited from substantially higher indirect FX volumes as well as stronger market making revenue on elevated volatility as we help clients rebalance their global portfolios in the light of ever changing economic and political conditions. The full year 2020 FX revenue surged approximately 30%, will obviously make the 2021 year-on-year comparisons more difficult. Fourth quarter securities finance revenue fell 21% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower enhanced custody balances and agency spreads. Securities finance revenue increased 5% quarter-on-quarter, however, mainly as a result of both higher agency lending assets and higher enhanced custody balances as we saw demand for some leverage reemerge. Finally, fourth quarter software and processing fees were down 7% year-on-year due to lower on-prem CRD revenue. Software and processing fees increased 19% quarter-on-quarter as a result of sequentially stronger CRD revenue and positive market related adjustments. Moving to Slide 9, we show CRD revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated CRD revenues into its three categories, given the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the ASC 606 revenue recognition accounting standard for on- revenues in particular. Fourth quarter CRD revenue fell 9% year-on-year, largely as a result of the timing of revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2019, but was up strongly at 16% quarter-on-quarter on higher renewals. CRD demonstrated very strong revenue growth for the full year, driven in part by the success of the CRD wealth strategy earlier in the year, with total standalone CRD revenues up 14% year-on-year and with the more durable SaaS and professional services revenues growing 18% relative to full year 2019. On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the highlights of the State Street Alpha front to back platform sales during 2020. In total, we signed six Alpha clients during the year including three in 4Q, which included one new client and two clients converted from existing relationships. The Alpha pipeline remains promising as clients begin to realize the transformation of potential of the platform for their technology and portfolio management needs. Turning to Slide 10. Fourth quarter NII declined 22% year-on-year, but was up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The quarter-on-quarter increase in NII was driven by the absence of the $20 million true-up in the third quarter. Not including that true-up, the significant investment portfolio balance growth and higher average loans, coupled with a $17 billion of higher average deposits, which were worth about $10 million, and approximately $5 million of episodic FX mark-to-market swap benefits over quarter end were enough to offset the ongoing headwinds of the low interest rate environment on investment portfolio yields. Each quarter, we try to offset the persistent effect of low rates in the portfolio by taking these sorts of tactical actions. In some quarters, we'll be able to fully offset the headwind like we did here, as we put the $17 billion of the deposit surge to work, but that won't be the case every time. On the right side of the slide, we show our end of period and average balance sheet highlights. Last quarter I noted how we expect to operate around $190 billion of average deposits, but that our deposit levels might increase given the Fed's continued expansion of the money supply. As it turns out, we begin -- begun to see the tailwind and now expect to operate at even higher levels of client deposit and more in line with our fourth quarter average or even higher. We will be opportunistic from here regarding the deployment of cash and the expansion of our investment portfolio. But we also need to be mindful of currently tight credit spreads and the potential for OCI risk from interest rate changes. On Slide 11, we’ve again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex notables, so that the underlying trends are readily visible. 4Q '20 expenses were held flat year-on-year, but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter, excluding notable items and including the impact of currency translation, which was worth about a point in the fourth quarter. Relative to the third quarter and ex notables, we achieved a decline in the largest expense segment of comp and benefits, while occupancy and information systems costs were held flat. However, this was more than offset by higher transactional processing and other expenses in the fourth quarter. Transaction processing increased 10% quarter-on-quarter as a result of variable costs tied to higher market data volumes, sub custody balances and brokerage volumes. Other expenses rose 8% quarter-on-quarter as a result of higher marketing and professional fees. For the full year total expenses were down approximately 1.5% ex notables relative to 2019, demonstrating the solid progress we are making in improving our operating model as we continue to reduce expenses, sell fund investments in our business and more than offset natural expense growth. We want to be down again in 2021, which I will detail shortly. Moving to Slide 12. On the left of the slide, we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio in 2020 as we supported clients with the MMLF and we've thoughtfully put higher levels of client deposits to work to support NII. On the right of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, as you can see, we continue to navigate this challenging operating environment with extremely strong and elevated capital levels relative to our regulatory requirements. As Ron noted, we are excited that our Board authorized the new common share repurchase program for the first quarter, up to $425 million and which is in line with the new Fed limits. We're also optimizing the capital stack by redeeming $500 million of pref stock, which will have a benefit to our common stockholders starting in 2Q. Turning to Slide 13, you could see a summary of our 4Q '20 and full year 2020 results. I've already covered fourth quarter in detail. So let me say a few words about our full year results, given that we've been on a journey to turn around growth and improve margins and returns. Following a 3% decline in total fee revenues in full year 2019, we successfully drove a 4% increase in total fee revenue growth in full year 2020. Many initiatives came together to successfully make this happen. Following a 6% decline in servicing fees in full year 2019, we intervened to moderate pricing pressure, we revamped our coverage of our top 50 clients and we executed on our Alpha strategy leading to an increase in servicing fees by 2% year-on-year, which made for a real turnaround. At Global Advisors, despite a challenging year on our long-term institutional index product line, our ETF business had a very strong year with total flows up 30% year-on-year and our cash business performing quite well. Our FX trading services business had a remarkable year in 2020, as a result of higher market volatility and record client volumes, and we reap the benefit of our prior investments and our number one position with asset managers. On expenses for the full year, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive costs out of the business recording a second consecutive year of total net expense reduction, excluding notable items and adjusting for the acquisition of CRD, all the while investing in our products and capabilities. All told, excluding notable items, State Street delivered full year operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin and EPS growth of 9%, notwithstanding some of the interest rate headwinds. And GAAP results were even stronger across the board. All that said, we have more to do in 2021. So let me get into it. Turning to Slide 14, let me cover our full year 2020 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter of 2021. As I usually do, let me first share some of the assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, our rate outlook assumes that short end rates remain relatively flat, and there is some modest steepening to the yield curve in line with the current forwards and anticipates modestly slowing prepayment speeds. We're also assuming around 7 to 8 percentage point to point growth from equity markets in 2021, as well as normalized market volatility, which impacts our trading businesses. So beginning with revenue, we currently expect that fee revenue will be flat to up 2% for 2021. And fee revenue ex trading will be up 3% to 5%. This includes servicing fees growing towards the top end of the 3% to 5% range. Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect fee revenue to be down year-over-year by low single digits perhaps down to the 4%, given headwinds such as the outsized FX trading revenues we saw last year due to volatility in the early days of the pandemic in March. Regarding NII, we expect full year 2021 NII to be down 14% to 17% on a year-over-year basis, as investment portfolio yields continue to grind lower from prepayments and reinvestments. Regarding first quarter of 2021, we expect NII to be down about 68% sequentially, driven by the continued impact of lower rates and day count and should stabilize there and be somewhat range bound, assuming that our rate assumptions do not change significantly. Turning to expenses as you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex notables will be flat to down 1% on a nominal basis in 2021 due to our continued focus on resource and infrastructure optimization, and currently assume that currency translation will be a 1% headwind in this estimate. This net expense reduction includes approximately 4% to 5% of variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like CRD, Alpha and tech infrastructure and automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect expenses to be largely in line with this guide year-over-year and consistent with the seasonal expenses usually occurring in the first quarter. We also expect releases of provisions for credit losses during 2021 of at least a third of what was built in 2020. Taxes should be in the 17% to 19% range for 2021. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRonald O’Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Turning to slide 15. I would like to update you on the current thinking on our medium term targets, which we now aim to achieve by the end of 2023 on a run rate basis for 2024. At this time, we still consider these target levels to be the right ones for our business and our shareholders. As a result, they remained unchanged as you can see from the slide. However, we now expect these targets may take longer to achieve than we had initially anticipated, largely as a result of exogenous factors. We set these medium term targets in early December 2018. Soon thereafter, interest rates fell as the Fed tried to stimulate a slowing economy in 2019 and then again as COVID hit in 2020. The market went from expecting in 2018, the Fed to approach 3% by late 2019, to ending 2020 at 25 basis points with no rate heights expect -- with no rate hikes expected until at least 2023. Meanwhile, long end rates also fell from about the 2.9% level at the time we gave the targets to just -- to average just 90 basis points during 2020. All told, we estimate that the sharply lower rate environments since 4Q '18 has impacted our 4Q '20 pre-tax margin by about 5 percentage points in ROE by around 2.5 percentage points. We also witnessed a large downdraft in global equity markets in late 2018, followed by a steady rebound in the U.S equity markets, but international equity market averages over the last 2 years were down. While we are clearly operating in a dramatically different environment relative to when we set our targets, we have made real progress. We went from a 3% decline in fee revenue in 2019 to a 4% growth in fee revenue by reversing the trajectory of our servicing fees and delivering in our global markets business. We are evolving our business model to become an enterprise outsource provider while at the same time enhancing our investment service and capabilities and client coverage distinguishing us from our competitors. We've also systematically reduced net expenses ex notable items, which has helped -- help us begin to close the margin gap to our peers by about 2 percentage points. We remain confident in our ability to deliver ongoing strong expense results. In summary, though interest rates have impacted the timing of our medium term targets, I'm confident in the direction of our business and we will continue to innovate to meet our clients' needs and drive business growth, while also focusing on improving productivity to achieve our goals. And with that operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlexander Blostein: Great, thank you. Good morning, everybody. So first, Eric, for you, maybe just to clarify some of the comments you made around servicing fees. So you talked about $1.5 trillion in sort of annual client attrition. Is that a -- that's about 4%, I think of your AUC. Is that sort of what we should be thinking about as kind of like a gross impact on revenues as well? And qualitatively, how does that compare to prior periods? Has anything changed that sort of drives this churn higher?\nEric Aboaf: Alex, it's Eric. Thanks for the question. We're trying to be real clear about our sales expectations for our business, because at the end of the day that is part of what we do every day and we do it across segments, across regions, across client groups. And I think to kind of give you some perspective on that, we wanted to be clear that to actually have to demonstrate net new business, right, so to be able to offset the nominal amount of attrition that we always get, which is a few percentage points and actually overcome that plus deliver some amount of net new business growth, we need about $1.5 trillion of gross new sales a year to accomplish that, and we think that's what would really contribute to the rebound of growth that we'd like to see. Now, in truth, we've not gotten there this year. This year, net new business was flat, and you saw our AUC/A wins at about $800 billion. And so, it's just obviously an area of pretty intense focus, but I think it's the kind of area that we feel like we can make a dent on. If you step back, we've made really good progress on our top 50 clients where our -- where we rolled out our coverage process and set of executives about 2 years ago, and we've seen the growth there. We've seen it in a couple of segments, and now we need to broaden that and deepen that kind of coverage intensity across the rest of franchise.\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes, Alex, I'd like to just add to that. I would not want to leave you with the impression that there's a client retention problem here, if anything, client retention has gone up. But if you think about things like what the market is facing in terms of reduction in funds, for example, or if you think about M&A, oftentimes represents an opportunity for us. So, there's a small amount of attrition broadly defined as much asset attrition as it is client attrition. And what we're trying to be here is very clear on how we think about our -- what we need to do from a sales perspective and what we're doing about it.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Thank you. That clears it up a bit. Speaking of M&A, Ron, I wanted to ask you a question around SSGA. Obviously, there's been several headlines around potential strategic actions State Street could make around its asset management business. And in the past, you also talked about the drive for scale in that business, just like what you're trying to provide to your clients. So maybe you can update us on your latest kind of strategic thinking for SSGA when it comes to either acquisitions or divestitures, obviously there was a JV headline out there as well. And as you think about sort of these various avenues, what is the ultimate kind of financial and strategic goal you're trying to achieve for State Street as a whole when it comes to SSGA? Thank you.\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes, Alex, I'm not going to comment on market rumors, but what I'm going to say is what I've said before. We have a very strong franchise in SSGA. It's particularly strong in the ETF space, the cash space, the indexing space. It’s got an increasingly strong position in ESG. Having said that, as we've said before, we see the world evolving. And therefore we need to think about how to add capabilities, both product and distribution capabilities, or distribution access to this. So we are -- it's not new. Any time you ask us about this, I think I answered it more or less the same way that we're constantly thinking about this. We've made some steps over the past several years in terms of organically adding really important product capability, for example, fixed income ETFs, ESG capabilities, we launched the low-cost range of funds, we created the distribution arrangement to help propel those low-cost funds. So, we will continue to look at those things, and we'll continue to look at inorganic activities, if we think it's the best outcome. And to answer the last part of your question, what we're looking to do is to best position SSGA for growth. It’s a to remarkable asset. It's got a lot of potential, and we'll do what we need to do to best position it for growth.\nAlexander Blostein: Yes, for sure. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKenneth Usdin: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey Eric, just a follow-on on the NII side. Just wondering if you could help us understand you talked about some type of step off from fourth to first in terms of NII and then stabilization. And I'm just wondering if you can walk us through the pieces of what are still moving through other than day count in the first quarter. And how much premium AUM was in the quarter, and is that part of a rate of change that you can see any type of -- help that stabilization or benefit thereafter? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Ken. It's Eric. Sure. Let me describe first maybe third quarter to the fourth quarter to give you some context, and then fourth quarter to first quarter and then kind of see what we see from there. Going into the fourth quarter, we have the usual headwinds from investment -- from the investment portfolio and actually higher premium amortization than we've had previously, and that would cost us sequentially about $35 million. That's kind of the headwind. Now, that will come back to, because that headwind is attenuating each quarter, but that was a headwind. Against that headwind in the fourth quarter, we had some unusual benefits. We had the FX swap mark-to-market, which was about $5. We had a surge in deposits, both in developed markets and in emerging markets. Remember, they're valuable in emerging markets worth about $10 as a tailwind. And then we built our investment portfolio and added quite a bit of loans at the tune of about $20 million. Now, that was a larger bill than usual, but a better remunerated plan. And so, those are the kind of features that held us flat in effect from 3Q to 4Q. I think if we go into first quarter, you kind of take each of those in pieces, the investment portfolio, headwind, it's probably going to be about $25 million instead of $35 million. So you see it attenuate. And part of that is that the prepayment speeds are neutral we think from 4Q to 1Q. We have some tailwinds of deposits and loans and investments, but that's probably worth about 10 bucks. And then we still have a couple headwinds, we have the unwind of the swap mark-to-market which sequentially is worth 10, because you got to double up the positive turns negative. And then you have day count worth another 10 as a headwind. So that's kind of what gets us to the guide that we gave. Once we get through the first quarter, I think what we expect to see is that stabilization and what we're effectively expecting is that the investment portfolio headwind which was $35 million, but coming $25 million, it's going to start to trend down to $10 million a quarter. And why is that partly rates have been kind of working through the on the yield side and partly because prepayment speeds we expect to start to attenuate as we see higher rates. And so, we do expect some lesser headwinds. And against that, we think that the actions that we take on a more traditional basis will be worth about plus 10. And so it will be roughly neutral and stable from 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q and so forth. Obviously, it'll be range bound. And obviously, it'll be -- there's always a little bit of lumpiness that we get into, but that's our best estimate of what we're seeing today, based on the curves, the expectations of rates and so forth.\nKenneth Usdin: So Eric, sorry, if I can speak that back at you is that mean kind of a 50 something million dollar decline for the first, if I got all your add up there? 10, 25 and 10 and 10, and 10? Just trying to understand what that all gets to?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, I think I said 6% to 8%. So I think we're looking at …\nKenneth Usdin: Okay.\nEric Aboaf: … whatever $35 million decline in the first quarter and then stable from there.\nKenneth Usdin: Okay, sorry. Got it. Understood. All right. Great. Thank you. And then just one follow-up on a big picture, unfortunate another news item to ask you about. Yes, we're going on. Now, I guess 9 months since the BlackRock ETF headline news was out there as well and I know it's a specific client, but if there's a way of just helping us understand just what needs to happen for that to either be codified as you're keeping it or going away. Just any commentary would be helpful. Thank you.\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes, that process is still underway. We're working very closely with them. They have not made any decisions at this, but we are feeling reasonably positive about them.\nEric Aboaf: And Ken, it's Eric. I also just remind you though, that is a growing -- it's a growing business, a growing asset at quite a high pace, right. And so I think the last time we had one of these, it took 3 years from start to finish to kind of work out from discussion to RFP to response and so forth. And so I think there's [indiscernible] factor that into the -- to any scenarios that you run.\nKenneth Usdin: Yes. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good morning. This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just wanted to focus in a little bit on some of the softness you mentioned in the U.S and EMEA mid market phase. I’m wondering if you could help us maybe size that a little bit, recognizing your efforts to broaden and diversify the business, just in terms of the core of what you've got right now. Either maybe size it or talk about the impact that had on your '21 guide. And also interested in any interaction with the activities of the pricing committee there in terms of either structuring pricing, or what have you in order to better retain or win business. Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Sure, Adam. It's Eric. Let me start. I think the way we think about our business on the servicing side is across segments, right. We have asset managers, we have asset owners, we have insurers, and our business is more geared to asset managers in the other segments. And so, we've historically built our franchise there, but we've actually done quite a bit of success in other -- in those other segments as well. Within asset managers, what we're starting to find is over the last year, last 2 years, the last year, in particular, we've actually secured more growth than the largest of the asset managers. They're obviously winning when you look at the external data, and either less growth or in some places decline in the mid size and smaller asset managers. And so what -- and that gap can be -- that gap in a particular quarter or a year could be a 2 percentage point growth gap, it could be a 3 or 4 percentage point growth gap, it bounces around. And so what we're finding is that, we really feel like we have the right coverage and intensity and kind of seniority focused on the largest of our clients. But our midsize clients are really an important part of our franchise. We built our franchise on them, we provide really, I think outstanding products and capabilities. And we're finding we need to spend both senior time on the midsize clients as well as the time of our relationship managers and client executives. And so this is really about intensifying our coverage of those groups, and helping them see the strength and the opportunities and the products and services that we can offer. And make sure we're top of mind that we're building on share of wallet. I've got share of wallet statistics for top 250 clients, and that includes the midsized players and really executing in that area day in, day out product one, product two, product 30, product 50, it's literally down at that level of granularity where we're focused now.\nAdam Beatty: Excellent. That's helpful in the dynamics. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on MBS prepays. I appreciate the detail from before on that. Recognizing, of course, that interest rates will be the main driver there. Do you feel as though this past year 2020 there was any type of pull forward, in prepayments or refinancing, such that a reversal and downward ticking rates might not generate the same level of prepays as previously? Or is it very much still linked to rates? Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Adam, it's Eric. I always like to hope that prepayments are burning through that there's been a one-time pop and then they're going to attenuate, but I've learned that hoping isn't a strategy, right. We just have to operate through the environment. I think what we've seen is certainly a surge of prepayments, starting in the end of 2Q, right, once people figured out how to do the paperwork during COVID in 3Q and 4Q. And our best estimate is informed by the various modeling providers. We subscribe to 3 or 4 of them, because we knew that diversity of opinion suggests that prepayment speeds should probably continue into the first quarter, and then I'll begin to edge down from there in the second quarter and the third quarter, with some stepwise improvement. That said, we've got -- I think we've got to live through time here and just see how it plays out and we'll know more. What we're trying to do, though, is make sure that we're always taking the actions that we can on investment portfolio, on deposit reinvestment, on loans, because that's something we can control and we need to stay focused on those actions.\nAdam Beatty: Fair enough. Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRyan Kenny: Hi. This is Ryan Kenny on behalf of Betsy. Good morning.\nRonald O’Hanley: Good morning.\nRyan Kenny: So we saw the OCC stablecoin approval come through earlier this month. Just wondering if that has any impact on State Street, and how you're thinking about your blockchain strategy going forward?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes. Hi. This is Ron. In terms of direct impact, first, the OCC doesn't regulate us. And secondly, it directly impacts or, if you will, poses the most challenge to the payments banks. For us, in general, it's probably neutral to positive because anything that stimulates more interest in blockchain and particularly more interested in digital currency is going to create a custody opportunity for us. And we have been investing fairly significantly in that space, as we've said in the past of blockchain itself is actually quite an important part of lots of things that we're doing in custody and asset servicing, and increasingly, we see digital coins, did cryptocurrency as part of holdings within our client base and we'll continue to invest in that. But the OCC's work itself, I would say, not directly relevant to us at this time.\nRyan Kenny: Thanks. And then one quick other question. Wondering how we should think about the impact from money market fee waivers in 2021? Is it in the run rate now? Or should we expect any upset from here? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Ryan, its Eric. Good part of it is in the runway run rate I think we said about $3 million in 4Q. We do expect it to tick up one more step and we fix, we're now expecting about $5 million to $10 million a quarter in the coming years. So I think we're much less exposed than others. We don't have retail money market funds. We don't have high net worth funds with higher fees. So -- but those are the figures.\nRyan Kenny: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Good morning, folks. Eric, maybe just to continue along the net interest income guide for '21. Just if you can just talk about your earning asset assumptions for the year and deposit growth strategy realized and obviously, they spiked up in 4Q. But as you -- you're building your servicing business and you're trying to enhance some of the deposit strategies. Maybe if you can talk about that and your assumptions for '21? And then in fact, also on the premium amortization, I think the $35 million from 3Q to 4Q, is that about a $170 million leverage? I just want to [indiscernible].\nEric Aboaf: Brian, it's Eric. Let me do those in reverse order. I think the -- what the $35 million was the headwind we're seeing on a quarterly basis from 4Q to -- from 3Q to 4Q in the investment portfolio. That was a combination of the investment yield grind down and actually higher premium amortization because we're still living through that wave. What I then said is that 4Q to 1Q, we thought the combination of the investment portfolio headwind including premium amortization would be about a $25 million headwind. And then I said starting in second quarter, we thought it would trend down even further to closer to $10 million -- $15 million and $10 million in those out quarters each quarter. So I think what we're starting to see is an attenuation or have that expectation, which partly is the kind of tractor of the investment portfolio playing through and partly lower levels of premium amortization expected as speeds begin to edge downwards. In terms of the deposit forecast and the earning asset strategy, deposits, it's really hard to gauge. The Fed continues to expand the money supply by what about $120 billion a month, we are at 1% or 2% of the deposits. So we pick up deposits just by being here every month. So there's some amount of tailwind. It's just really hard to read, given lots of talk about stimulus bills, asset allocation and reallocation from risk to -- risk on risk off to bar belling. So I think, right now, we're assuming that we're going to at least stay at these fourth quarter level of average deposits, with probably a little bit of edging up. And so we're not yet -- we're not at this point of expecting yet another surge, but you just don't know, and I think we'll obviously respond, and that happens. In terms of asset strategy, that's a tough one. I think it's tough for us and for every other bank, because we can certainly take some risks on the curve, but you don't get paid very much for it. And so, I think there's a balance that we're making, which is how much dry powder you want to keep. And so then when you do see a spike of interest rates, you can add your leg into that at a higher and better return versus forsaking some income in the short-term. And we’re -- our investors are always kind of carefully picky about that, trying to be opportunistic and will come and go. And we'll do that in treasuries around the curve. MBS you've seen us build up. Our MBS book over the last year by a solid $10 billion. I think we want to just be careful there. We want to -- we prefer some of the prepayment protected sub-segments. We've done a little bit of credit. We want to be careful there too, because credit isn't -- is impacted during the CCAR and SCB process. So it's a pretty diversified approach. I think it's the core of our strategy, looking for opportunities. And I think as we see some of those will act, and we'll certainly report on them to all of you.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. That's great color. Thank you. And then on the -- just back to the $1.5 trillion that you mentioned of growth service, you went to offset some of the headwinds. Can you just talk about the cross-sell portion of that. So this would be adding different new services to existing clients. Maybe how that sort of tracking within that outlook, and then also the importance of SSGA's indexing business as a cross-sell to asset servicing clients.\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes, Brian, it's Ron. Cross-sell is a very big piece of this. I mean, if you think about what Eric said earlier, look at 2020 performance, it was largely the same in 2019. The fastest growing segment, or the segments that accounted for the most growth was in fact our global client division, which is our largest client. So by definition, we weren't adding many to that, if any, but what we were doing was growing substantially in there. And that will be a key part of our growth going forward, for both traditional asset servicing products, as some of these providers continue to consolidate -- some of these institutions continue to consolidate providers, but also for front to back Alpha activities as we install either fully install Alpha or even put Charles River in a situation where we have the middle in the back office, but not the front. So that's a key part of it. As we think about the numbers, certainly the ability to have common clients where we're both the asset servicer and the indexer is attractive, we always look for those opportunities. That that's not in the assumption that Eric's describing there. So what we really were trying to do here, in response to many questions we've gotten is more or less dimension, what we need to do to grow revenue, it's obviously that number. It's based on averages. So to the extent to which, in a given year or given quarter, we're bringing in higher fee kinds of assets, then obviously, the 9.5 goes down. So that's the way to think about it. You can never at the end of any particular quarter say, well, if you're not a quarter of the way there you -- are you making it or not, you got to go one click down and say what was the nature of the kind of underlying business which you'll be able to understand from us.\nBrian Bedell: Okay, great. That’s helpful. Thank you.\nRonald O’Hanley: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Wildhack: Good morning, guys.\nRonald O’Hanley: Hi, Rob.\nRobert Wildhack: You called out some reduced client activity is pressuring servicing fees in the fourth quarter. Just wondering how that played out with respect to expectations. And then more qualitatively, the level of client activity, you're thinking about? Is it the outlook for next year or this year, 2021?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, Rob. It's Eric. There are a number of features in how we quantify the growth kind of headwinds, tailwinds of our servicing business. Client activity is one of those that fluctuates and really represents some of the trading volumes of our clients, because there's some tolling that we do for that, in particular, cash and derivative trades tend to have more likely have tolls than others just because they're a little more complicated, ETF creation, redeem that kind of stuff. So it's a part of our fee schedules that we try to quantify, but it has a long list of kind of volumetric elements. I think on a year-on-year basis, 4Q '20 versus a year ago, the -- that -- those some of the client activity volumes actually trended down. So servicing fees, it was worth about a percentage point of servicing fee headwinds. That's an example of a time it hits against us. For full year 2020, it was actually a positive of almost 2 percentage points. So we saw that as a tailwind. And obviously, the -- all the activity in first quarter, second quarter, in particular, was helpful. Next year, we're going to have to lap ourselves on that. So it'll probably be a 1%. headwind. So it's got that kind of effect. And what it does is it reminds us that everything matters in our business to drive growth, right. If there's an equity market, tailwind or headwind that matters. This client activity matters, as well net new business, right, and [indiscernible] I referenced kind of the importance of gross new sales matters, and then there's always the normalized fee headwinds. And the good news on that last one is that those have normalized back to something pretty close to historical levels.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay, thanks. And I wanted to also ask about the business that you're forming with Microsoft, IHS, PIMCO and others. Can you give us some more detail on the structure there? What products and services you'll be contributing and how the potential offering there will compare to your standalone offering today?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes, Rob, it's early days you're referring to hub. And it's early days there in terms of what's going to happen. And our view was that given the role that we play as a custodian as well as our own Alpha product, that this was a good initiative to hang around, if you will. We also have clients that are part of it, but it's just very early days in terms of how that's going to develop its initial focus is on data and data usage and helping firms kind of managing employee data in a more efficient way. But, again, it's so early on, there's really not much to report.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay. No problem. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Eric Aboaf for closing remarks.\nRonald O’Hanley: It's Ron. I'll take it. Thank you everybody for your time and attention and we look forward to following up with you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ronald O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to reflect on how State Street successfully adapted to the unique operating environment in 2020, supporting our clients, communities, and the financial system, all while advancing and positioning the business for future success. 2020 was a year like no other in recent memory. As we entered the year, few could have predicted how volatile the operating market -- operating environment would be as the health crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global economic recession, which the world is still dealing with. Against that backdrop, governments, central banks, and financial institutions like State Street needed to act quickly to assist in limiting the impact of this crisis on the financial markets and the global economy. 2020 also highlighted a number of racial and social injustices that we must act to address. When faced with these economic and social challenges, I'm proud of how State Street team members around the world lived our values of being stronger together and a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities, all while generating solid earnings growth for our shareholders in 2020. As the pandemic worsened last year, our global operating capabilities allowed us to adapt quickly and deliver products, services, and results for our clients when they needed us most. In addition to the client-focused product and service enhancements we made in 2020, we continued to transform our operating model by simplifying our operations, increasing automation, and driving productivity and efficiencies while continuing to invest in our business. State Street has been on a journey to transform its operating model for the last two years, and we expect that we'll be able to deliver further improvements during 2021 to drive costs lower, self fund investments for the future, and transform how we compete and operate in the years ahead. At the same time, the volatility in markets demonstrated the strength of our global FX franchise, where we retain the number one market share position with asset managers and achieved an approximately 30% uptick in revenue. We continued our intense efforts to innovate throughout 2020 with the further development and delivery of the State Street Alpha front to back platform, which has gained traction with clients. Through the open architecture nature of the platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships with leading data and analytics providers unlocking new sources of revenue. We signed six Alpha clients in 2020 where early adoption has helped us accelerate our development. The Alpha pipeline remains strong. While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our future strategy, we also remained laser focused on improving the financial performance within investment servicing, which is the core engine of our business. We recently enhanced our institutional services client facing strategy, and during 2021 we will leverage improvements in client coverage, segments, and regions to broaden and drive investment servicing revenue growth over time. As a result, our strategic moves, the strength of our capabilities and operating model, and the commitment of our team members enabled successful navigation of 2020 and improved year-over-year financial performance, which I will now discuss further. Turning to Slide 3, fourth quarter EPS was $1.39 or $1.69 excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago period, fourth quarter total revenue declined 4% largely driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, fee revenue increased 2%, reversing recent trends and demonstrating an improved servicing and management fee performance, as well as strong FX trading results. Despite an increase in transaction processing, total expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items. At the end of the fourth quarter, AUC/A and AUM both increased to record levels supported by higher period-end markets. At Global Advisors, we had another strong performance in ETFs and cash. These results in both businesses provide good step-off points for 2021. Turning to our full year 2020 results, we made solid financial progress relative to 2019 as we work to drive fee revenue growth higher and total expenses lower. Full year EPS was $6.32 or $6.70 excluding notable items. EPS results were up 17% and 9% excluding notable items, despite the dramatically lower interest rate environment. Supported by year-over-year improvements in servicing and management fees, very strong FX trading results, and a higher revenue contribution from CRD which continues to perform well, total fee revenue increased 4%. However, total revenue was roughly flat year-over-year as a result of the impact of interest rate headwinds on NII. Our team drove total expenses down 1.5% year-over-year, excluding notable items as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense reduction that we successfully established in 2019. Operating leverage was positive, and margin was up in one of the most challenging years in history. To conclude my opening remarks, State Street faced a number of unprecedented challenges during 2020. As a result of our operational capabilities and innovation, we were able to successfully navigate those challenges all the while acting as a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities and generating solid year-over-year earnings growth for our shareholders. As we look ahead, for the first quarter of 2021, our Board has authorized up to $475 million of common stock repurchases, which is in effect the limit set by the Fed. We are well positioned for and looking forward to returning significantly more capital to shareholders in the future. In addition, the Board has also authorized the partial redemption of our Series F preferred stock, which will further benefit our common shareholders following its partial redemption in the first quarter. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail, and then I will return to update you on our medium-term targets. Thank you, Eric. Turning to slide 15. I would like to update you on the current thinking on our medium term targets, which we now aim to achieve by the end of 2023 on a run rate basis for 2024. At this time, we still consider these target levels to be the right ones for our business and our shareholders. As a result, they remained unchanged as you can see from the slide. However, we now expect these targets may take longer to achieve than we had initially anticipated, largely as a result of exogenous factors. We set these medium term targets in early December 2018. Soon thereafter, interest rates fell as the Fed tried to stimulate a slowing economy in 2019 and then again as COVID hit in 2020. The market went from expecting in 2018, the Fed to approach 3% by late 2019, to ending 2020 at 25 basis points with no rate heights expect -- with no rate hikes expected until at least 2023. Meanwhile, long end rates also fell from about the 2.9% level at the time we gave the targets to just -- to average just 90 basis points during 2020. All told, we estimate that the sharply lower rate environments since 4Q '18 has impacted our 4Q '20 pre-tax margin by about 5 percentage points in ROE by around 2.5 percentage points. We also witnessed a large downdraft in global equity markets in late 2018, followed by a steady rebound in the U.S equity markets, but international equity market averages over the last 2 years were down. While we are clearly operating in a dramatically different environment relative to when we set our targets, we have made real progress. We went from a 3% decline in fee revenue in 2019 to a 4% growth in fee revenue by reversing the trajectory of our servicing fees and delivering in our global markets business. We are evolving our business model to become an enterprise outsource provider while at the same time enhancing our investment service and capabilities and client coverage distinguishing us from our competitors. We've also systematically reduced net expenses ex notable items, which has helped -- help us begin to close the margin gap to our peers by about 2 percentage points. We remain confident in our ability to deliver ongoing strong expense results. In summary, though interest rates have impacted the timing of our medium term targets, I'm confident in the direction of our business and we will continue to innovate to meet our clients' needs and drive business growth, while also focusing on improving productivity to achieve our goals. And with that operator, we can now open the call for questions. Yes, Alex, I'd like to just add to that. I would not want to leave you with the impression that there's a client retention problem here, if anything, client retention has gone up. But if you think about things like what the market is facing in terms of reduction in funds, for example, or if you think about M&A, oftentimes represents an opportunity for us. So, there's a small amount of attrition broadly defined as much asset attrition as it is client attrition. And what we're trying to be here is very clear on how we think about our -- what we need to do from a sales perspective and what we're doing about it. Yes, Alex, I'm not going to comment on market rumors, but what I'm going to say is what I've said before. We have a very strong franchise in SSGA. It's particularly strong in the ETF space, the cash space, the indexing space. It's got an increasingly strong position in ESG. Having said that, as we've said before, we see the world evolving. And therefore we need to think about how to add capabilities, both product and distribution capabilities, or distribution access to this. So we are -- it's not new. Any time you ask us about this, I think I answered it more or less the same way that we're constantly thinking about this. We've made some steps over the past several years in terms of organically adding really important product capability, for example, fixed income ETFs, ESG capabilities, we launched the low-cost range of funds, we created the distribution arrangement to help propel those low-cost funds. So, we will continue to look at those things, and we'll continue to look at inorganic activities, if we think it's the best outcome. And to answer the last part of your question, what we're looking to do is to best position SSGA for growth. It's a to remarkable asset. It's got a lot of potential, and we'll do what we need to do to best position it for growth. Yes, that process is still underway. We're working very closely with them. They have not made any decisions at this, but we are feeling reasonably positive about them. Good morning. Yes. Hi. This is Ron. In terms of direct impact, first, the OCC doesn't regulate us. And secondly, it directly impacts or, if you will, poses the most challenge to the payments banks. For us, in general, it's probably neutral to positive because anything that stimulates more interest in blockchain and particularly more interested in digital currency is going to create a custody opportunity for us. And we have been investing fairly significantly in that space, as we've said in the past of blockchain itself is actually quite an important part of lots of things that we're doing in custody and asset servicing, and increasingly, we see digital coins, did cryptocurrency as part of holdings within our client base and we'll continue to invest in that. But the OCC's work itself, I would say, not directly relevant to us at this time. Yes, Brian, it's Ron. Cross-sell is a very big piece of this.

            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 4, and before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, let me briefly outline $145 million of notable items we recognized in the fourth quarter, which totaled $0.30 of EPS that will collectively help us deliver another year of declining expenses in 2021. First, we took an employee severance charge of $82 million to eliminate approximately 1,200 positions, mostly in middle management, which will be partially offset by in-sourcing and critical hires during the year. This complements the senior management reductions we made 2 years ago and the ongoing reduction of junior roles through automation that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this to generate savings of approximately $120 million in 2021 and about twice that in the following year. Second, we took a $51 million occupancy charge for real estate to reduce our total office space across 20 sites by about 1 million square feet or approximately 13% of our total square footage. This is the start of our process of reconfiguring our office space for a post-COVID environment. We expect this action to generate savings of roughly $30 million in 2021. We try to minimize repositioning charges, but we have delivered 2 years in a row of underlying expense reduction while investing in our business and want to do so again in 2021. Turning to Slide 5, I will begin my review of both our 4Q '20 and full year 2020 results. As you can see on the top left of the table, we finished fourth quarter with strong revenues. Total fee revenue increased 2% year-on-year and was up 5% quarter-on-quarter. And while interest rate environment continues to be a headwind, the absence of the $20 million in the third quarter true-up combined with a stronger than expected balance sheet growth led to a 4% quarter-on-quarter improvement in NII. Total expenses ex notables were flat year-on-year, but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter including currency translation and higher variable costs. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2020 performance. And despite the challenging operating environment, dramatically lower interest rates and a suspension by banks, we delivered full year positive operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin and EPS growth rate of 9% excluding notable items. Our GAAP results were even better across the board. Turning to Slide 6, period end AUC/A increased 13% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $38.8 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client flows and net new business installations. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of higher period end market levels and better clients flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 11% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter to $3.5 trillion. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net ETF and cash inflows, but offset by continued institutional outflows in the equity index product line. Our SPDR ETF business recorded its second highest quarter of net inflows driven by strong U.S and European flows, taking total net ETF inflows to over $43 billion for the full-year, almost 30% higher than last year. Now on to Slide 7. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased 1% year-on-year including currency translation. The increase reflects higher average market levels, softer than expected sales in 2020, as well as lower levels of client activity and normal pricing headwinds. Servicing fees were flat quarter-on-quarter including currency translation has higher average market levels were partially offset by a continued normalization of client activity. On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators for our servicing business. AUC/A wins totaled $205 billion, while AUC/A yet to be installed amounted to $436 billion in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead, we are focused on generating the level of gross sales volume needed to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, which we think is about $1.5 trillion or more of net AUC/A each year. The amount of gross wins needs -- needed to offset these factors will vary year-to-year and be impacted by a number of factors including product mix. This would include Alpha mandates, which were over 25% of our second half AUC/A wins. So as I have mentioned before the sales cycle and inflation of these more complex solution focused services take some time. In 2020, we've had some strong success and growth across our top 50 asset manager clients, as well as within our insurance and asset owner client segments. We have been disappointed, however, with our sales to our mid size asset managers in North America and EMEA and are implementing a plan to address these areas of opportunity. On the bottom right panel, we highlight some of these tactical enhancements to our institutional services strategy, which involves expanding coverage to a total of our top 350 clients and diversifying our pipeline across segments and geographies. Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Before I began, you will notice that for the current and prior periods, we have reclassified the AUM base fees that Global Advisors receives for acting as the marketing agent for the SPDR Gold ETF from FX trading services into the management fee line. Going forward, we think this reclass better reflects the management fee performance at Global Advisors. Inclusive of this reclass, fourth quarter management fees reached $493 million, up 3% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, including the impact of currency translation. Year-on-year, management fees benefited from higher average market rates and the strong ETF inflows I mentioned earlier, partially offset by money market fee waivers of about $3 million, net institutional outflows and the timing of cash outflows. Our fourth quarter investment management pre-tax margin reached 32%, which you can see in our segment reporting in our financial addendum, and we generated significant positive operating leverage. Regarding money market fee waivers, we currently expect they will continue at the current rate of $5 million to $10 million per quarter company-wide in 2021, which is included in our outlook that I will discuss further shortly. FX trading services had another strong quarter. Fourth quarter FX revenue increased 25% year-on-year and was up 20% quarter-on-quarter, demonstrating the strength of our top ranked FX franchise for asset managers. Year-on-year and sequentially, FX revenue benefited from substantially higher indirect FX volumes as well as stronger market making revenue on elevated volatility as we help clients rebalance their global portfolios in the light of ever changing economic and political conditions. The full year 2020 FX revenue surged approximately 30%, will obviously make the 2021 year-on-year comparisons more difficult. Fourth quarter securities finance revenue fell 21% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower enhanced custody balances and agency spreads. Securities finance revenue increased 5% quarter-on-quarter, however, mainly as a result of both higher agency lending assets and higher enhanced custody balances as we saw demand for some leverage reemerge. Finally, fourth quarter software and processing fees were down 7% year-on-year due to lower on-prem CRD revenue. Software and processing fees increased 19% quarter-on-quarter as a result of sequentially stronger CRD revenue and positive market related adjustments. Moving to Slide 9, we show CRD revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated CRD revenues into its three categories, given the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the ASC 606 revenue recognition accounting standard for on- revenues in particular. Fourth quarter CRD revenue fell 9% year-on-year, largely as a result of the timing of revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2019, but was up strongly at 16% quarter-on-quarter on higher renewals. CRD demonstrated very strong revenue growth for the full year, driven in part by the success of the CRD wealth strategy earlier in the year, with total standalone CRD revenues up 14% year-on-year and with the more durable SaaS and professional services revenues growing 18% relative to full year 2019. On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the highlights of the State Street Alpha front to back platform sales during 2020. In total, we signed six Alpha clients during the year including three in 4Q, which included one new client and two clients converted from existing relationships. The Alpha pipeline remains promising as clients begin to realize the transformation of potential of the platform for their technology and portfolio management needs. Turning to Slide 10. Fourth quarter NII declined 22% year-on-year, but was up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The quarter-on-quarter increase in NII was driven by the absence of the $20 million true-up in the third quarter. Not including that true-up, the significant investment portfolio balance growth and higher average loans, coupled with a $17 billion of higher average deposits, which were worth about $10 million, and approximately $5 million of episodic FX mark-to-market swap benefits over quarter end were enough to offset the ongoing headwinds of the low interest rate environment on investment portfolio yields. Each quarter, we try to offset the persistent effect of low rates in the portfolio by taking these sorts of tactical actions. In some quarters, we'll be able to fully offset the headwind like we did here, as we put the $17 billion of the deposit surge to work, but that won't be the case every time. On the right side of the slide, we show our end of period and average balance sheet highlights. Last quarter I noted how we expect to operate around $190 billion of average deposits, but that our deposit levels might increase given the Fed's continued expansion of the money supply. As it turns out, we begin -- begun to see the tailwind and now expect to operate at even higher levels of client deposit and more in line with our fourth quarter average or even higher. We will be opportunistic from here regarding the deployment of cash and the expansion of our investment portfolio. But we also need to be mindful of currently tight credit spreads and the potential for OCI risk from interest rate changes. On Slide 11, we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex notables, so that the underlying trends are readily visible. 4Q '20 expenses were held flat year-on-year, but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter, excluding notable items and including the impact of currency translation, which was worth about a point in the fourth quarter. Relative to the third quarter and ex notables, we achieved a decline in the largest expense segment of comp and benefits, while occupancy and information systems costs were held flat. However, this was more than offset by higher transactional processing and other expenses in the fourth quarter. Transaction processing increased 10% quarter-on-quarter as a result of variable costs tied to higher market data volumes, sub custody balances and brokerage volumes. Other expenses rose 8% quarter-on-quarter as a result of higher marketing and professional fees. For the full year total expenses were down approximately 1.5% ex notables relative to 2019, demonstrating the solid progress we are making in improving our operating model as we continue to reduce expenses, sell fund investments in our business and more than offset natural expense growth. We want to be down again in 2021, which I will detail shortly. Moving to Slide 12. On the left of the slide, we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio in 2020 as we supported clients with the MMLF and we've thoughtfully put higher levels of client deposits to work to support NII. On the right of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, as you can see, we continue to navigate this challenging operating environment with extremely strong and elevated capital levels relative to our regulatory requirements. As Ron noted, we are excited that our Board authorized the new common share repurchase program for the first quarter, up to $425 million and which is in line with the new Fed limits. We're also optimizing the capital stack by redeeming $500 million of pref stock, which will have a benefit to our common stockholders starting in 2Q. Turning to Slide 13, you could see a summary of our 4Q '20 and full year 2020 results. I've already covered fourth quarter in detail. So let me say a few words about our full year results, given that we've been on a journey to turn around growth and improve margins and returns. Following a 3% decline in total fee revenues in full year 2019, we successfully drove a 4% increase in total fee revenue growth in full year 2020. Many initiatives came together to successfully make this happen. Following a 6% decline in servicing fees in full year 2019, we intervened to moderate pricing pressure, we revamped our coverage of our top 50 clients and we executed on our Alpha strategy leading to an increase in servicing fees by 2% year-on-year, which made for a real turnaround. At Global Advisors, despite a challenging year on our long-term institutional index product line, our ETF business had a very strong year with total flows up 30% year-on-year and our cash business performing quite well. Our FX trading services business had a remarkable year in 2020, as a result of higher market volatility and record client volumes, and we reap the benefit of our prior investments and our number one position with asset managers. On expenses for the full year, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive costs out of the business recording a second consecutive year of total net expense reduction, excluding notable items and adjusting for the acquisition of CRD, all the while investing in our products and capabilities. All told, excluding notable items, State Street delivered full year operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin and EPS growth of 9%, notwithstanding some of the interest rate headwinds. And GAAP results were even stronger across the board. All that said, we have more to do in 2021. So let me get into it. Turning to Slide 14, let me cover our full year 2020 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter of 2021. As I usually do, let me first share some of the assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, our rate outlook assumes that short end rates remain relatively flat, and there is some modest steepening to the yield curve in line with the current forwards and anticipates modestly slowing prepayment speeds. We're also assuming around 7 to 8 percentage point to point growth from equity markets in 2021, as well as normalized market volatility, which impacts our trading businesses. So beginning with revenue, we currently expect that fee revenue will be flat to up 2% for 2021. And fee revenue ex trading will be up 3% to 5%. This includes servicing fees growing towards the top end of the 3% to 5% range. Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect fee revenue to be down year-over-year by low single digits perhaps down to the 4%, given headwinds such as the outsized FX trading revenues we saw last year due to volatility in the early days of the pandemic in March. Regarding NII, we expect full year 2021 NII to be down 14% to 17% on a year-over-year basis, as investment portfolio yields continue to grind lower from prepayments and reinvestments. Regarding first quarter of 2021, we expect NII to be down about 68% sequentially, driven by the continued impact of lower rates and day count and should stabilize there and be somewhat range bound, assuming that our rate assumptions do not change significantly. Turning to expenses as you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex notables will be flat to down 1% on a nominal basis in 2021 due to our continued focus on resource and infrastructure optimization, and currently assume that currency translation will be a 1% headwind in this estimate. This net expense reduction includes approximately 4% to 5% of variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like CRD, Alpha and tech infrastructure and automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect expenses to be largely in line with this guide year-over-year and consistent with the seasonal expenses usually occurring in the first quarter. We also expect releases of provisions for credit losses during 2021 of at least a third of what was built in 2020. Taxes should be in the 17% to 19% range for 2021. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Alex, it's Eric. Thanks for the question. We're trying to be real clear about our sales expectations for our business, because at the end of the day that is part of what we do every day and we do it across segments, across regions, across client groups. And I think to kind of give you some perspective on that, we wanted to be clear that to actually have to demonstrate net new business, right, so to be able to offset the nominal amount of attrition that we always get, which is a few percentage points and actually overcome that plus deliver some amount of net new business growth, we need about $1.5 trillion of gross new sales a year to accomplish that, and we think that's what would really contribute to the rebound of growth that we'd like to see. Now, in truth, we've not gotten there this year. This year, net new business was flat, and you saw our AUC/A wins at about $800 billion. And so, it's just obviously an area of pretty intense focus, but I think it's the kind of area that we feel like we can make a dent on. If you step back, we've made really good progress on our top 50 clients where our -- where we rolled out our coverage process and set of executives about 2 years ago, and we've seen the growth there. We've seen it in a couple of segments, and now we need to broaden that and deepen that kind of coverage intensity across the rest of franchise. Ken. It's Eric. Sure. Let me describe first maybe third quarter to the fourth quarter to give you some context, and then fourth quarter to first quarter and then kind of see what we see from there. Going into the fourth quarter, we have the usual headwinds from investment -- from the investment portfolio and actually higher premium amortization than we've had previously, and that would cost us sequentially about $35 million. That's kind of the headwind. Now, that will come back to, because that headwind is attenuating each quarter, but that was a headwind. Against that headwind in the fourth quarter, we had some unusual benefits. We had the FX swap mark-to-market, which was about $5. We had a surge in deposits, both in developed markets and in emerging markets. Remember, they're valuable in emerging markets worth about $10 as a tailwind. And then we built our investment portfolio and added quite a bit of loans at the tune of about $20 million. Now, that was a larger bill than usual, but a better remunerated plan. And so, those are the kind of features that held us flat in effect from 3Q to 4Q. I think if we go into first quarter, you kind of take each of those in pieces, the investment portfolio, headwind, it's probably going to be about $25 million instead of $35 million. So you see it attenuate. And part of that is that the prepayment speeds are neutral we think from 4Q to 1Q. We have some tailwinds of deposits and loans and investments, but that's probably worth about 10 bucks. And then we still have a couple headwinds, we have the unwind of the swap mark-to-market which sequentially is worth 10, because you got to double up the positive turns negative. And then you have day count worth another 10 as a headwind. So that's kind of what gets us to the guide that we gave. Once we get through the first quarter, I think what we expect to see is that stabilization and what we're effectively expecting is that the investment portfolio headwind which was $35 million, but coming $25 million, it's going to start to trend down to $10 million a quarter. And why is that partly rates have been kind of working through the on the yield side and partly because prepayment speeds we expect to start to attenuate as we see higher rates. And so, we do expect some lesser headwinds. And against that, we think that the actions that we take on a more traditional basis will be worth about plus 10. And so it will be roughly neutral and stable from 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q and so forth. Obviously, it'll be range bound. And obviously, it'll be -- there's always a little bit of lumpiness that we get into, but that's our best estimate of what we're seeing today, based on the curves, the expectations of rates and so forth. Yes, I think I said 6% to 8%. So I think we're looking at ... ... whatever $35 million decline in the first quarter and then stable from there. And Ken, it's Eric. I also just remind you though, that is a growing -- it's a growing business, a growing asset at quite a high pace, right. And so I think the last time we had one of these, it took 3 years from start to finish to kind of work out from discussion to RFP to response and so forth. And so I think there's [indiscernible] factor that into the -- to any scenarios that you run. Sure, Adam. It's Eric. Let me start. I think the way we think about our business on the servicing side is across segments, right. We have asset managers, we have asset owners, we have insurers, and our business is more geared to asset managers in the other segments. And so, we've historically built our franchise there, but we've actually done quite a bit of success in other -- in those other segments as well. Within asset managers, what we're starting to find is over the last year, last 2 years, the last year, in particular, we've actually secured more growth than the largest of the asset managers. They're obviously winning when you look at the external data, and either less growth or in some places decline in the mid size and smaller asset managers. And so what -- and that gap can be -- that gap in a particular quarter or a year could be a 2 percentage point growth gap, it could be a 3 or 4 percentage point growth gap, it bounces around. And so what we're finding is that, we really feel like we have the right coverage and intensity and kind of seniority focused on the largest of our clients. But our midsize clients are really an important part of our franchise. We built our franchise on them, we provide really, I think outstanding products and capabilities. And we're finding we need to spend both senior time on the midsize clients as well as the time of our relationship managers and client executives. And so this is really about intensifying our coverage of those groups, and helping them see the strength and the opportunities and the products and services that we can offer. And make sure we're top of mind that we're building on share of wallet. I've got share of wallet statistics for top 250 clients, and that includes the midsized players and really executing in that area day in, day out product one, product two, product 30, product 50, it's literally down at that level of granularity where we're focused now. Adam, it's Eric. I always like to hope that prepayments are burning through that there's been a one-time pop and then they're going to attenuate, but I've learned that hoping isn't a strategy, right. We just have to operate through the environment. I think what we've seen is certainly a surge of prepayments, starting in the end of 2Q, right, once people figured out how to do the paperwork during COVID in 3Q and 4Q. And our best estimate is informed by the various modeling providers. We subscribe to 3 or 4 of them, because we knew that diversity of opinion suggests that prepayment speeds should probably continue into the first quarter, and then I'll begin to edge down from there in the second quarter and the third quarter, with some stepwise improvement. That said, we've got -- I think we've got to live through time here and just see how it plays out and we'll know more. What we're trying to do, though, is make sure that we're always taking the actions that we can on investment portfolio, on deposit reinvestment, on loans, because that's something we can control and we need to stay focused on those actions. Ryan, its Eric. Good part of it is in the runway run rate I think we said about $3 million in 4Q. We do expect it to tick up one more step and we fix, we're now expecting about $5 million to $10 million a quarter in the coming years. So I think we're much less exposed than others. We don't have retail money market funds. We don't have high net worth funds with higher fees. So -- but those are the figures. Brian, it's Eric. Let me do those in reverse order. I think the -- what the $35 million was the headwind we're seeing on a quarterly basis from 4Q to -- from 3Q to 4Q in the investment portfolio. That was a combination of the investment yield grind down and actually higher premium amortization because we're still living through that wave. What I then said is that 4Q to 1Q, we thought the combination of the investment portfolio headwind including premium amortization would be about a $25 million headwind. And then I said starting in second quarter, we thought it would trend down even further to closer to $10 million -- $15 million and $10 million in those out quarters each quarter. So I think what we're starting to see is an attenuation or have that expectation, which partly is the kind of tractor of the investment portfolio playing through and partly lower levels of premium amortization expected as speeds begin to edge downwards. In terms of the deposit forecast and the earning asset strategy, deposits, it's really hard to gauge. The Fed continues to expand the money supply by what about $120 billion a month, we are at 1% or 2% of the deposits. So we pick up deposits just by being here every month. So there's some amount of tailwind. It's just really hard to read, given lots of talk about stimulus bills, asset allocation and reallocation from risk to -- risk on risk off to bar belling. So I think, right now, we're assuming that we're going to at least stay at these fourth quarter level of average deposits, with probably a little bit of edging up. And so we're not yet -- we're not at this point of expecting yet another surge, but you just don't know, and I think we'll obviously respond, and that happens. In terms of asset strategy, that's a tough one. I think it's tough for us and for every other bank, because we can certainly take some risks on the curve, but you don't get paid very much for it. And so, I think there's a balance that we're making, which is how much dry powder you want to keep. And so then when you do see a spike of interest rates, you can add your leg into that at a higher and better return versus forsaking some income in the short-term. And we're -- our investors are always kind of carefully picky about that, trying to be opportunistic and will come and go. And we'll do that in treasuries around the curve. MBS you've seen us build up. Our MBS book over the last year by a solid $10 billion. I think we want to just be careful there. We want to -- we prefer some of the prepayment protected sub-segments. We've done a little bit of credit. We want to be careful there too, because credit isn't -- is impacted during the CCAR and SCB process. So it's a pretty diversified approach. I think it's the core of our strategy, looking for opportunities. And I think as we see some of those will act, and we'll certainly report on them to all of you. Yes, Rob. It's Eric. There are a number of features in how we quantify the growth kind of headwinds, tailwinds of our servicing business. Client activity is one of those that fluctuates and really represents some of the trading volumes of our clients, because there's some tolling that we do for that, in particular, cash and derivative trades tend to have more likely have tolls than others just because they're a little more complicated, ETF creation, redeem that kind of stuff. So it's a part of our fee schedules that we try to quantify, but it has a long list of kind of volumetric elements. I think on a year-on-year basis, 4Q '20 versus a year ago, the -- that -- those some of the client activity volumes actually trended down. So servicing fees, it was worth about a percentage point of servicing fee headwinds. That's an example of a time it hits against us. For full year 2020, it was actually a positive of almost 2 percentage points. So we saw that as a tailwind. And obviously, the -- all the activity in first quarter, second quarter, in particular, was helpful. Next year, we're going to have to lap ourselves on that. So it'll probably be a 1%. headwind. So it's got that kind of effect. And what it does is it reminds us that everything matters in our business to drive growth, right. If there's an equity market, tailwind or headwind that matters. This client activity matters, as well net new business, right, and [indiscernible] I referenced kind of the importance of gross new sales matters, and then there's always the normalized fee headwinds. And the good news on that last one is that those have normalized back to something pretty close to historical levels."

Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRonald O’Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we released our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Let me start by saying how proud I am of our team members worldwide who continue to put our clients first and deliver strong results for our shareholders in these extraordinary times.  Turning to Page 3, our vision is clear and remains that of becoming the leading services and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital. Despite the challenges of the current operating environment, we continue our strategic pivot in investment services from being primarily a fund servicer to being an enterprise outsource provider, further enabled by our differentiated State Street Alpha platform. We are forging ahead with the implementation of our strategy, developing new business opportunities, and continuing to drive productivity improvements. As we successfully navigate the COVID-19 environment, we are operating against four priorities; one, delivering growth through deeper client engagement; two, improving our product performance and innovating; three, driving efficiencies through improved productivity and optimization; and four, supporting the financial system and planning ahead for our team members. I will provide you a short update on each of these areas before moving on to our results.  First, our clients are at the center of everything we do. This year we have proven that as a result of our strong operational capabilities we are able to effectively and efficiently on board new clients and install new assets in even the most volatile of market environments and we continue to see proof points of our operational excellence. For example, this quarter we successfully installed approximately 800 billion of investment servicing assets. This was accomplished while also driving sales and expanding the pipeline as demonstrated by the strong level of new investment servicing wins this quarter, which amounted to 249 billion. Our front to back Alpha platform drove approximately one third of these wins.  Of note, included in these wins was a front to back CRD middle office and core custody mandate with a large European asset manager that was not a pre-existing client relationship. Also, despite the challenges, we continued to expand in critical growth markets with the opening of a new office in Saudi Arabia to support our growing opportunities in the Middle East. Lastly, we continue to win new business and maintain a strong pipeline at CRD. For this quarter we more than doubled new bookings both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The institutional investor market is experiencing significant disruption. Our clients are facing increased pressures to effectively employ data to achieve better investment outcomes and drive efficiencies within their operating models. We are positioning ourselves strategically to meet our client's needs and help them with their own strategic pivot.  Second, product differentiation and innovation are critical elements of how we are driving revenue growth across the franchise. Clients continue to turn to State Street for our comprehensive and differentiated servicing capabilities. For example, we recently launched our new NAV Insight's product for our hedge fund clients. Elsewhere, the open architecture and interoperability of our platform will enable us to expand our capabilities and attract new clients by partnering with other service providers such as our recently announced partnership with SimCorp for the insurance segment in EMEA. At Global Advisors where assets under management reached a record level of 3.1 trillion this quarter, we continued to expand our product offerings including expanding our range of fixed income ETFs.  Third, we remain highly focused on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits as we strengthen our operating model [and cost] [ph] efficiencies even during this challenging period. Companywide productivity and efficiency efforts in just the first nine months of 2020 have so far achieved growth savings of 5% of our 2019 year-to-date total expense base, excluding notable items as we continue to gain efficiencies through IT optimization as well as other measures. The efficiencies we gain from the optimization of our business model to date are enabling both margin expansion and further investments to support our operations, client needs, and technology innovation, including our ongoing investments in CRD and our Alpha platform. Last, throughout this crisis, State Street has supported the financial markets and our employees. Our human capital is critically important to our success. We have safely reopened most of our office locations across the world and have brought back critical functions that operate more effectively fuller part time in office but most of our workforce remains work from home. At the same time, we are planning for the post pandemic workplace of the future. We believe that enabling better productivity, innovation, and fostering cultural attributes that set us apart are critical to our success.  As many of you know, Global Advisors has long been a leader in its stewardship efforts and its focus on diversity and good governance with portfolio companies. We are also addressing racial and social injustice by improving the diversity and inclusion within our own organization and advocating for the same in our industry. This is critically important to our leadership team and we are taking a number of concrete actions aimed at reducing these injustices, including 10 specific actions we have committed to executing, which I encourage you to review on our website. Turning to Slide 4, we present our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance highlights. You will see that as we continue to implement our strategy and improve our productivity, these actions are bearing fruit. First, looking at our third quarter results relative to the prior year period, total revenue decreased 4%, largely driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, fee revenue increased 2%, demonstrating the progress we are making as we work to reignite fee revenue growth as well as the year-over-year contribution from CRD.  Turning to expenses here again I am pleased to report that as a result of our continued productivity improvements, we have reduced both third quarter and year-to-date expenses by 2% excluding notable items. Productivity management is now a way of life for us and we will continue to build on this strong culture of expense management we have successfully established. On a year-to-date basis and excluding notable items, we have driven 3 percentage points of positive operating leverage, improved our pretax margin by 1.3 percentage points, and generated 19% of EPS growth relative to the year ago period. We have achieved these improved results in a very challenging operating environment, particularly the low interest rate environment that I just mentioned. Lastly, reflective of our business model our balance sheet and capital position are strong and we continued to operate with capital levels well in excess of our regulatory requirements. As we await the outcomes of the latest Federal Reserve stress test in the fourth quarter, given our strong capital levels and unique business model, we are considering a full range of capital return actions in line with Federal Reserve instructions and market conditions.  To conclude, despite the challenges of the current operating environment, we are navigating it well. We are implementing our differentiated front to back alpha strategy, developing new business opportunities, and continuing to improve our operating model, thereby driving productivity improvements. I am pleased that our third quarter and year-to-date performance demonstrate this and how we are making measurable progress in improving State Street's financial performance. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. To begin my review of our 3Q 2020 results I'll start on Slide 5. As you can see on the top left panel, during the third quarter we recorded good growth in both servicing and management fees. Our expense discipline continues to bear fruit too with total expenses down 4% year-on-year and 2% ex-notables. On the right hand side of the slide, you can see two notable items, including a small legal release this quarter. Separately and for comparison purposes only, we have also called out some of the noteworthy impacts within NII which I will discuss more in more detail shortly. Turning to Slide 6, period end AUC/A increased to 11% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter to a record $36.6 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client inflows, and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A also increased as a result of higher equity market levels and net new business installation's. AUM increased 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter to 3.1 trillion, also a record. Relative to the year ago period, the increase was primarily driven by higher period end market levels, coupled with net ETF inflows offset by some institutional net outflows. Our SPDR Gold ETF continued to perform strongly, generating 6 billion in net inflows this quarter and taking in a record 23 billion year-to-date. Quarter-on-quarter, AUM increased mainly due to higher period end market levels, partially offset by cash net outflows as very strong inflows during the first half of the year reversed with a recent risk on sentiment.  Turning to Slide 7, third quarter servicing fees increased 2% year-on-year including FX reflecting higher average market levels, increased amounts of client activity, and net new business only partially offset by pricing headwinds which continue to moderate. Servicing fees were also up 2% relative to the second quarter, including the effects of FX driven by higher average market levels partially offset by sequential normalization of previously elevated client activity. As a result of our commitment to clients and our strong operational capabilities, we have continued to close deals and successfully on board new client business throughout this pandemic. On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize the statistics.  On the bottom right panel, we summarize the actions we're taking to further ignite growth. In 2019 you may recall that we saw servicing fees declined 6% year-over-year probably as a result of elevated pricing pressure which is now moderating. We quickly intervened by rolling out a client coverage model to our top 50 clients, instilling pricing governance, launching the new Alpha front to back offering, and working more closely with our clients. The result was to not only stabilize servicing fees, but also begin to drive growth in servicing fee revenues, which are now up 2% year-on-year and year-to-date. The next phase is to extend our enhanced sales coverage model to another 150 clients, leveraging both country and regionally focused segment teams to further develop our pipeline. We think this is worth another couple percentage points of servicing fee growth over time as we saw across our top 50 clients.  Turning to Slide 8 let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Beginning with Global Advisors third quarter management fees increased 2% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter, with a year-on-year performance largely driven by higher average market levels as well as net ETF and cash inflows partially offset by institutional outflows. For a complete view of our investment management segment revenues we've included a page in the addendum, which also includes fees we earn as a marketing agent as we do for our SPDR Gold ETF, which are booked in other GAAP lines. All in total investment management segment fee revenues increased 5% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter and the business segment margin reached 29% this quarter. With the third quarter complete, we anticipate that the likely impact of money market fee waivers net of distribution expense will be within the previously announced $10 million to $15 million range for full year 2020.  Turning to FX trading services, third quarter results were up 4% year-on-year, but were down 15% quarter-on-quarter as we saw the second quarter bump proceed. Securities finance revenue decreased 28% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower client balances and lower agency reinvestment yields affecting the industry. Securities finance revenue was down 9% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of those lower yields. Finally, third quarter software and processing fees increased 21% year-on-year, but were 30% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to next as well as market related adjustments.  Moving to Slide 9, we show a view of CRD’s business performance and revenue growth. As you can see, we have separated CRD revenues into three categories; on premise, professional services, and software enabled revenues. The slide illustrates the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the 606 revenue recognition accounting standards for on premise and more importantly, it demonstrates the consistent growth in the more predictable streams of software as a service and professional services revenues. As a reminder, second quarter CRD standalone revenue of 145 million was primarily driven by a large wealth on premise -- implementation and several large asset manager renewals. This quarter CRD standalone revenue was a more normalized 99 million. Looking over a broader time horizon, you can see that total revenue, as well as the SaaS and professional fee revenue growth are strong, up 16% and 20% respectively. As we continue to invest in and expand the CRD platform, we are seeing good momentum in the business and we now expect full year CRD standalone revenue growth to be in the low double-digits. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter NII declined 26% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter. Excluding the impact of episodic and true ups, NII was down 20% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter. As a reminder, the year ago period included approximately 20 million of episodic market related benefits related to the FX swap mark-to-market and hedge effectiveness. This quarter’s NII included a negative true-up as we recognized approximately 20 million from OCI to net interest expense related to the prior period transfers of securities from AFS to HTM. Year-on-year the change in NII was primarily driven by the impact of lower market rates, the impact of these two items partially offset by larger investment portfolio and loan balances. Relative to the second quarter the decline in NII was primarily driven by the impact of lower market rates, the roll off of MMLF balances, and this quarter's true up partially offset by a $5 billion expansion of the core investment portfolio, which was worth about $10 million of additional revenues.  On the right hand side of the slide, we show our end of period and average balance sheet trends. We currently expect to operate at around 190 billion of average deposits so that may actually increase given the Fed's continued expansion of the money supply. As a result this puts us in a position to continue to consciously expand the investment portfolio in the coming quarters to mitigate the effect of the low rate environment.  On Slide 11 we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex-notable so that the underlying trends are readily visible. 3Q 2020 expenses were down 2% year-on-year, but up 1% quarter-on-quarter, excluding notable items but including the impact of FX. As we continue to concentrate on driving productivity improvements and cost management in a challenging environment, we reduce expenses across four of five GAAP lines, comp and benefits, transaction processing, occupancy and other relative to the year ago period. Information system costs remain lumpy but we continue to focus on technology optimization and are making good progress. On a year-to-date basis total expenses are down 2% ex-notables relative to the year ago period, demonstrating the solid progress we are making in improving our operating model as we reduce gross expenses by about 5 percentage points, which is partially offset by natural growth and reinvestment of approximately three points.  Moving to Slide 12, in the left panel we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio. The investment portfolio increased to 112 billion as we thoughtfully put more client deposits to work, even as MMLF Securities continued to run off as anticipated. You will see that we continued to maintain a high percentage of HQLA assets, and as the short dated MMLF securities matured, the average duration of portfolio extended to almost three years at period end. In the right panel, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see we continue to navigate this challenging operating environment with strong and elevated capital levels. As of quarter end our standardized CET1 ratio increased by 10 basis point quarter-on-quarter to 12.4%, driven by solid retained earnings only partially offset by modestly higher risk weighted assets. Tier 1 leverage ratio was improved by 50 basis points to 6.6% as a result of our higher retained earnings and lower average assets. Consistent with the restrictions imposed on large banks by the Federal Reserve, we made no common share repurchases in the third quarter and cannot do any in the fourth. As Ron noted, we are confident in our strong and elevated capital position and we will consider a full range of capital actions, including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters on regulatory and market conditions allowed. Turning to Slide 13, we've again provided a summary of our 3Q 2020 and year-to-date performance. Our third quarter results reflect our focus on not only stabilizing but also reigniting fee growth, as well as the obvious headwinds from the low interest rate environment. Both our third quarter and our year-to-date results show clear evidence of how we are successfully executing on our strategy to improve State Street's financial performance and create shareholder value all the while temporarily holding elevated capital well above our regulatory requirements.  Turning to the rest of the year outlook, throughout the pandemic I've discussed our outlook under a certain set of assumptions. Now with three quarters of the year behind us let me share with you our current thinking, but with the caveat that the macroeconomic could continue -- environment could continue to change. We expect global central banks will keep short rates at current levels and long end rates will stay at current spot rates through year end. We also assume that average global equity market levels for the remainder of 2020 will be flat to current levels. With that backdrop, we now expect that full year 2020 fee revenue will be up approximately 2.5% to 3% with servicing fees expected to be up approximately 2% for full year, both of which are up from our previous guide. Regarding NII given the impact of continued lower long end rates we still expect full year NII to be down approximately 15% in line with our previous guidance.  Turning to expenses, we have successfully transformed the expense base and remain laser focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and operational efficiencies. We therefore still expect that full year expenses will be down 2% year-on-year, excluding notable items as we continue to find ways to reduce expenses. In regards to our provision for credit losses, we continue to see a range of outcomes based on evolving economic conditions and any credit quality changes. On taxes we continue to expect our tax rate for the full year to be at the low end of our 11% to 19% range. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRonald O’Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Operator, let's open it up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nRonald O’Hanley: Hi Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you. Hello there. So it's good to see that consistent and good new business growth, and I know that we get that on a gross basis all the time, but it looks good enough to be very positive on a net basis. I don't know if I can get you to comment on that, but the follow on questions that I have is it's also good to see the pricing moderation over the last couple of quarters in your conversation. The question I have is how do you know how durable that is, meaning how much of the book has gone through it, the confidence in what the pricing committee is doing, the next 150 clients, and then can clients just stick you up next year too, I just -- I'd love to get your -- just the overall feeling of confidence that we can keep this trend going in the right direction? Thanks. \nEric Aboaf: Thanks Glenn, it is Eric. Let me start on pricing and then we can cover the broader topics of pipeline and momentum. I think on pricing, we continue to feel that the actions we took right, literally centralizing and turning pricing into a very senior conversation internally here and management process for one have made a real difference in a practical way. And so while you turn back the clock and you see that historically this industry has always had some pricing compression, literally, because there's always appreciation in our fees due to markets, right, so there's always a natural balance that we play out with our clients. You know that history was in the range of 2% per year. We saw that expand to 3% and 4% headwind last year, which obviously was not something that we want to or expect to repeat. This year we thought it would be down to 3% and we updated our view that it'll be down at around 2.5% for the year.  And I think the perspective that we have is that that is largely due to a more heightened set of actions, governance, education to be honest, both of our team and clients. I think what happens next will, you know, time will tell. But I think there is not only the continuation of our intensity and actions here, but I think the other feature is that as our value proposition offering that kind of front to back offering, which connects the Charles River, the middle office, the [indiscernible] accounting becomes a bigger part of what we offer. Those contracts tend to be longer, they tend to be more integrated, they tend to be stickier and we think that's going to continue to provide some support to the pricing benefits that we've accrued and at least keep us at this level. If we can do better let me tell you, we will lean hard into that. But I think we're confident where we have gotten to and operating in this area.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay, so I couldn't get you on the net new business that's cool. Maybe Ron last one for me is you mentioned considering the full range of capital return options which is cool, you got a lot of capital to consider options on. You particularly have had a good long history in consolidation on the asset management side. I'm just curious your take of or observation on what's going on in the industry and if there's room for State Street to participate, not that you're not already a huge player? Thanks.\nRonald O’Hanley: Yeah, I mean, your observation is accurate. There's a heightened amount of consolidation going on. We think about it from two dimensions, not just as an asset manager, but also as a servicer to asset managers. So it's something that we're looking at carefully. We're always looking at our two businesses, investment services and investment management and trying to determine how we best optimize them and we like what we have. But to the extent to which we could add to it through some kind of a tuck in we will consider that also.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay, thanks for all that. \nRonald O’Hanley: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlexander Blostein: Great, thanks for the question. Good morning, everybody. So Ron, just maybe building on the last point around a pickup in asset management industry M&A obviously with Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley and there's been speculations that there could be others. How do you think about that from a service provider perspective? Obviously, on the one hand, I could see how that could be a net positive, given you guys are kind of in a sweet spot with sort of large global kind of giants, as you described them in the past. So perhaps maybe more volume, but pricing could come under pressure, given kind of the benefits of a larger platform. So help me think about that, is it a net positive or net negative for State Street that we see more consolidation in the asset management space and then specifically with respect to Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley, any risk or opportunities from a revenue side you guys see for yourself, I don't know to what extent you provide services to either?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes, so we're not going -- I'm not going to comment on any specific client situations, it's public that we serve both of them, but I'm not going to comment on that, Alex. But in terms of the impact on us, there's some negatives but there's also a fair number of positives. The negatives, obviously would be if we lost a client or if we consolidated but ended up at a different spot on the aggregate fee schedule. The positives are that in most of these situations we often are involved in some way right from the beginning, because of our knowledge of asset managers, our ability to help with operating models, the fact that we now have this front to back Alpha platform so there's -- we're often there at the table or certainly brought to the table quickly thereafter. The other thing that we believe we can stimulate with all this is if you're going to go through all the integration, you might as well go through a platform upgrade. And so we think that in some ways this is actually going to spur activity because oftentimes the synergies that are being promised or looked for have to do with the back office and operations and you're going to get even more synergies if you actually take the opportunity to overhaul the operation and have a true front to back kind of implementation done. So positives and negatives, but we think over time, probably more positives for us. \nAlexander Blostein: Great, thanks. And the follow up question for Eric around NII. So just to clarify that down 15% NII for the full year to get in line with prior, does that include the $20 million true-up in the quarter and sort of you're talking about this on a reported basis, which I think implies about $480 million for NII for Q4 so just double checking that? And then more importantly, how do you guys think about that runway developing into 2021?\nEric Aboaf: Alex, it's Eric. Yeah, we did do it on a reported basis that the 15%. So I think your estimate of what we're looking at for fourth quarter is in the right area. I think the way I describe this is first to describe this year and then maybe talk a little bit about next year. We've clearly been in this interesting environment that that fell sharply and what we're finding is that at this point we're starting to really slow the decline or the pace of decline of NII quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter. And so, you saw in our results this quarter, adjusted for the true-up will come back there if necessary down 11% sequentially. If you actually just open up the lens and say, how much was NII down first quarter to second quarter, it was down 16%. So we started at 16% 1Q to 2Q. This quarter we are at down 11% on a kind of underlying basis from 2Q to 3Q.  And to your point if you take our full year guidance and you've done the math like many others, we're looking down at around 4 maybe 5 percentage points from 3Q to 4Q. So you can see that pattern consistently slowing and that's really the effect of the kind of grind through the portfolio coming through, which slows over time offset by our actions to expand the asset side, whether it's loans, the investment portfolio, which I said was up 5 billion on average for the quarter. It's actually up 9 billion on an end of period basis. And then some expansion of what we're doing in that sponsored repo program. So, those are the puts and the takes.  As we look at next year it's a little early. But, our view is that that pace of reduction continues to slow and so we're probably looking at a couple percentage points from 4Q into 1Q or 2Q and then we see some stabilization at that level. And so I think you've seen us now really intervene and slow the decline. We'll see stabilization in 1Q or 2Q and then I think at that point, we can offset the grind down from the portfolio.\nAlexander Blostein: Very well, thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow up on that actually, Eric. The couple of percentage points from 4Q levels, does that utilize the same underlying assumptions that you laid out initially spot basically keeping spot rates unchanged and then also given the level of importance mortgage backed securities have on your portfolio, what assumptions are you making for prepayment rates or are you just holding those steady, are you assuming that they use a little bit what are -- what's embedded there, just so we can calibrate [moving forward] [ph]?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah Brennan thanks for the question, because each of those assumptions are very important, right. We're looking for this working -- looking for and driving towards an inflection here. So first on rates, I think we're looking at current short rates, which have become a little more normalized. Remember, we had an inversion between repo and treasuries, which now is normalized. So that's slightly beneficial. We're hoping that continues, that stays that way. And long-end rates in the 70 to 80 basis point range, they've been bouncing a good bit over the last week or so. So that's the broad assumption. I think, as you think about the assumption on MBS pre-amortization, prepayment speeds, we are assuming that third quarter and fourth quarter are at a more elevated level of prepayments and then we do expect some amount of burnout into first quarter, second quarter and going forward. And so that is an underlying assumption. We think that's a fair assumption given a look at the models and we obviously get models from the three to four providers and have our own assessment as well. But it is driven by that.  And then finally it'll be -- our performance will be dependent on the pieces that we can control. You know you've seen us expand our loan book. Our loan book, which is exceedingly high quality for our clients is up about 10% year-on-year. You see our investment portfolio is also up about 10% year-on-year. And, our sponsored repo [Audio Gap] and so our view is that we have more of those deposits can be put to work, whether it's the loan book or the investment portfolio over the course of a couple of quarters. And here you could see even this quarter, I gave you a sense for the difference, it makes a real difference and it lets us kind of lean in and drive this stabilization.\nBrennan Hawken: Excellent. Thank you for all that color, Eric. That's great. And then shifting gears to the servicing revenue, you referenced some new business installations. We saw also the sort of repeatedly [ph] of the equity market rally. And in the past, sometimes that has resulted in some -- the way the Street calculates your servicing fee rate to compress just because of the mix not all of your servicing mandates and contracts are purely based on asset levels. And so could you maybe help us unpack a little bit how much of the lag, how much of the servicing fee is not going up as much as the AUC/A was lags from new business installations where the revenue has not yet come on and how much of it might be from the market rally which naturally would only be partially captured due to some of those contract dynamics?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, let me Brennan take that from a couple of different angles, right. Equity markets are clearly a tailwind for our business and there's always a little bit of timing, but let's -- that's kind of the timing is really rounding. What's important really here is the average equity markets and the average equity markets across the globe, right. So if you step back, S&P is up 12%, 13% year-on-year. But the emerging markets are up, the international EMEA markets are actually down a smidge year-over-year. So it's the mix of those that matters. And then not only the EOP matters, but the average matters and so on average year-to-date we've got equity markets at up around 6%, which is beneficial. We've always talked about equity markets up 10, fees up 3. Fixed income markets up 10, fees up 2. And so we do have a tailwind of a point, maybe a point and a half of fees that are coming through on a quarterly basis or year-to-date basis and we'll take that.  Over and above that I think we've also got some net new business and so, to the question that came earlier and that folks are always asking about are our business wins are outpacing some of the bit of turn that you always get in the portfolio. And then we've been able to charge more on whether it's client activities or flows have been a little more positive this year. And those are coming through and offsetting some of the fee headwind. So I think there's a good mix in general if equity markets stay at this level, that'll help us with the compares on a year-on-year basis. But remember, third quarter to fourth quarter of 2019 equity markets were up as well, right. And so that'll help us on a sequential basis from 3Q to 4Q but year-on-year, we're also going to have a tougher comparison there as well for 4Q to 4Q. Anyway, there's a lot there, which is partly why I gave the overall fee guide for this year on servicing fees up 2% because we think that's a good indication of a bit of a tailwind then in equity markets around the globe. But also driven by our ability to drive new business growth, manage pricing, and then take advantage of some of the flows and activities that we're seeing. \nBrennan Hawken: Appreciate that Eric, but just the lag in new business billing versus the AUC/A coming on just what -- is there a lag with some of that, sometimes there is and so I just wanted to confirm, appreciate all that, that's a great color on the market dynamics and the beta? \nEric Aboaf: There is a bit of a lag but I think the EOP and the averages were relatively consistent for the quarter. And so we're not expecting a large lag adjustment into the fourth quarter at this point. There will be a little bit but because of the end of period and the quarter, the average was pretty consistent. I think it'll just play through more naturally. \nBrennan Hawken: Okay, thanks for clarifying that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. \nKenneth Usdin: Hi, good morning guys. Eric, I want to just come back to the capital return question, you have an 8% CET1 minimum. Just wondering if you can just level set us again now that SUB is totally done, we have the stress test ahead of us and the limitation through 4Q, what do you guys see as your limiting capital ratio and when you are able to get back into buybacks, do you go back to 100% capital return and how do you think about like what the actual excesses over just getting back to a more normal buyback plan? \nEric Aboaf: Yeah, Ken it's obviously an important topic we've been working through. In a way we've gotten to been forced to defer any of those decisions. But I tell you, it's one that we're anticipating and eager to act upon given how strongly capitalized we are. I use the word elevated capital purposely in my prepared remarks just because that's what we're running at, right. We've got significant headroom. I think there's a couple of parts to the question. So, I think first in terms of our capital ratios, binding constraint, it is now CET1. So, core risk weighted assets divided by common equity, Tier 1 capital. At this point, the leverage ratio is not really any more of a binding constraint. And you've seen us take advantage of that as we've reduced some of the stack of preferred on our book. And then as you think about CET1 ratio, we'd like to get that down. I mean there's very little reason that we should run above 12%. There's little reason we should run above 11%. And so there's at least 0.5 if not more. We're working through what's appropriate because we've got a lot of data over the last couple of quarters. So we want to factor in but there's a solid billion and half of capital there that needs to go back to shareholders over and above what would go back to shareholders just from the earnings that we create each quarter. And so, we obviously want to see the results I think as the Fed and market participants do of the new CCAR test. We went through all the assumptions, as I think you guys did too. And we think we'll show well. We're very comfortable with our SEB and I think what we'll do is kind of market dependent and also based on any Fed guidance for the industry we'd like to restart capital return and if we can do that in the first quarter the pace of that needs to be a little bit paced. It got to be careful in this environment. And we're careful bankers, after all. But our view is that we need to start and then we need to accelerate that pace of return so that we return more than what we earn each quarter and start putting that back into our shareholders hands.\nKenneth Usdin: Great, great color, thanks. And just to follow-up on expense question, you've been talking for a good while now that you think that the company should be able to take expenses down annually. And I know we'll hear more about this when you get to your formal outlook for the year. You did a very good job this year, still being at about down 2%. With the NII still being a headwind but fees looking better, how do you start to just think about that calibration and where are you in terms of just the ability to continue to net down the expense base? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah Ken and I appreciate your letting us answer that now and then as you say in January we'll give our annual guidance. I think I've been clear, I think we've all been clear here from the management team that down in expenses is the right direction of travel. And the direction and the volatility we've seen in market interest rates just reaffirmed that down is the new up and that's the kind of way we should operate in this environment. And I think what you've seen is us being able to do that now for effectively two years in a row. We did that last year if you adjust for the acquisition costs of CRD, we're doing that again this year. And I tell you, we have a lot of confidence in that momentum partly because that frame of mind, I think, has really kind of organically expanded through not only our management team, but our one downs and two downs. So we've got hundreds of people, hundreds of senior folks working on productivity and expenses all the while driving revenue growth and fees and so forth as you noted. But we're finding ways to do that across the line items, right. You saw four out of five of our expense line items down year-over-year and many of them were down quarter-on-quarter as well. And I tell you in our four operations area we continue to find ways to automate and reduce manual touches. And we think that has years of opportunity for us in technology we are driving a transformation and we've been clear there. And I think more broadly across our corporate functions or businesses, the notion of productivity kind of more outcomes per person is something we're actually adding measurement tools on so that we can in a more incisive way find opportunities. And I think that's why you've seen even with the pandemic, our comp and benefit costs are down 2% year-on-year. Even more if you adjust for the currency swing, our occupancy costs are down. And every one of those is a result of those pretty broad based and deep actions.\nKenneth Usdin: Great, thanks, Eric. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Graseck: Hi, good morning. \nRonald O’Hanley: Morning, Betsy.\nElizabeth Graseck: I wanted to just take in a little bit on the wins that you've been announcing recently, there's been several press releases on servicing wins for semi-transparent EPS. And I just wanted to understand how you think about the market opportunity there and how we should be expecting that's going to be impacting fee rates as they come in and what kind of time frame it takes from announcement to fully loaded and in the plant? Thanks.\nRonald O’Hanley: Yeah, so I think it's fair to say Betsy that virtually every active manager is thinking about these and there's a lot of work underway in many asset management firms. There's basically five firms have come out and actually launched them and I'm not sure what the total is. Most firms have much multiple funds, but of the five firms that have come out, we're servicing four of them. And I think that you'll find that many others, as I said, are looking at this and also many are looking at what's the experience of those that have gone first. So I think many firms view this as a potential new revenue opportunity in that case and to the extent that growth [ph] will be an opportunity for us. We have from a servicing and a servicing innovation perspective we've been on this now for a while. We're familiar with all the different ways of doing it and in effect are servicing most of the ways if not all the ways of doing it. But I think it's too early to tell whether or not this will be a game changer, but it's certainly something that we felt like was important enough that we needed to put some innovation against it. We have -- we've got great market share at this point, but on a market it is small and growing. \nElizabeth Graseck: And then just thinking about how you -- the fee rates associated with it, is it something that's going to impact the overall fee rate, is it like lower than traditional fee rate type of products or not, I'm not sure how it's priced? And then the other question is just how long does it take from an announcement to be loading up into the plant, is it like a two or three quarter loan or it's just growing with the product itself, which has made sense? \nRonald O’Hanley: Yeah, so I mean, the fee rate is higher but it's rate times volume. And I would say so far the volumes are -- they're growing but off of a very low base. So I think it's just too early to tell whether or not this will be a game changer for us. But again, our view was that it wasn't something we should ignore. We really -- because we spent time on it right from the beginning, we'd actually worked on some of the rulemaking around it with the SEC. We felt like it was something we should step into and we'll just see where it develops. Not being evasive, we just don't know.\nElizabeth Graseck: Okay, and since the investment has been made it would be a relatively high margin as these wins coming on to your platform?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yeah, I mean certainly to the extent to which any of the existing funds grow. Yes, high margin, we understand all the different models. So our -- what it takes for us to install them, I mean we understand it now. So it's not like a lot of new incremental costs.\nElizabeth Graseck: Okay, thank you. I appreciate that. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Just one clarification before I ask the question, the tax rate Eric that you mentioned, that should be 17% to 19% for 2020 at the low end, do I have this number correct?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, that's correct, 17% to 19% was the guidance. And we've reaffirmed that we're coming in at the low end of that range.\nBrian Bedell: That the guidance or the number. Okay, good. And then first question is on CRD, the low double-digit revenue guidance for 2020 to comprise a little over 100 million for 4Q. Just wanted to make sure that thinking about that correctly? And then as we move into 2021 given the new wins that you're seeing and the momentum you see on the Alpha platform, I guess maybe an early look of what you're thinking for core CRD in 2021 in terms of that growth rate potentially even accelerating from that low double digit or around the same or lower?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah Brian, on CRD I don’t want to get out ahead of myself for 2021. We're still doing the pipeline assessment growth and so forth. I got to tell you is that we're quite pleased with the growth that we've seen here. You know we bought a business that had top line growth of 7% a year. Last year we nudged that up to 8%, that was our first year of ownership. And this year we're looking at low double-digits with some upside relative to where we were a couple of months back. And you saw some, I think, some impressive wins in the second quarter with in the wealth space and some major renewals that kind of give you a sense for the kind of the effect of the State Street backing software offering has on the market and our ability to convert that into some significant adds to revenue.  Now, we'll have to lap ourselves next year. So that's obviously going to be the hard part quarter by quarter by quarter. And so we're doing all the things you'd expect us to do. We're expanding the sales force, we're expanding the technical base, we're expanding the implementation engineers. But I think we're real pleased with the trajectory and just a double-digit revenue performance two years into an acquisition. I think it gives us the confidence that not only did we buy the premier property in the space, but under our ownership it's very strong and on a top line basis. And that's just CRD itself, right. CRD is really part of that front to back Alpha offering and you've seen us expand that with partnerships, win business and custody and accounting and middle office with Charles River, and so I think that broader effect on our offering and our client discussions is shaping up nicely as well.\nRonald O’Hanley: Brian, I want to underscore that last point that that Eric just made, because we've been talking to you all right from when we acquired Charles River. We closed it in October of 2018 and we started talking about how the pipeline was developing for not just what we -- Charles River, but also for a broader front to back kinds of offerings. You'll note that in our new business wins this year of this quarter, a third of those wins were Alpha related. So remember, that means that it's not just a CRD win but we're getting out of that some form of the middle office and the back office. And we said that we were seeing it develop, we said that not only would we drive what we drive CRD wins off of our existing custody platform, but that we saw CRD and the Alpha platform as potentially driving back office wins. And we're starting to see that. I noted that one of the Alpha wins was large European asset manager that we had no existing relationship with before. So we've gone -- we'll go from zero to having CRD, the middle office, and front services. So that's how you should think about CRD both in and of itself as a software provider, but also as part of this alpha platform and I will pivot to being an enterprise outsourcer.\nBrian Bedell: Yeah, that's great color. And then maybe just Ron, have you on some growth initiatives. ESG obviously you guys are very strong and [Technical Difficulty] AUM, maybe if you can talk about what the plan might be to launch more products that sustainably focused product, maybe especially on the ETF side, and obviously we have seen BlackRock related space and then also on the servicing side, to what extent within your data analytic offerings are you able to integrate ESG data and analytics services for your client?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yeah, I mean, you've outlined it well in terms of how we think about it. Most of the -- much of the visible ESG activity to date has been in SSGA and in addition to all the stewardship work that they do, there's been much new product and more new product on the drawing board. What's as exciting for us though is that if these managers are now integrating ESG into their overall investment risk framework and overall portfolio construction that's driving more and more needs for measurement, data analysis, etcetera. So we've got a series of products that we're working on now that will help support that. So stay tuned on this. It's something that's very important to us. We're actually -- we're even thinking about it in terms of how we put our resources together across the firm on this and go out on a united front. So you'll see more of this in the next few quarters. \nBrian Bedell: Okay it is Great. That's great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael Carrier: Good morning and thanks for taking the question, just a quick one on the 150 clients you mentioned reviewing and working on, is there any difference it was this group versus the prior 50 that could create a different outcome?\nRonald O’Hanley: No, I think what's -- the way we think about it, Mike, is that we rolled out a more sophisticated and engaged and kind of action oriented coverage structure on the top 50 starting at the end of 2018 and that's really took effect this year. And that's about folks with a kind of a sales orientation, with a deep relationship, kind of building orientation, a sophistication to leverage the whole organization and bring it to bear to our clients. And what I tell you is that that actually has created at least several points of additional fee growth for that group over and above what we're seeing for the rest of our client base, right. And so as we step back, we're saying, wow, given that that has created differential amounts of revenue growth and we track it, right, we track the top 50, we track the rest of the client base and then we further sub segment below what we've decided to do is take the learnings. Now, you don't take them kind of pound for pound because there's a cost to a coverage organization. There is productivity and loading that you want to think about with a coverage organization with different sized clients. But, the client base, the next 150 clients are not dissimilar from the largest or just tend to be maybe in one or two investment areas if they're servicing clients as opposed to three, four or five. They may be $50 billion or $100 billion clients instead of trillion or $2 trillion clients. But these are our clients in the next 150 are large, their scale, they can take advantage of our custody, accounting, middle office, front office services. And so I think they're similar in a lot of ways. And that's why we think that in a more intense and orchestrated coverage organization, which really then has the ability to unleash another several points of revenue growth there, can then help lift the overall revenue growth of the franchise in a way that we've already seen for the top 50.\nMichael Carrier: Got it. Alright, thanks a lot. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. So Eric wanted to start with a question on the securities portfolio, the duration increased sequentially, it now sits at about 2.9 years and there will be a little bit of a surprising development just given the accelerating prepayment activity. Now some investors and admittedly not all, but some are speculating we could see some steepening in the curve in the event of a blue wave and various inflationary programs are launched. And I know that outcome is not contemplated in the NII guide, for some of you could just speak to how you're handicapping extension and AUC/A risk, maybe you could just frame the capital and duration sensitivity if we do see 50 or 100 ways of steepening?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, Steve it's Eric. Those are exactly the kind of the balancing -- the balancing drivers that we are quite careful of. To your point we model out all the uprate scenarios, 50, 100, 150, 200 and what you've seen us do is both be, I think, considered in how much maturity and duration we've put on. We've historically run at this 2.5 to 3 year range of duration. So I think we're within that band. We added a little more to offset some of the shortening that came on MBS prepayments. So we did that consciously, but we also didn't see us take that up to four or five-year duration and run long on 10 year and 30 year bonds. So I think it's calibrated. One of the tools we use here, though, is not only to think about where we play on the curve, right where this is really the middle part of the curve. This is five and six-year maturity paper on average with some a little longer. But, we're careful. But we also use the HTM accounting designation because a lot of what we hold we'd like to hold for to maturity. And you've seen us put 40 billion, 45 billion of securities and health to maturity, which insulates it from the OCI pressure. And we do that very, very consciously. And we also are quite purposeful in what we put in to maturity, because we think that's got to be pristine. It's government paper, it's government guaranteed paper. And so that's how we balance the uprate scenarios, is through a mix of kind of just carefulness on duration and then the HTM accounting. And I think in a lot of ways that lets us feel comfortable that, we always need a volatility buffer in capital, but we don't want to have one that's inordinately large because then we couldn't return capital to shareholders. And, that's why earlier in some of my remarks, I described that there's a solid amount of capital to give back. We need to keep some for the OCI volatility, but we think we can manage that to a reasonable levels, given the portfolio design and some of the accounting designation.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, thanks for that color, Eric. And maybe just as my follow-up, just wanted to ask on the investment management strategy. The segment did see a nice lift in pre-tax margin this quarter for the profitability has consistently lagged some of the traditional asset management peers. And just with the latest wave of consolidation now how are you thinking about scale adequacy of the platform, especially on the active side, and just given more subdued profitability, as well as a significant capital cushion arc that you cited, just how may you look to reposition this segment to compete more effectively and I guess more specifically, how does an organic growth fit into that strategy?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yeah, so it is Ron. These are exactly the questions that are very much on our mind and that we're working through quite actively. We'd like the franchise, it's got some terrific assets to it, particularly the ETF franchise. And you're seeing more and more that that's an area where the big are getting bigger and it's just hard if you're not in a top three or four position there. But it also has its challenges, right. It's a fairly narrow platform from a product perspective. So it operates really at the beta, the active beta and quad beta and is relatively small and things like alternative. So thinking about it from a product perspective, both organic and inorganic. And then obviously from a distribution perspective, it's the only distribution we have is our institutional distribution. So, we'll probably talk more about this at some of the upcoming conferences as we finish through our work. But it's something that we're actively considering and evaluating. \nSteven Chubak: Great, look forward to hearing more about it. Thanks so much, Ron.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Harte: Hi, good morning. Can you talk about the value of kind of deposits to State Street and I guess I'm thinking about it from the angle of with deposits up a lot, 20% from year-over-year, NIM as low as I can ever having remember seeing it. And you're holding a bunch of capital events, the balance sheet is just kind of swollen with these deposits. At some point in time it has become economically advantageous to kind of turn deposits away, say, through pricing and delever the balance sheet, return more capital to shareholders, assuming the Fed lets you buy stuff back?\nEric Aboaf: Jeff it is Eric. Those are all the right questions that we -- that I think we as bankers have to navigate through. I think what's changed and is particularly important for us as a bank is that the binding constraint for us has actually shifted. Two, three, four years ago, it was around leverage and probably around Tier 1 leverage, probably around supplementary leverage ratios, right which have an expanded kind of view of the balance sheet. And those rules though were effectively adjusted over the last year I think in such a way that they became more rational and didn't put us in this position where we needed to any longer push away client deposits, which is something we did do. I remember in 2017 that was one of the actions that we took and it wasn't very pleasing to us or to our clients. But we're no longer in that position. What's really changed now is that it's the common equity Tier 1, the risk weighted asset ratios that really matter, both the spot ratio, then under CCAR and the FCB. And because of that shift, we were effectively in this position where we're open for business on deposits. And while in a kind of -- in a way it's a larger balance sheet, it's 20% larger, that's not constraining for us. And what that does put us in a position to do is to carefully expand the investment portfolio. You've seen us do that this year, continue to lend more to our clients, and you've seen us do that as well. And so that's the path we're taking, which I think actually supports the financial system in the right way as we lend and expand the investment portfolio, it supports our clients and to be honest, that'll come back as earnings and returns to our shareholders.\nRonald O’Hanley: Jeff, what I would add to that is many of these deposits, to the extent to which we push them away, we create operational complexity for our clients because most of these deposits that we get are associated with our custody activities. So when you start to separate those, you're creating some operational complexity. And Eric noted that we did some of this mostly in year 2016, 2017, and it would be hard for us to get those deposits back if we did that too. So, if you believe that these are going to be useless forever, it might be something that you'd be willing to do. But given the lack of constraint, given the fact that it creates operational complexity for our clients and given -- and to retain that optionality if and when, in fact you do see a steepening of the curve or even increase in rates, we like our approach.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, the current approach drives 85 basis point of spread income effectively on those deposits because many of those are actually priced at zero or one basis point. Not as much as we'd like, but to be honest, that's remunerating to the income line and to our shareholders. And over time, there will be some normalization of rates, we could see that expand again.\nJeffrey Harte: Okay, and just a quick kind of bigger picture follow up. It's probably too soon to tell, but have you seen or do you expect to see any impact kind of versus the pre-COVID environment in servicing and as far as kind of the trend of industry consolidation or maybe even pricing pressure do you see things changing because of with the whole work at home and just everything we're kind of facing now versus a year ago?\nRonald O’Hanley: I think the trend that's most visible to us at this point is that investment managers, even asset owners of sovereign wealth funds plan sponsors are really taking a hard look at their operating model. They were before, if anything this has put more spotlight on those operating models. I mean, we had instances where we had clients, the example I'm thinking of was an asset owner had roughly 1700 employees and had the ability to have 70 of them working from home from a technology perspective. So there's a broad based look at operating models, which we think will be beneficial to us. You know, ultimately, as long as you believe that investment markets are going to continue to function and grow what we do will still be there. What we're positioning ourselves strategically for is that as these operating models need to be overhauled, we want to be the enterprise outsourcers there that's doing it for them, taking on as much as we can of the front, middle and back office.\nJeffrey Harte: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Juneja: Hi Eric and Ron, couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, can you give an update on you've had a good run with the internal [ph] revenue growth as you mentioned. Can you give an update on where you stand on the synergies that you've achieved and accretion dilution?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, in fact we continue to run well along those lines. I think we had said that accretion would turn positive by the end of the second year. We effectively have gotten to that point, given that the synergies have come in both on the revenue and the expense side. I think the expense synergies came in actually a little faster than expected. I think we've always historically been good at expenses as a company. And the revenue synergies have come in quite nicely. They've moved around a little bit. We had some synergies from some of our sponsored repo activities sold into the CRD base, which came in a little lighter because of the compression in rates. But some of the fee activity that we have and the sales activity that came from the State Street franchise have come in stronger. You saw the very significant wealth of when and some of the other activity. So I think we're really pleased with where we are and has hit our milestones.\nVivek Juneja: Thanks on that, a couple of different one, Eric, for you. The reverse repo business, you know, it's been shrinking, you've shrunk quite a bit. The last couple of quarters the spreads have diminished. Do you see it shrinking further or is it stabilizing, what are you seeing in spreads, any color on that?\nEric Aboaf: You know, the sponsor repo business is something that we've done. It started small, it got to 50 billion, 75 billion, 100 billion of assets, it got north of that. Sometimes it's spiky. We had months or we're at 150 billion. We're back now in the kind of $80 billion to $90 billion range. And the biggest driver has been the changes in front end rates, right. Repo rates and kind of one-month T bills tend to create movements in positions of asset managers who are very focused on overnight out through one-month paper. And, because T bills were suddenly more attractive during really the spring and part of the early summer, we saw that that sponsored repo balances come back down. We've now seen some, I think, normalization in those rates. I think they're back to being 5 to 10 basis points a part. We think that gives us some opportunity and we've seen a bit of growth here over the last month or two. And I think we're notwithstanding the flood of cash from the central banks, see some amount of upside there. And that's what we're working towards. That comes through our NII line and that could be a -- that is factored into some of our forecast but that's the kind of area that we're pushing on.\nVivek Juneja: Thanks for that, if I may sneak in one more, Eric, what types of securities are you at and the most recent purchases that you've done? \nEric Aboaf: Vivek, I think you mean on the investment portfolio. \nVivek Juneja: Yes, investments portfolio, I shifted gears on you. Sorry.\nEric Aboaf: I'm okay with the off balance sheet client sponsor program questions or the on balance sheet investment portfolio questions. They're both good ones. On the investment portfolio itself what we've done is we've continued to do a couple of things. I think, first, we've gently expanded our MBS portfolios so we are up 9 billion in securities and up here at the end of this quarter, I'd say, 5 billion to 6 billion of that would be in the MBS space. But we have rotated the types of mortgage backed securities. You'll see eventually the regulatory filings that we expanded a little more in CMOs, in commercial MBS, all government guaranteed because part of what we're doing is trying to put on some cleaner duration paper as opposed to take up premium at risk. And we've also continued to hunt in the specified pools and not just the current coupon. So that's been some of the rotations there. And then we've supplemented that with a little bit of expansion in the international areas around some foreign sovereigns and then some of the triple-A agencies have also been an area of expansion.\nVivek Juneja: Greg, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMichael Mayo: Hi, I guess one kind of easy question, one tougher question. But first, so end of period loans were up, is that right, why is that, what seems to be a little different?\nEric Aboaf: Mike, end of period loans were up but they were up slightly, we like lending to be up in this environment given that we're there for our clients. We had two offsetting factors, we had number one the continued growth in our client lending capital co-financing in particular continues to be a real important part of our growth to the managers. And that was just offset by some amount of reduction in the overdraft balances on an end of period basis. But the net was up slightly and I think more indicative is total loans were up about 9% or 10% year-over-year.\nMichael Mayo: Okay, and have you said anything about cutting costs in 2021, how should we think about costs next year?\nEric Aboaf: I guess you continue to ask the easy question. So we've not given outright guidance for next year, Mike, we'll do that in January. But we've been clear that we reduce costs this year, 2% last year, adjusted for the acquisition we were down 2%. And we continue to like the approach given the economic environment to drive costs down. And we think that's appropriate. So those are in our plans and what we're working through is what's the magnitude of that next year. Because what we do need to do is continue to drive for gross cost savings. But we also need to reinvest in our business and especially as we add new business and you saw some of the wins this year, we're going to have to implement that. Some of that takes some funding. And then we want to continue to invest and expand into product, features, and so forth of the platform. And that front to back platform in particular, which is going to take some resources. But net-net, we expect costs to continue to be down not only this year, but also next year.\nRonald O’Hanley: Mike, what I would add to that is we've been very clear that this is not a one and done kind of thing. I mean, sure, there's some tactical things that we -- that if they're there, low hanging fruit, you have to grab at it, you realize that. But we've been -- we're on a sustained program to transform our business. Much of it is around productivity improvement and much of that is driven by the ongoing automating of processes, reduction of manual processes, etcetera. So this is -- I mean, you should expect us to be thinking about this and implementing this on an ongoing basis.\nMichael Mayo: OK, that's a good segue to my harder question, which is maybe I will phrase it like a Jeopardy question. So the answer, I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, is what you're doing is you're improving efficiency, productivity, automation. You're expanding your revenue streams, as you said at the start Ron and now you're extending the total addressable market with more focus, not just in the top 50 but the next 150. And I guess the question is why and is part of the why because assets under custody were up 11% year-over-year and the servicing fees were only up 2%, in other words, I don't see the revenues keeping up with the business volume and therefore you have to go to these alternative streams and I guess really the question is, what are you seeing on pricing pressure? You said it was easing. You said some business has been coming on at a higher margin, but, we're not seeing it in the final results that are released to us? Thanks.\nRonald O’Hanley: And Mike, let me start here, I would add a fourth element to what we're doing, which is also basically expanding our addressable market, meaning that moving from the typical traditional custodian role of being a fund servicer to also being an enterprise outsourcer and to work with the actual management companies or the plan sponsors on their own operating model. And that's just that's an incremental revenue stream that isn't available to us. Why are we doing it, the -- I mean, it's no secret that the traditional fund services business has its series of challenges, not just price compression, although that was done a good job at it. I mean, just think about it. Go back 10, 15 years ago, it was all about new funds being created. Somebody would have a line at domestic funds and they'd like move into other asset classes. They might move into new jurisdictions, new countries. Now, it's -- if anything you're seeing the number of funds go down as distribution platforms are saying, one, we don't want as many funds. And two, we're more interested in estimates anyway. So this is just these trends that are underlying our strategic pivot here.  Now, as we've also said, it takes a while for this revenue to be realized and you're kind of seeing that even in the way that we started talking to you about this expanded pipeline at the beginning of 2019 now we're talking to about front to back Alpha wins. And so you should expect to see that some of the things that we talked about in the past in 2019 and early 2020 we will start to be showing up in future quarters as Alpha wins, it is just these things take longer, because going back to what I said earlier, you're actually working with the management company on overhauling the way they work, the way they invest, the way they employ data, the actual tools that they're going to be using, the actual tools they are not going to be using. So I hope that's the why in terms of what we're doing here.\nMichael Mayo: And then last follow-up, just besides that so going for custodian to an enterprise outsourcer, at what point -- like what percentage of the firm or revenues would the enterprise outsourcing today, where was it a few years ago, where do you hope that to get to, and when do I transfer my coverage to our firms FinTech Analyst, that's enough because that’s the direction I you're going?\nMichael Mayo: I mean, it's a little early to talk about that and we will talk about our strategy more, some of the upcoming conferences and maybe we'll get into that. We haven't really thought about that. But I think your point I would agree with your points that you should expect to see it be a higher and higher percentage of what we do. And you're also accurate about the technology content in here. And this is very much a technology and a software driven strategy.\nMichael Mayo: Thank you. \nRonald O’Hanley: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning Ron, good morning, Eric. Eric, can you share with us you mentioned about the CET1 ratio, you are badly constrained in it. You said that it's obviously too high at 12.4%, even too high above 11, how low do you think you could comfortably bring that down to and then simultaneously, what's your thoughts about redeeming more preferred stock in 2021 or 2022?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, Gerard, it's Eric. Maybe to tackle those in reverse order it's a little early to think through the preferred question because we really want to see what happens with this next round of, kind of intermediate CCAR tasks and just see if there's anything different or not there. So, we're keeping an eye on it. We like the fact that we've already called a couple. Perhaps we certainly be happy to do more if we can. So I think that one is certainly always in mind and we'll give that some more thought. I think on the broader topic of capital ratios we're doing a lot of work here. And maybe just to frame out clearly we have too much capital given the limitations and that's fine. We'll get it back to shareholders as soon as we can. The bridge shows that we need to do is we clearly need to run above the 8% SCB requirement let's assume and we have confidence that that will stay in that -- at that 8% SCB, obviously subject to the Fed indications. But the work we're doing is how much CET1 capital volatility do you have for OCI. And that's where we're kind of working through well, how much can we, should we put in to help the maturity versus available for sale. So we have some ability to influence that and then we have some amount of volatility, to be honest in RWAs right in the risk weighted asset denominator just because you get volatility, you get a little bit of RWA expansion in the FX book. So, it is that it is -- you need volatility cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points probably. We as bankers want to run conservatively. I think what we're wrestling through is we are in the range of 11% is too high I've said. No, 10% is kind of one of those kind of areas that you want to think really seriously about crossing below, because there is some volatility in our business. And so somewhere in that 10% to 11% range, there's got to be somewhere that we'd like to run. And we're doing a little work to fine tune that. But I think if you do the math that way, you get to a view that there's really a substantial amount of capital to release from based on where we're running, because we're running at 12.5% and 12.5% down to somewhere in the 10% to 11% range is a real return, a sizable return for our shareholders.\nGerard Cassidy: Absolutely, that would be very positive. Moving little bit back into investment securities portfolio. Clearly, we're all focused on the rate environment and I think everybody's on one side of the boat, so to speak, in that rate environment is going to stay low for an extended period of time. But it also brings out the interest rate risk for a securities portfolio should rates go up, surprisingly for 2021 or 2022. What indicators do you guys keep an eye on, you can name two or three that really would make you change the way you look at your investment securities situation or where there could be a risk of a mark-to-market situation if they got out of line and rates started to go up, which, nobody's really planning for, the forward curve certainly doesn't call for that at the long end, so I was just curious how do you guys manage and keep an eye on this so that you don't get caught offside should something change unexpectedly 6 to 12 months from now?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard I think there are a number of indicators but part of what we do is we manage for the concerning outcomes, the downsides, right. So what we are careful in the portfolio is, you don't want to barbell between one-month paper and 30-year paper because you get a big move in rates. The 30 year hurts. Same thing with three-month paper and 10-year paper. So we're quite careful about where we operate on the curve. And it's not just an average duration that we run at, but we have a series of limits across the curve and we'll position to your point to be quite careful and circumspect. So that's one, there's kind of an outright management process and sort of places that we will operate.  I think in terms of indications, there's clearly a set of Fed indications and then market indications. The Fed's been quite clear about their policy around lifting rates. They've been quite clear about how long, they've been quite clear about inflation targets and kind of general monetary policy planning, and I think that's actually you've got to ascribe a fair amount of reliability to that. And then they're all the market indicators, whether it's the front end of the curve, the steepening, the volatility inherent in some of the curve structure is another indicator that we're very conscious of. And then I've got to say, there's no substitute for doing a running a battery of tests, a battery of stress tests, because you're always worried about what you don't know and what you're not seeing in the marketplaces. And, the good thing about rates markets is we've got 50 years plus of solid history. And we'll do all those tests and then we'll do the theoretical ones. So anyway, it's something we're very careful on, I think is the bottom line.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you, appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Your line is open.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Great, thanks. Mine is just a real quick question, a clarification question, so Eric, when you were talking about the NII on kind of the go forward past the fourth quarter, I think you said a couple of percentage points down first quarter, second quarter. But did you mean a couple of percentage points down in the first quarter and then another couple of percentage points down in the second quarter and then stabilized from there? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Good, good question Brian. I said a couple of percentage points down, either in the first quarter or second quarter. We think there's a small step down from 4Q to one or the other. It's just really hard because you're always working through what are the headwinds and tailwinds at an inflection point to call the trough. But we think it's sometime in the first half. And we think it's -- we think given what we know today and kind of the market indicators and the assumptions we've shared, we think it's one of those two quarters.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Okay, thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. That was our last question. I will now turn it over to Ron O’Hanley. \nRonald O’Hanley: Well, thanks to you all on the call for joining us.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ronald O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we released our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Let me start by saying how proud I am of our team members worldwide who continue to put our clients first and deliver strong results for our shareholders in these extraordinary times.  Turning to Page 3, our vision is clear and remains that of becoming the leading services and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital. Despite the challenges of the current operating environment, we continue our strategic pivot in investment services from being primarily a fund servicer to being an enterprise outsource provider, further enabled by our differentiated State Street Alpha platform. We are forging ahead with the implementation of our strategy, developing new business opportunities, and continuing to drive productivity improvements. As we successfully navigate the COVID-19 environment, we are operating against four priorities; one, delivering growth through deeper client engagement; two, improving our product performance and innovating; three, driving efficiencies through improved productivity and optimization; and four, supporting the financial system and planning ahead for our team members. I will provide you a short update on each of these areas before moving on to our results.  First, our clients are at the center of everything we do. This year we have proven that as a result of our strong operational capabilities we are able to effectively and efficiently on board new clients and install new assets in even the most volatile of market environments and we continue to see proof points of our operational excellence. For example, this quarter we successfully installed approximately 800 billion of investment servicing assets. This was accomplished while also driving sales and expanding the pipeline as demonstrated by the strong level of new investment servicing wins this quarter, which amounted to 249 billion. Our front to back Alpha platform drove approximately one third of these wins.  Of note, included in these wins was a front to back CRD middle office and core custody mandate with a large European asset manager that was not a pre-existing client relationship. Also, despite the challenges, we continued to expand in critical growth markets with the opening of a new office in Saudi Arabia to support our growing opportunities in the Middle East. Lastly, we continue to win new business and maintain a strong pipeline at CRD. For this quarter we more than doubled new bookings both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The institutional investor market is experiencing significant disruption. Our clients are facing increased pressures to effectively employ data to achieve better investment outcomes and drive efficiencies within their operating models. We are positioning ourselves strategically to meet our client's needs and help them with their own strategic pivot.  Second, product differentiation and innovation are critical elements of how we are driving revenue growth across the franchise. Clients continue to turn to State Street for our comprehensive and differentiated servicing capabilities. For example, we recently launched our new NAV Insight's product for our hedge fund clients. Elsewhere, the open architecture and interoperability of our platform will enable us to expand our capabilities and attract new clients by partnering with other service providers such as our recently announced partnership with SimCorp for the insurance segment in EMEA. At Global Advisors where assets under management reached a record level of 3.1 trillion this quarter, we continued to expand our product offerings including expanding our range of fixed income ETFs.  Third, we remain highly focused on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits as we strengthen our operating model [and cost] [ph] efficiencies even during this challenging period. Companywide productivity and efficiency efforts in just the first nine months of 2020 have so far achieved growth savings of 5% of our 2019 year-to-date total expense base, excluding notable items as we continue to gain efficiencies through IT optimization as well as other measures. The efficiencies we gain from the optimization of our business model to date are enabling both margin expansion and further investments to support our operations, client needs, and technology innovation, including our ongoing investments in CRD and our Alpha platform. Last, throughout this crisis, State Street has supported the financial markets and our employees. Our human capital is critically important to our success. We have safely reopened most of our office locations across the world and have brought back critical functions that operate more effectively fuller part time in office but most of our workforce remains work from home. At the same time, we are planning for the post pandemic workplace of the future. We believe that enabling better productivity, innovation, and fostering cultural attributes that set us apart are critical to our success.  As many of you know, Global Advisors has long been a leader in its stewardship efforts and its focus on diversity and good governance with portfolio companies. We are also addressing racial and social injustice by improving the diversity and inclusion within our own organization and advocating for the same in our industry. This is critically important to our leadership team and we are taking a number of concrete actions aimed at reducing these injustices, including 10 specific actions we have committed to executing, which I encourage you to review on our website. Turning to Slide 4, we present our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance highlights. You will see that as we continue to implement our strategy and improve our productivity, these actions are bearing fruit. First, looking at our third quarter results relative to the prior year period, total revenue decreased 4%, largely driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, fee revenue increased 2%, demonstrating the progress we are making as we work to reignite fee revenue growth as well as the year-over-year contribution from CRD.  Turning to expenses here again I am pleased to report that as a result of our continued productivity improvements, we have reduced both third quarter and year-to-date expenses by 2% excluding notable items. Productivity management is now a way of life for us and we will continue to build on this strong culture of expense management we have successfully established. On a year-to-date basis and excluding notable items, we have driven 3 percentage points of positive operating leverage, improved our pretax margin by 1.3 percentage points, and generated 19% of EPS growth relative to the year ago period. We have achieved these improved results in a very challenging operating environment, particularly the low interest rate environment that I just mentioned. Lastly, reflective of our business model our balance sheet and capital position are strong and we continued to operate with capital levels well in excess of our regulatory requirements. As we await the outcomes of the latest Federal Reserve stress test in the fourth quarter, given our strong capital levels and unique business model, we are considering a full range of capital return actions in line with Federal Reserve instructions and market conditions.  To conclude, despite the challenges of the current operating environment, we are navigating it well. We are implementing our differentiated front to back alpha strategy, developing new business opportunities, and continuing to improve our operating model, thereby driving productivity improvements. I am pleased that our third quarter and year-to-date performance demonstrate this and how we are making measurable progress in improving State Street's financial performance. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thank you, Eric. Operator, let's open it up to questions. Hi Glenn. Yeah, I mean, your observation is accurate. There's a heightened amount of consolidation going on. We think about it from two dimensions, not just as an asset manager, but also as a servicer to asset managers. So it's something that we're looking at carefully. We're always looking at our two businesses, investment services and investment management and trying to determine how we best optimize them and we like what we have. But to the extent to which we could add to it through some kind of a tuck in we will consider that also. Thanks. Yes, so we're not going -- I'm not going to comment on any specific client situations, it's public that we serve both of them, but I'm not going to comment on that, Alex. But in terms of the impact on us, there's some negatives but there's also a fair number of positives. The negatives, obviously would be if we lost a client or if we consolidated but ended up at a different spot on the aggregate fee schedule. The positives are that in most of these situations we often are involved in some way right from the beginning, because of our knowledge of asset managers, our ability to help with operating models, the fact that we now have this front to back Alpha platform so there's -- we're often there at the table or certainly brought to the table quickly thereafter. The other thing that we believe we can stimulate with all this is if you're going to go through all the integration, you might as well go through a platform upgrade. And so we think that in some ways this is actually going to spur activity because oftentimes the synergies that are being promised or looked for have to do with the back office and operations and you're going to get even more synergies if you actually take the opportunity to overhaul the operation and have a true front to back kind of implementation done. So positives and negatives, but we think over time, probably more positives for us. Morning, Betsy. Yeah, so I think it's fair to say Betsy that virtually every active manager is thinking about these and there's a lot of work underway in many asset management firms. There's basically five firms have come out and actually launched them and I'm not sure what the total is. Most firms have much multiple funds, but of the five firms that have come out, we're servicing four of them. And I think that you'll find that many others, as I said, are looking at this and also many are looking at what's the experience of those that have gone first. So I think many firms view this as a potential new revenue opportunity in that case and to the extent that growth [ph] will be an opportunity for us. We have from a servicing and a servicing innovation perspective we've been on this now for a while. We're familiar with all the different ways of doing it and in effect are servicing most of the ways if not all the ways of doing it. But I think it's too early to tell whether or not this will be a game changer, but it's certainly something that we felt like was important enough that we needed to put some innovation against it. We have -- we've got great market share at this point, but on a market it is small and growing. Yeah, so I mean, the fee rate is higher but it's rate times volume. And I would say so far the volumes are -- they're growing but off of a very low base. So I think it's just too early to tell whether or not this will be a game changer for us. But again, our view was that it wasn't something we should ignore. We really -- because we spent time on it right from the beginning, we'd actually worked on some of the rulemaking around it with the SEC. We felt like it was something we should step into and we'll just see where it develops. Not being evasive, we just don't know. Yeah, I mean certainly to the extent to which any of the existing funds grow. Yes, high margin, we understand all the different models. So our -- what it takes for us to install them, I mean we understand it now. So it's not like a lot of new incremental costs. Brian, I want to underscore that last point that that Eric just made, because we've been talking to you all right from when we acquired Charles River. We closed it in October of 2018 and we started talking about how the pipeline was developing for not just what we -- Charles River, but also for a broader front to back kinds of offerings. You'll note that in our new business wins this year of this quarter, a third of those wins were Alpha related. So remember, that means that it's not just a CRD win but we're getting out of that some form of the middle office and the back office. And we said that we were seeing it develop, we said that not only would we drive what we drive CRD wins off of our existing custody platform, but that we saw CRD and the Alpha platform as potentially driving back office wins. And we're starting to see that. I noted that one of the Alpha wins was large European asset manager that we had no existing relationship with before. So we've gone -- we'll go from zero to having CRD, the middle office, and front services. So that's how you should think about CRD both in and of itself as a software provider, but also as part of this alpha platform and I will pivot to being an enterprise outsourcer. Yeah, I mean, you've outlined it well in terms of how we think about it. Most of the -- much of the visible ESG activity to date has been in SSGA and in addition to all the stewardship work that they do, there's been much new product and more new product on the drawing board. What's as exciting for us though is that if these managers are now integrating ESG into their overall investment risk framework and overall portfolio construction that's driving more and more needs for measurement, data analysis, etcetera. So we've got a series of products that we're working on now that will help support that. So stay tuned on this. It's something that's very important to us. We're actually -- we're even thinking about it in terms of how we put our resources together across the firm on this and go out on a united front. So you'll see more of this in the next few quarters. No, I think what's -- the way we think about it, Mike, is that we rolled out a more sophisticated and engaged and kind of action oriented coverage structure on the top 50 starting at the end of 2018 and that's really took effect this year. And that's about folks with a kind of a sales orientation, with a deep relationship, kind of building orientation, a sophistication to leverage the whole organization and bring it to bear to our clients. And what I tell you is that that actually has created at least several points of additional fee growth for that group over and above what we're seeing for the rest of our client base, right. And so as we step back, we're saying, wow, given that that has created differential amounts of revenue growth and we track it, right, we track the top 50, we track the rest of the client base and then we further sub segment below what we've decided to do is take the learnings. Now, you don't take them kind of pound for pound because there's a cost to a coverage organization. There is productivity and loading that you want to think about with a coverage organization with different sized clients. But, the client base, the next 150 clients are not dissimilar from the largest or just tend to be maybe in one or two investment areas if they're servicing clients as opposed to three, four or five. They may be $50 billion or $100 billion clients instead of trillion or $2 trillion clients. But these are our clients in the next 150 are large, their scale, they can take advantage of our custody, accounting, middle office, front office services. And so I think they're similar in a lot of ways. And that's why we think that in a more intense and orchestrated coverage organization, which really then has the ability to unleash another several points of revenue growth there, can then help lift the overall revenue growth of the franchise in a way that we've already seen for the top 50. Yeah, so it is Ron. These are exactly the questions that are very much on our mind and that we're working through quite actively. We'd like the franchise, it's got some terrific assets to it, particularly the ETF franchise. And you're seeing more and more that that's an area where the big are getting bigger and it's just hard if you're not in a top three or four position there. But it also has its challenges, right. It's a fairly narrow platform from a product perspective. So it operates really at the beta, the active beta and quad beta and is relatively small and things like alternative. So thinking about it from a product perspective, both organic and inorganic. And then obviously from a distribution perspective, it's the only distribution we have is our institutional distribution. So, we'll probably talk more about this at some of the upcoming conferences as we finish through our work. But it's something that we're actively considering and evaluating. Jeff, what I would add to that is many of these deposits, to the extent to which we push them away, we create operational complexity for our clients because most of these deposits that we get are associated with our custody activities. So when you start to separate those, you're creating some operational complexity. And Eric noted that we did some of this mostly in year 2016, 2017, and it would be hard for us to get those deposits back if we did that too. So, if you believe that these are going to be useless forever, it might be something that you'd be willing to do. But given the lack of constraint, given the fact that it creates operational complexity for our clients and given -- and to retain that optionality if and when, in fact you do see a steepening of the curve or even increase in rates, we like our approach. I think the trend that's most visible to us at this point is that investment managers, even asset owners of sovereign wealth funds plan sponsors are really taking a hard look at their operating model. They were before, if anything this has put more spotlight on those operating models. I mean, we had instances where we had clients, the example I'm thinking of was an asset owner had roughly 1700 employees and had the ability to have 70 of them working from home from a technology perspective. So there's a broad based look at operating models, which we think will be beneficial to us. You know, ultimately, as long as you believe that investment markets are going to continue to function and grow what we do will still be there. What we're positioning ourselves strategically for is that as these operating models need to be overhauled, we want to be the enterprise outsourcers there that's doing it for them, taking on as much as we can of the front, middle and back office. Mike, what I would add to that is we've been very clear that this is not a one and done kind of thing. I mean, sure, there's some tactical things that we -- that if they're there, low hanging fruit, you have to grab at it, you realize that. But we've been -- we're on a sustained program to transform our business. Much of it is around productivity improvement and much of that is driven by the ongoing automating of processes, reduction of manual processes, etcetera. So this is -- I mean, you should expect us to be thinking about this and implementing this on an ongoing basis. And Mike, let me start here, I would add a fourth element to what we're doing, which is also basically expanding our addressable market, meaning that moving from the typical traditional custodian role of being a fund servicer to also being an enterprise outsourcer and to work with the actual management companies or the plan sponsors on their own operating model. And that's just that's an incremental revenue stream that isn't available to us. Why are we doing it, the -- I mean, it's no secret that the traditional fund services business has its series of challenges, not just price compression, although that was done a good job at it. I mean, just think about it. Go back 10, 15 years ago, it was all about new funds being created. Somebody would have a line at domestic funds and they'd like move into other asset classes. They might move into new jurisdictions, new countries. Now, it's -- if anything you're seeing the number of funds go down as distribution platforms are saying, one, we don't want as many funds. And two, we're more interested in estimates anyway. So this is just these trends that are underlying our strategic pivot here.  Now, as we've also said, it takes a while for this revenue to be realized and you're kind of seeing that even in the way that we started talking to you about this expanded pipeline at the beginning of 2019 now we're talking to about front to back Alpha wins. And so you should expect to see that some of the things that we talked about in the past in 2019 and early 2020 we will start to be showing up in future quarters as Alpha wins, it is just these things take longer, because going back to what I said earlier, you're actually working with the management company on overhauling the way they work, the way they invest, the way they employ data, the actual tools that they're going to be using, the actual tools they are not going to be using. So I hope that's the why in terms of what we're doing here. Thanks, Mike. Well, thanks to you all on the call for joining us."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. To begin my review of our 3Q 2020 results I'll start on Slide 5. As you can see on the top left panel, during the third quarter we recorded good growth in both servicing and management fees. Our expense discipline continues to bear fruit too with total expenses down 4% year-on-year and 2% ex-notables. On the right hand side of the slide, you can see two notable items, including a small legal release this quarter. Separately and for comparison purposes only, we have also called out some of the noteworthy impacts within NII which I will discuss more in more detail shortly. Turning to Slide 6, period end AUC/A increased to 11% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter to a record $36.6 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client inflows, and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A also increased as a result of higher equity market levels and net new business installation's. AUM increased 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter to 3.1 trillion, also a record. Relative to the year ago period, the increase was primarily driven by higher period end market levels, coupled with net ETF inflows offset by some institutional net outflows. Our SPDR Gold ETF continued to perform strongly, generating 6 billion in net inflows this quarter and taking in a record 23 billion year-to-date. Quarter-on-quarter, AUM increased mainly due to higher period end market levels, partially offset by cash net outflows as very strong inflows during the first half of the year reversed with a recent risk on sentiment.  Turning to Slide 7, third quarter servicing fees increased 2% year-on-year including FX reflecting higher average market levels, increased amounts of client activity, and net new business only partially offset by pricing headwinds which continue to moderate. Servicing fees were also up 2% relative to the second quarter, including the effects of FX driven by higher average market levels partially offset by sequential normalization of previously elevated client activity. As a result of our commitment to clients and our strong operational capabilities, we have continued to close deals and successfully on board new client business throughout this pandemic. On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize the statistics.  On the bottom right panel, we summarize the actions we're taking to further ignite growth. In 2019 you may recall that we saw servicing fees declined 6% year-over-year probably as a result of elevated pricing pressure which is now moderating. We quickly intervened by rolling out a client coverage model to our top 50 clients, instilling pricing governance, launching the new Alpha front to back offering, and working more closely with our clients. The result was to not only stabilize servicing fees, but also begin to drive growth in servicing fee revenues, which are now up 2% year-on-year and year-to-date. The next phase is to extend our enhanced sales coverage model to another 150 clients, leveraging both country and regionally focused segment teams to further develop our pipeline. We think this is worth another couple percentage points of servicing fee growth over time as we saw across our top 50 clients.  Turning to Slide 8 let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Beginning with Global Advisors third quarter management fees increased 2% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter, with a year-on-year performance largely driven by higher average market levels as well as net ETF and cash inflows partially offset by institutional outflows. For a complete view of our investment management segment revenues we've included a page in the addendum, which also includes fees we earn as a marketing agent as we do for our SPDR Gold ETF, which are booked in other GAAP lines. All in total investment management segment fee revenues increased 5% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter and the business segment margin reached 29% this quarter. With the third quarter complete, we anticipate that the likely impact of money market fee waivers net of distribution expense will be within the previously announced $10 million to $15 million range for full year 2020.  Turning to FX trading services, third quarter results were up 4% year-on-year, but were down 15% quarter-on-quarter as we saw the second quarter bump proceed. Securities finance revenue decreased 28% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower client balances and lower agency reinvestment yields affecting the industry. Securities finance revenue was down 9% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of those lower yields. Finally, third quarter software and processing fees increased 21% year-on-year, but were 30% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to next as well as market related adjustments.  Moving to Slide 9, we show a view of CRD's business performance and revenue growth. As you can see, we have separated CRD revenues into three categories; on premise, professional services, and software enabled revenues. The slide illustrates the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the 606 revenue recognition accounting standards for on premise and more importantly, it demonstrates the consistent growth in the more predictable streams of software as a service and professional services revenues. As a reminder, second quarter CRD standalone revenue of 145 million was primarily driven by a large wealth on premise -- implementation and several large asset manager renewals. This quarter CRD standalone revenue was a more normalized 99 million. Looking over a broader time horizon, you can see that total revenue, as well as the SaaS and professional fee revenue growth are strong, up 16% and 20% respectively. As we continue to invest in and expand the CRD platform, we are seeing good momentum in the business and we now expect full year CRD standalone revenue growth to be in the low double-digits. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter NII declined 26% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter. Excluding the impact of episodic and true ups, NII was down 20% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter. As a reminder, the year ago period included approximately 20 million of episodic market related benefits related to the FX swap mark-to-market and hedge effectiveness. This quarter's NII included a negative true-up as we recognized approximately 20 million from OCI to net interest expense related to the prior period transfers of securities from AFS to HTM. Year-on-year the change in NII was primarily driven by the impact of lower market rates, the impact of these two items partially offset by larger investment portfolio and loan balances. Relative to the second quarter the decline in NII was primarily driven by the impact of lower market rates, the roll off of MMLF balances, and this quarter's true up partially offset by a $5 billion expansion of the core investment portfolio, which was worth about $10 million of additional revenues.  On the right hand side of the slide, we show our end of period and average balance sheet trends. We currently expect to operate at around 190 billion of average deposits so that may actually increase given the Fed's continued expansion of the money supply. As a result this puts us in a position to continue to consciously expand the investment portfolio in the coming quarters to mitigate the effect of the low rate environment.  On Slide 11 we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex-notable so that the underlying trends are readily visible. 3Q 2020 expenses were down 2% year-on-year, but up 1% quarter-on-quarter, excluding notable items but including the impact of FX. As we continue to concentrate on driving productivity improvements and cost management in a challenging environment, we reduce expenses across four of five GAAP lines, comp and benefits, transaction processing, occupancy and other relative to the year ago period. Information system costs remain lumpy but we continue to focus on technology optimization and are making good progress. On a year-to-date basis total expenses are down 2% ex-notables relative to the year ago period, demonstrating the solid progress we are making in improving our operating model as we reduce gross expenses by about 5 percentage points, which is partially offset by natural growth and reinvestment of approximately three points.  Moving to Slide 12, in the left panel we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio. The investment portfolio increased to 112 billion as we thoughtfully put more client deposits to work, even as MMLF Securities continued to run off as anticipated. You will see that we continued to maintain a high percentage of HQLA assets, and as the short dated MMLF securities matured, the average duration of portfolio extended to almost three years at period end. In the right panel, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see we continue to navigate this challenging operating environment with strong and elevated capital levels. As of quarter end our standardized CET1 ratio increased by 10 basis point quarter-on-quarter to 12.4%, driven by solid retained earnings only partially offset by modestly higher risk weighted assets. Tier 1 leverage ratio was improved by 50 basis points to 6.6% as a result of our higher retained earnings and lower average assets. Consistent with the restrictions imposed on large banks by the Federal Reserve, we made no common share repurchases in the third quarter and cannot do any in the fourth. As Ron noted, we are confident in our strong and elevated capital position and we will consider a full range of capital actions, including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters on regulatory and market conditions allowed. Turning to Slide 13, we've again provided a summary of our 3Q 2020 and year-to-date performance. Our third quarter results reflect our focus on not only stabilizing but also reigniting fee growth, as well as the obvious headwinds from the low interest rate environment. Both our third quarter and our year-to-date results show clear evidence of how we are successfully executing on our strategy to improve State Street's financial performance and create shareholder value all the while temporarily holding elevated capital well above our regulatory requirements.  Turning to the rest of the year outlook, throughout the pandemic I've discussed our outlook under a certain set of assumptions. Now with three quarters of the year behind us let me share with you our current thinking, but with the caveat that the macroeconomic could continue -- environment could continue to change. We expect global central banks will keep short rates at current levels and long end rates will stay at current spot rates through year end. We also assume that average global equity market levels for the remainder of 2020 will be flat to current levels. With that backdrop, we now expect that full year 2020 fee revenue will be up approximately 2.5% to 3% with servicing fees expected to be up approximately 2% for full year, both of which are up from our previous guide. Regarding NII given the impact of continued lower long end rates we still expect full year NII to be down approximately 15% in line with our previous guidance.  Turning to expenses, we have successfully transformed the expense base and remain laser focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and operational efficiencies. We therefore still expect that full year expenses will be down 2% year-on-year, excluding notable items as we continue to find ways to reduce expenses. In regards to our provision for credit losses, we continue to see a range of outcomes based on evolving economic conditions and any credit quality changes. On taxes we continue to expect our tax rate for the full year to be at the low end of our 11% to 19% range. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Thanks Glenn, it is Eric. Let me start on pricing and then we can cover the broader topics of pipeline and momentum. I think on pricing, we continue to feel that the actions we took right, literally centralizing and turning pricing into a very senior conversation internally here and management process for one have made a real difference in a practical way. And so while you turn back the clock and you see that historically this industry has always had some pricing compression, literally, because there's always appreciation in our fees due to markets, right, so there's always a natural balance that we play out with our clients. You know that history was in the range of 2% per year. We saw that expand to 3% and 4% headwind last year, which obviously was not something that we want to or expect to repeat. This year we thought it would be down to 3% and we updated our view that it'll be down at around 2.5% for the year.  And I think the perspective that we have is that that is largely due to a more heightened set of actions, governance, education to be honest, both of our team and clients. I think what happens next will, you know, time will tell. But I think there is not only the continuation of our intensity and actions here, but I think the other feature is that as our value proposition offering that kind of front to back offering, which connects the Charles River, the middle office, the [indiscernible] accounting becomes a bigger part of what we offer. Those contracts tend to be longer, they tend to be more integrated, they tend to be stickier and we think that's going to continue to provide some support to the pricing benefits that we've accrued and at least keep us at this level. If we can do better let me tell you, we will lean hard into that. But I think we're confident where we have gotten to and operating in this area. Alex, it's Eric. Yeah, we did do it on a reported basis that the 15%. So I think your estimate of what we're looking at for fourth quarter is in the right area. I think the way I describe this is first to describe this year and then maybe talk a little bit about next year. We've clearly been in this interesting environment that that fell sharply and what we're finding is that at this point we're starting to really slow the decline or the pace of decline of NII quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter. And so, you saw in our results this quarter, adjusted for the true-up will come back there if necessary down 11% sequentially. If you actually just open up the lens and say, how much was NII down first quarter to second quarter, it was down 16%. So we started at 16% 1Q to 2Q. This quarter we are at down 11% on a kind of underlying basis from 2Q to 3Q.  And to your point if you take our full year guidance and you've done the math like many others, we're looking down at around 4 maybe 5 percentage points from 3Q to 4Q. So you can see that pattern consistently slowing and that's really the effect of the kind of grind through the portfolio coming through, which slows over time offset by our actions to expand the asset side, whether it's loans, the investment portfolio, which I said was up 5 billion on average for the quarter. It's actually up 9 billion on an end of period basis. And then some expansion of what we're doing in that sponsored repo program. So, those are the puts and the takes.  As we look at next year it's a little early. But, our view is that that pace of reduction continues to slow and so we're probably looking at a couple percentage points from 4Q into 1Q or 2Q and then we see some stabilization at that level. And so I think you've seen us now really intervene and slow the decline. We'll see stabilization in 1Q or 2Q and then I think at that point, we can offset the grind down from the portfolio. Yeah Brennan thanks for the question, because each of those assumptions are very important, right. We're looking for this working -- looking for and driving towards an inflection here. So first on rates, I think we're looking at current short rates, which have become a little more normalized. Remember, we had an inversion between repo and treasuries, which now is normalized. So that's slightly beneficial. We're hoping that continues, that stays that way. And long-end rates in the 70 to 80 basis point range, they've been bouncing a good bit over the last week or so. So that's the broad assumption. I think, as you think about the assumption on MBS pre-amortization, prepayment speeds, we are assuming that third quarter and fourth quarter are at a more elevated level of prepayments and then we do expect some amount of burnout into first quarter, second quarter and going forward. And so that is an underlying assumption. We think that's a fair assumption given a look at the models and we obviously get models from the three to four providers and have our own assessment as well. But it is driven by that.  And then finally it'll be -- our performance will be dependent on the pieces that we can control. You know you've seen us expand our loan book. Our loan book, which is exceedingly high quality for our clients is up about 10% year-on-year. You see our investment portfolio is also up about 10% year-on-year. And, our sponsored repo [Audio Gap] and so our view is that we have more of those deposits can be put to work, whether it's the loan book or the investment portfolio over the course of a couple of quarters. And here you could see even this quarter, I gave you a sense for the difference, it makes a real difference and it lets us kind of lean in and drive this stabilization. Yeah, let me Brennan take that from a couple of different angles, right. Equity markets are clearly a tailwind for our business and there's always a little bit of timing, but let's -- that's kind of the timing is really rounding. What's important really here is the average equity markets and the average equity markets across the globe, right. So if you step back, S&P is up 12%, 13% year-on-year. But the emerging markets are up, the international EMEA markets are actually down a smidge year-over-year. So it's the mix of those that matters. And then not only the EOP matters, but the average matters and so on average year-to-date we've got equity markets at up around 6%, which is beneficial. We've always talked about equity markets up 10, fees up 3. Fixed income markets up 10, fees up 2. And so we do have a tailwind of a point, maybe a point and a half of fees that are coming through on a quarterly basis or year-to-date basis and we'll take that.  Over and above that I think we've also got some net new business and so, to the question that came earlier and that folks are always asking about are our business wins are outpacing some of the bit of turn that you always get in the portfolio. And then we've been able to charge more on whether it's client activities or flows have been a little more positive this year. And those are coming through and offsetting some of the fee headwind. So I think there's a good mix in general if equity markets stay at this level, that'll help us with the compares on a year-on-year basis. But remember, third quarter to fourth quarter of 2019 equity markets were up as well, right. And so that'll help us on a sequential basis from 3Q to 4Q but year-on-year, we're also going to have a tougher comparison there as well for 4Q to 4Q. Anyway, there's a lot there, which is partly why I gave the overall fee guide for this year on servicing fees up 2% because we think that's a good indication of a bit of a tailwind then in equity markets around the globe. But also driven by our ability to drive new business growth, manage pricing, and then take advantage of some of the flows and activities that we're seeing. There is a bit of a lag but I think the EOP and the averages were relatively consistent for the quarter. And so we're not expecting a large lag adjustment into the fourth quarter at this point. There will be a little bit but because of the end of period and the quarter, the average was pretty consistent. I think it'll just play through more naturally. Yeah, Ken it's obviously an important topic we've been working through. In a way we've gotten to been forced to defer any of those decisions. But I tell you, it's one that we're anticipating and eager to act upon given how strongly capitalized we are. I use the word elevated capital purposely in my prepared remarks just because that's what we're running at, right. We've got significant headroom. I think there's a couple of parts to the question. So, I think first in terms of our capital ratios, binding constraint, it is now CET1. So, core risk weighted assets divided by common equity, Tier 1 capital. At this point, the leverage ratio is not really any more of a binding constraint. And you've seen us take advantage of that as we've reduced some of the stack of preferred on our book. And then as you think about CET1 ratio, we'd like to get that down. I mean there's very little reason that we should run above 12%. There's little reason we should run above 11%. And so there's at least 0.5 if not more. We're working through what's appropriate because we've got a lot of data over the last couple of quarters. So we want to factor in but there's a solid billion and half of capital there that needs to go back to shareholders over and above what would go back to shareholders just from the earnings that we create each quarter. And so, we obviously want to see the results I think as the Fed and market participants do of the new CCAR test. We went through all the assumptions, as I think you guys did too. And we think we'll show well. We're very comfortable with our SEB and I think what we'll do is kind of market dependent and also based on any Fed guidance for the industry we'd like to restart capital return and if we can do that in the first quarter the pace of that needs to be a little bit paced. It got to be careful in this environment. And we're careful bankers, after all. But our view is that we need to start and then we need to accelerate that pace of return so that we return more than what we earn each quarter and start putting that back into our shareholders hands. Yeah Ken and I appreciate your letting us answer that now and then as you say in January we'll give our annual guidance. I think I've been clear, I think we've all been clear here from the management team that down in expenses is the right direction of travel. And the direction and the volatility we've seen in market interest rates just reaffirmed that down is the new up and that's the kind of way we should operate in this environment. And I think what you've seen is us being able to do that now for effectively two years in a row. We did that last year if you adjust for the acquisition costs of CRD, we're doing that again this year. And I tell you, we have a lot of confidence in that momentum partly because that frame of mind, I think, has really kind of organically expanded through not only our management team, but our one downs and two downs. So we've got hundreds of people, hundreds of senior folks working on productivity and expenses all the while driving revenue growth and fees and so forth as you noted. But we're finding ways to do that across the line items, right. You saw four out of five of our expense line items down year-over-year and many of them were down quarter-on-quarter as well. And I tell you in our four operations area we continue to find ways to automate and reduce manual touches. And we think that has years of opportunity for us in technology we are driving a transformation and we've been clear there. And I think more broadly across our corporate functions or businesses, the notion of productivity kind of more outcomes per person is something we're actually adding measurement tools on so that we can in a more incisive way find opportunities. And I think that's why you've seen even with the pandemic, our comp and benefit costs are down 2% year-on-year. Even more if you adjust for the currency swing, our occupancy costs are down. And every one of those is a result of those pretty broad based and deep actions. Yeah, that's correct, 17% to 19% was the guidance. And we've reaffirmed that we're coming in at the low end of that range. Yeah Brian, on CRD I don't want to get out ahead of myself for 2021. We're still doing the pipeline assessment growth and so forth. I got to tell you is that we're quite pleased with the growth that we've seen here. You know we bought a business that had top line growth of 7% a year. Last year we nudged that up to 8%, that was our first year of ownership. And this year we're looking at low double-digits with some upside relative to where we were a couple of months back. And you saw some, I think, some impressive wins in the second quarter with in the wealth space and some major renewals that kind of give you a sense for the kind of the effect of the State Street backing software offering has on the market and our ability to convert that into some significant adds to revenue.  Now, we'll have to lap ourselves next year. So that's obviously going to be the hard part quarter by quarter by quarter. And so we're doing all the things you'd expect us to do. We're expanding the sales force, we're expanding the technical base, we're expanding the implementation engineers. But I think we're real pleased with the trajectory and just a double-digit revenue performance two years into an acquisition. I think it gives us the confidence that not only did we buy the premier property in the space, but under our ownership it's very strong and on a top line basis. And that's just CRD itself, right. CRD is really part of that front to back Alpha offering and you've seen us expand that with partnerships, win business and custody and accounting and middle office with Charles River, and so I think that broader effect on our offering and our client discussions is shaping up nicely as well. Yeah, Steve it's Eric. Those are exactly the kind of the balancing -- the balancing drivers that we are quite careful of. To your point we model out all the uprate scenarios, 50, 100, 150, 200 and what you've seen us do is both be, I think, considered in how much maturity and duration we've put on. We've historically run at this 2.5 to 3 year range of duration. So I think we're within that band. We added a little more to offset some of the shortening that came on MBS prepayments. So we did that consciously, but we also didn't see us take that up to four or five-year duration and run long on 10 year and 30 year bonds. So I think it's calibrated. One of the tools we use here, though, is not only to think about where we play on the curve, right where this is really the middle part of the curve. This is five and six-year maturity paper on average with some a little longer. But, we're careful. But we also use the HTM accounting designation because a lot of what we hold we'd like to hold for to maturity. And you've seen us put 40 billion, 45 billion of securities and health to maturity, which insulates it from the OCI pressure. And we do that very, very consciously. And we also are quite purposeful in what we put in to maturity, because we think that's got to be pristine. It's government paper, it's government guaranteed paper. And so that's how we balance the uprate scenarios, is through a mix of kind of just carefulness on duration and then the HTM accounting. And I think in a lot of ways that lets us feel comfortable that, we always need a volatility buffer in capital, but we don't want to have one that's inordinately large because then we couldn't return capital to shareholders. And, that's why earlier in some of my remarks, I described that there's a solid amount of capital to give back. We need to keep some for the OCI volatility, but we think we can manage that to a reasonable levels, given the portfolio design and some of the accounting designation. Jeff it is Eric. Those are all the right questions that we -- that I think we as bankers have to navigate through. I think what's changed and is particularly important for us as a bank is that the binding constraint for us has actually shifted. Two, three, four years ago, it was around leverage and probably around Tier 1 leverage, probably around supplementary leverage ratios, right which have an expanded kind of view of the balance sheet. And those rules though were effectively adjusted over the last year I think in such a way that they became more rational and didn't put us in this position where we needed to any longer push away client deposits, which is something we did do. I remember in 2017 that was one of the actions that we took and it wasn't very pleasing to us or to our clients. But we're no longer in that position. What's really changed now is that it's the common equity Tier 1, the risk weighted asset ratios that really matter, both the spot ratio, then under CCAR and the FCB. And because of that shift, we were effectively in this position where we're open for business on deposits. And while in a kind of -- in a way it's a larger balance sheet, it's 20% larger, that's not constraining for us. And what that does put us in a position to do is to carefully expand the investment portfolio. You've seen us do that this year, continue to lend more to our clients, and you've seen us do that as well. And so that's the path we're taking, which I think actually supports the financial system in the right way as we lend and expand the investment portfolio, it supports our clients and to be honest, that'll come back as earnings and returns to our shareholders. Yeah, the current approach drives 85 basis point of spread income effectively on those deposits because many of those are actually priced at zero or one basis point. Not as much as we'd like, but to be honest, that's remunerating to the income line and to our shareholders. And over time, there will be some normalization of rates, we could see that expand again. Yeah, in fact we continue to run well along those lines. I think we had said that accretion would turn positive by the end of the second year. We effectively have gotten to that point, given that the synergies have come in both on the revenue and the expense side. I think the expense synergies came in actually a little faster than expected. I think we've always historically been good at expenses as a company. And the revenue synergies have come in quite nicely. They've moved around a little bit. We had some synergies from some of our sponsored repo activities sold into the CRD base, which came in a little lighter because of the compression in rates. But some of the fee activity that we have and the sales activity that came from the State Street franchise have come in stronger. You saw the very significant wealth of when and some of the other activity. So I think we're really pleased with where we are and has hit our milestones. You know, the sponsor repo business is something that we've done. It started small, it got to 50 billion, 75 billion, 100 billion of assets, it got north of that. Sometimes it's spiky. We had months or we're at 150 billion. We're back now in the kind of $80 billion to $90 billion range. And the biggest driver has been the changes in front end rates, right. Repo rates and kind of one-month T bills tend to create movements in positions of asset managers who are very focused on overnight out through one-month paper. And, because T bills were suddenly more attractive during really the spring and part of the early summer, we saw that that sponsored repo balances come back down. We've now seen some, I think, normalization in those rates. I think they're back to being 5 to 10 basis points a part. We think that gives us some opportunity and we've seen a bit of growth here over the last month or two. And I think we're notwithstanding the flood of cash from the central banks, see some amount of upside there. And that's what we're working towards. That comes through our NII line and that could be a -- that is factored into some of our forecast but that's the kind of area that we're pushing on. Vivek, I think you mean on the investment portfolio. I'm okay with the off balance sheet client sponsor program questions or the on balance sheet investment portfolio questions. They're both good ones. On the investment portfolio itself what we've done is we've continued to do a couple of things. I think, first, we've gently expanded our MBS portfolios so we are up 9 billion in securities and up here at the end of this quarter, I'd say, 5 billion to 6 billion of that would be in the MBS space. But we have rotated the types of mortgage backed securities. You'll see eventually the regulatory filings that we expanded a little more in CMOs, in commercial MBS, all government guaranteed because part of what we're doing is trying to put on some cleaner duration paper as opposed to take up premium at risk. And we've also continued to hunt in the specified pools and not just the current coupon. So that's been some of the rotations there. And then we've supplemented that with a little bit of expansion in the international areas around some foreign sovereigns and then some of the triple-A agencies have also been an area of expansion. Mike, end of period loans were up but they were up slightly, we like lending to be up in this environment given that we're there for our clients. We had two offsetting factors, we had number one the continued growth in our client lending capital co-financing in particular continues to be a real important part of our growth to the managers. And that was just offset by some amount of reduction in the overdraft balances on an end of period basis. But the net was up slightly and I think more indicative is total loans were up about 9% or 10% year-over-year. I guess you continue to ask the easy question. So we've not given outright guidance for next year, Mike, we'll do that in January. But we've been clear that we reduce costs this year, 2% last year, adjusted for the acquisition we were down 2%. And we continue to like the approach given the economic environment to drive costs down. And we think that's appropriate. So those are in our plans and what we're working through is what's the magnitude of that next year. Because what we do need to do is continue to drive for gross cost savings. But we also need to reinvest in our business and especially as we add new business and you saw some of the wins this year, we're going to have to implement that. Some of that takes some funding. And then we want to continue to invest and expand into product, features, and so forth of the platform. And that front to back platform in particular, which is going to take some resources. But net-net, we expect costs to continue to be down not only this year, but also next year. Yeah, Gerard, it's Eric. Maybe to tackle those in reverse order it's a little early to think through the preferred question because we really want to see what happens with this next round of, kind of intermediate CCAR tasks and just see if there's anything different or not there. So, we're keeping an eye on it. We like the fact that we've already called a couple. Perhaps we certainly be happy to do more if we can. So I think that one is certainly always in mind and we'll give that some more thought. I think on the broader topic of capital ratios we're doing a lot of work here. And maybe just to frame out clearly we have too much capital given the limitations and that's fine. We'll get it back to shareholders as soon as we can. The bridge shows that we need to do is we clearly need to run above the 8% SCB requirement let's assume and we have confidence that that will stay in that -- at that 8% SCB, obviously subject to the Fed indications. But the work we're doing is how much CET1 capital volatility do you have for OCI. And that's where we're kind of working through well, how much can we, should we put in to help the maturity versus available for sale. So we have some ability to influence that and then we have some amount of volatility, to be honest in RWAs right in the risk weighted asset denominator just because you get volatility, you get a little bit of RWA expansion in the FX book. So, it is that it is -- you need volatility cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points probably. We as bankers want to run conservatively. I think what we're wrestling through is we are in the range of 11% is too high I've said. No, 10% is kind of one of those kind of areas that you want to think really seriously about crossing below, because there is some volatility in our business. And so somewhere in that 10% to 11% range, there's got to be somewhere that we'd like to run. And we're doing a little work to fine tune that. But I think if you do the math that way, you get to a view that there's really a substantial amount of capital to release from based on where we're running, because we're running at 12.5% and 12.5% down to somewhere in the 10% to 11% range is a real return, a sizable return for our shareholders. Gerard I think there are a number of indicators but part of what we do is we manage for the concerning outcomes, the downsides, right. So what we are careful in the portfolio is, you don't want to barbell between one-month paper and 30-year paper because you get a big move in rates. The 30 year hurts. Same thing with three-month paper and 10-year paper. So we're quite careful about where we operate on the curve. And it's not just an average duration that we run at, but we have a series of limits across the curve and we'll position to your point to be quite careful and circumspect. So that's one, there's kind of an outright management process and sort of places that we will operate.  I think in terms of indications, there's clearly a set of Fed indications and then market indications. The Fed's been quite clear about their policy around lifting rates. They've been quite clear about how long, they've been quite clear about inflation targets and kind of general monetary policy planning, and I think that's actually you've got to ascribe a fair amount of reliability to that. And then they're all the market indicators, whether it's the front end of the curve, the steepening, the volatility inherent in some of the curve structure is another indicator that we're very conscious of. And then I've got to say, there's no substitute for doing a running a battery of tests, a battery of stress tests, because you're always worried about what you don't know and what you're not seeing in the marketplaces. And, the good thing about rates markets is we've got 50 years plus of solid history. And we'll do all those tests and then we'll do the theoretical ones. So anyway, it's something we're very careful on, I think is the bottom line. Good, good question Brian. I said a couple of percentage points down, either in the first quarter or second quarter. We think there's a small step down from 4Q to one or the other. It's just really hard because you're always working through what are the headwinds and tailwinds at an inflection point to call the trough. But we think it's sometime in the first half. And we think it's -- we think given what we know today and kind of the market indicators and the assumptions we've shared, we think it's one of those two quarters."

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation. In addition, today’s presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRon O’Hanley: Thank you, Ilene and good morning everyone. We released second quarter results this morning. Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our continued strong financial performance. I am proud of our team members worldwide, who continue to put our clients first and deliver these results for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 3, I will provide a brief update on how we are successfully navigating the COVID-19 operating environment, while also delivering earnings growth for our shareholders. Providing exceptional service quality through improved client engagement, driving product performance, supporting the overall financial system, and safeguarding our workforce are all key priorities for us. We demonstrated success in each of these areas this quarter and delivered strong results for our shareholders as a result. Our clients are at the center of everything we do. You will recall that in 2019 we took a number of actions to improve client service quality, engagement, and decision-making. These measures have led to improved client engagement, which is critically important in the current environment, and its impact is evident in our results and business performance. Our clients are continuing to turn to State Street for our operational capabilities and solutions. During the second quarter, we effectively managed to onboard a number of new client projects across various client segments, including a large asset manager, a significant asset owner, and a national wealth manager in CRD. Indeed, we see true sustainable momentum developing in our Alpha CRD platform. All this occurred while processing 13% and 35% increases in back and middle office transactions, respectively. We were the first service provider to support the launch of the semi-transparent ETF product, and we see strong demand in the market for this innovative solution. Our service quality is being recognized across the industry. For example, we are particularly proud of our ranking in the 2020 Euromoney FX Survey, where State Street was named the number one FX provider to asset managers for the third consecutive year, with a number one ranking in overall customer satisfaction globally. This strong client engagement is reflected in our product performance. Our investment servicing assets under custody administration, which increased 5% quarter-over-quarter to $33.5 trillion, had another healthy level of new wins amounting to $162 billion in the second quarter. Assets yet to be installed stood at a strong $1 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.1 trillion and we recorded $23 billion of total net inflows during the second quarter. Our SPDR range of ETFs recorded its best quarter of inflows since the fourth quarter of 2017, while SPDR GLD, the gold ETF at its strongest ever level of inflows at $12 billion. Further, we are competing and winning in key strategic areas of focus for us. Our recently expanded and re-benchmarked range of low-cost ETFs also recorded its highest quarterly level of inflows at $11 billion. Our sector SPDRs made strong market share gains with almost half of sector industry flows going into the product during the second quarter. And we remain flight to quality for cash management and liquidity solutions across a suite of product options. We continue to play a critical role in supporting the financial system. The operating environment remains uncertain as the pandemic continues to impact many parts of the world. While we have seen a partial recovery in some areas, many economic indicators continue to point negatively and unemployment remains high, reflecting the real human cost of this health crisis. State Street continues to support the broader economy and markets and is actively assisting client access to various Federal Reserve programs that support the flow of liquidity and credit. Currently, State Street is involved in 5 Federal Reserve programs either directly, such as with the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility or as the program’s custodian and administrator, such as the Main Street Lending Facility. Lastly, developing a high-performing organization and planning ahead for our global workforce also continues to be a priority. We continue to have about 90% of our employees working from home as we optimize a work-from-home model while leveraging technology to enable better collaboration and more effective ways to serve our clients. Last quarter, we took – we took measures to protect our employees and announced that through the end of the year we suspended any workforce reductions other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID-19 crisis. Now, we are going further for our employees by increasing their opportunities for mobility by launching an internal talent marketplace. By supporting our employees, as they take on new roles and learn new skills, the marketplace will better develop and redeploy our internal talent to meet our evolving business needs and the growing demands of clients and stakeholders.  Turning to Slide 4 in our second quarter and first half performance highlights, I am pleased by our continued strong performance and the progress we are making toward achieving our medium-term financial goals. Relative to the prior-year period, total revenue increased 2% and fee revenue increased 5%. Second quarter EPS was $1.86, up 31% year-over-year and ROE was 12.1%. I am pleased to report that our second quarter pre-tax margin improved by over 2 percentage points year-over-year to 27%. Our first half pre-tax margin increased by 3 percentage points. The front-to-back Alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients. Our second quarter performance was helped by the strong revenue performance at Charles River development, where we had key business wins and renewals. The Alpha CRD pipeline continues to develop well with a good mix of deal sizes, functionalities, and scope. We expect to be announcing new major wins between now and year end. Turning to expenses, the pandemic created an immediate challenge to our expense reduction planning relative to our original expectations at the start of the year. To help offset this impact, we took immediate action by implementing a hiring freeze, launching the talent marketplace I just referenced and reassessing all discretionary expenses. I am pleased to report that through our continued expense management efforts, further IT optimization, and operational productivity measures, we reduced total expenses by 3% in the second quarter relative to the year ago period. While we continue to invest in our business, first half 2020 expenses are now down 2% net of those investments relative to the year ago period. For us, productivity management is a way of life as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense management we successfully established during 2019 when we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency and reduce expenses through a comprehensive firm-wide expense savings program. We cannot control the economic environment, but we can control our expenses. Despite the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has created, we remain highly focused on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits as we strengthen our operating model and enhance service quality even during this challenging period. Turning to our balance sheet and capital, we are pleased with our 2020 CCAR results and the inaugural determination of our preliminary stress capital buffer at the minimum 2.5% level. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an unprecedented real time stress test and our strong capital position has enabled us to operate effectively, help stabilize the financial markets and support our clients, employees and communities. While the environment remains uncertain, State Street’s performance under the Federal Reserve’s severely adverse scenario is another reminder of our business model’s resiliency and our capital stability. We recently announced our intention to continue our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.52 per share in the third quarter. Consistent with the Federal Reserve’s instructions to all large banks, we will be suspending share repurchases for the third quarter. As we look ahead, given our strong capital position, we will consider a full range of capital actions, including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters. We will of course take into account economic conditions, safety and soundness, the Federal Reserve supplemental CCAR scenarios and review process, our capital levels and any interim regulatory limitations. To conclude, I am very pleased with this quarter’s results, which demonstrates continuing revenue improvement even during difficult times as well as further evidence of our ongoing ability to tightly control expenses while continuing to safeguard our employees and serve our clients. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Let me begin my review of second quarter by summarizing our year-over-year results on the left panel on Slide 5. EPS is up 31%. Revenue is up 2%. Expense is down 3% with expanding margins and healthy ROEs. And I think it is useful to point out that while we continue to operate in an extraordinary environment for the COVID pandemic, our results this quarter shows strong underlying momentum and durability in our State Street operating model. Our bellwether servicing fees are up year-on-year. Our prior investments in our global FX and CRD franchises have yielded strong results. We have been able to carry reserve builds. And throughout all of this, we have continued to drive expenses lower and lower. And so our pre-tax margin is up 2.3 points year-on-year and our ROE is up 2 points. Turning to Slide 6, period end AUC/A levels increased 2% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year move was driven by higher period end market levels and client flows partially offset by previously announced client transition that had a de minimis effect on revenue during the quarter. Quarter-on-quarter, the AUC/A increased, which is partially reported on a lag was mainly due to higher period end equity market levels. AUM levels increased 5% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter to $3.1 trillion driven largely by higher period end market levels and net inflows. Amidst continued in uncertain economic conditions, Global Advisors saw net inflows of $23 billion driven by cash and ETF flows partially offset by institutional outflows. I highlight that our U.S. SPDR ETFs saw another strong quarter with $24 billion of inflows, which was well-diversified once again. As Ron mentioned, our low cost SPDR portfolio ETF saw their largest quarterly inflow yet and continue to gain share. Our commodity ETFs and sector ETFs saw strong inflows too. Moving to Slide 7, servicing fees were up 2% year-on-year reflecting higher client activity and net new business only partially offset by some pricing headwinds, which continue to moderate. Servicing fees were down 1% quarter-on-quarter driven by lower average market levels partially offset by higher client activity. Despite the recovery in equity markets since the first quarter, average domestic and international equity markets were still down sequentially impacting servicing fees. However, client activity remained elevated, so down from March levels as market volatility persisted throughout the quarter. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we have maintained business continuity and continue to provide clients with the benefits of our scale and diverse capabilities. On the bottom right of the panel, we have included again some sales performance indicators that underline this dynamic. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $162 billion in 2Q with several deals coming through. Assets to be installed as of period end 2Q are strong at $1 trillion. We continue to have a strong pipeline of front-to-back Alpha deals and expect multiple Alpha announcements in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other important revenue lines. Beginning with management fees, 2Q revenues decreased 4% year-over-year driven by institutional product outflows and mix partially offset by strong net inflows from both ETF and cash products. With the second quarter now complete and a better sense of the forward rate picture, we now anticipate that the likely impact of money-market fee waivers, net of distribution expense will be at the low end of our previously announced range or just $10 million to $15 million for the full year. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, FX trading services saw another strong quarter, with revenues up 26% year-on-year, but down 25% quarter-on-quarter as the business again saw elevated volumes and increased client demand, but down from the record levels seen in 1Q. The FX trading franchises continued to see market share gains and increased client engagement. As Ron mentioned, we saw strong results across the recently released 2020 Euromoney Survey, securing the number one spot in global customer satisfaction service as well as the number one spot for all products and for electronic trading for our asset manager clients. Security finance revenue decreased 27% year-on-year as they do see lending demand for assets lightens and shift towards lower spread fixed income assets and as ongoing hedge fund de-leveraging in falling markets drove down enhanced custody demand. Securities finance revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter. Finally, software and processing fees increased 46% year-on-year and more than doubled quarter-on-quarter driven by significant revenue-adds of CRD, which I will talk more about shortly and positive outcomes in our market sensitive activity, which includes certain currency translation impacts and marks on employee long-term incentive plans. These other items were positive this quarter in contrast to first quarter when they were notably negative. Moving to Slide 9, CRD generated standalone revenue of $145 million, which was up 59% year-on-year and 45% quarter-on-quarter driven by a large wealth implementation and several large asset manager renewals. We have always talked about the lumpiness inherent in ASC 606 revenue recognition standards. So, while we are extremely pleased with these results, we remind you not to read across any one quarter. Moving to the right hand side of the page, we were quite pleased to see the momentum in CRD this quarter overall and the progress we have made to extend the CRD presence in the wealth segment in particular, which you may recall was one of our key synergy commitments at the time of acquisition. Wealth now represents approximately 20% of CRD revenue and represents another area of growth for us. Turning to Slide 10, NII decreased 9% year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter. Excluding the impact of episodic market benefits of $20 million in the first quarter, NII was down 13% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline in NII was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of lower market rate, including the impact of central bank intervention with more USD liquidity driving lower than expected sponsor repo volumes. We continue to support client’s use of the Federal Reserve’s money market mutual fund liquidity facility. As a result this quarter, MMLF balances averaged $19 billion and finished the quarter at $11 billion. You will see on the left hand side of the slide, this quarter we all are also showing our NIM excluding the impact of the MMLF. While MMLF had a positive impact on NII this quarter, its impact on our NIM was a negative 5 basis points. Average assets increased 13% quarter-on-quarter, an average deposits increased 9% quarter-on-quarter. However, period-end deposits decreased 22% or $57 billion quarter-on-quarter as a portion of the uptick in the deposits we saw at the height of the pandemic receded in the last few months. Given the Fed’s expansion of the money supply, however, we do expect a good portion of the current deposits to stay with us, which we will reinvest in a mix of both loans and securities. Moving to Slide 11, we have again included some color on the loan portfolio as well as the company’s allowance for credit losses. On the top panels of this page, you can see updated detail around our high-quality loan book and its characteristics compared to first quarter average loans decreased 4%, while period-end loans decreased 17% primarily driven by reduction in client overdraft levels we saw during March. Overall, the loan book remains healthy with our largest lending category, capital call financing to private equity funds see no change in borrowing pattern, but with continued strong demand for new facilities. Moving to the bottom panels, the allowance for credit losses increased to $163 million, primarily due to a $52 million in provisions for credit losses driven by changing economic conditions and ratings migration offset by $14 million in net charge-offs. You will note we took advantage of a rally in the leverage loan market to selectively de-risk our leverage loan portfolio and exited certain positions, which effectively cost us $6 million given the necessary reserve bill, so a good trade. On Slide 12, we have again provided a view of expenses this quarter ex-notables so that the underlying trends are readily visible. Our 2Q ‘20 expenses were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, excluding both notable items and seasonal expenses, with favorable trends across most expense categories. As we said last quarter, amidst the ongoing pandemic, we continue to execute on many of the investments and optimization savings initiatives detailed earlier in the year. And while we suspended workforce reductions for year end other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID crisis, we have found additional expense opportunities to act upon. We continue to make progress on lowering compensation benefits costs, occupancy costs and other costs, while IT costs are lumpy, but on track. We are particularly pleased that our results reflected continued and sustainable expense reduction, notwithstanding the extraordinary market conditions, while also delivering top line revenue growth. Moving to Slide 13, on the right, you can see the evolution of CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. We are thus navigating this challenging environment with strong capital levels. In 2Q, our standardized CET1 ratio increased 1.6 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 12.3% driven by solid retained earnings and a reduction in RWAs as market volatility receded. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was essentially flat at 6.1% due to higher capital levels offset by higher deposits. We were also pleased with our 2020 CCAR results. Our capital resilience under the Fed stress scenarios continues to demonstrate our low risk profile. And this year, we received a preliminary stress capital buffer requirement of 2.5%, which would have been much lower if it were not floored at 2.5%. As you know, the Fed has had large banks to suspend share buybacks in third quarter. However, we expect to continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share. And finally, as Ron noted, the firm’s capital position remains strong amidst the uncertainty created in the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we will consider a full range of capital actions, including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters, but we will do so considering economic conditions, safety and soundness, the Fed’s supplemental CCAR scenarios and review process, our capital levels and then the interim regulatory limitations. Turning to Slide 14, we have again provided a summary of our 2Q results. As we mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results and believe they are a reflection of the durability and resiliency of State Street’s business model as well as our focus on delivering on our strategy of both growth and productivity. Throughout this crisis, we have differentiated ourselves by proactively reaching out and assisting clients through these difficult times. We believe that our resiliency during this extraordinary period and our constant attention to service quality has created goodwill with our clients and positioned us for share gains over the medium to long-term. Last quarter, I outlined our full year financial outlook under a certain set of assumptions, noting that there was a range of possibilities as a result of the potential length of the COVID pandemic and the associated economic impacts. I would like to update those expectations with our current thinking, again, noting there remain a broad range of possible outcomes. We now expect global central banks will keep short rates at current levels for the remainder of the year and long end rates will stay at a June 30 spot rates through year end. We also now assume that average global equity markets levels for the remainder of 2020 will be flat to current levels. As a result of our client engagements, moderating pricing pressure and CRD and Alpha front-to-back wins, we now expect that full year fee revenue will no longer be down 1% to 2% year-on-year for the full year 2020, but instead will be up approximately 1.5% to 2% with servicing fees expect to show a year-over-year improvement relative to 2019. Regarding NII given the impact of continued lower long end rates on the investment portfolio and central bank intervention with more USD liquidity driving down the expected repo volumes, we now expect NII to be down approximately 9% to 11% on a sequential quarter basis and expect the fourth quarter to be relatively in line with the coming third quarter. Turning to expenses, we remain laser focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and achieving automation benefits. We expect that full year expenses will now be down at the better end of our previous guide of down 1% to 2% year-on-year, excluding notable items as we continue to find ways to control and drive down expenses. In regards to our provision for credit losses, we continue to see a range of outcomes based on evolving economic conditions and any ratings migrations. On taxes, we expect our tax rate for the full year to be closer to the lower end of our 17% to 19% range. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRon O’Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Operator, can you open the call to questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric, if you could just unpack a little bit the NII guide just in terms of what you are seeing for client deposit levels moving into 3Q, and to what extent your guidance for 3Q and 4Q includes more reinvestment or more shift of deposits into longer term securities? I am sorry, also one more on that is the repo financing business in terms of the impact, it looks like that was much lighter in the second quarter, so just your thoughts on that for the second half as well?\nRon O’Hanley: Eric, you are muted.\nEric Aboaf: Brian it’s Eric. Thanks for the question. We are clearly navigating through some challenging times with the interest rate environment and obviously trying to do our best to navigate through. When you think about the NII guide, there is clearly the continued downtick in long-term rates, which is affecting the investment portfolio, and we will continue to some extent in the coming quarters after that. And then there is lower volume sequentially and overdraft and then the MMLF balances that are also contributing to that – to the second quarter to third quarter decline. I think once we get to that level, part of what happens is that you have got offsetting factors, you have got on one hand the lower long end rates which put up -- which tend to tractor through the investment portfolio for another couple of quarters, which creates a downdraft. And those I think can be offset by the growth in the investment portfolio and lending base, which is really supported by the higher levels of deposits that we are operating at. Now, it’s hard to tell exactly what the deposit levels are going to be, but I think if you stare at the data that we have shown here, you know, we used to run at $155 billion to $160 billion of deposits. First quarter average was solidly at $180 billion. Second quarter averages solidly at $197 billion. We think we are going to land somewhere between those two points, which means that off of the original base as, call it $160 billion of deposits, there is an ability to expand the investment portfolio put on duration carefully and selectively invest in some high-quality position to maintain our HQLA, and we think that together should create some stability on NII in the coming quarters. The sponsored repo program, as you mentioned, did create a downdraft from 1Q to 2Q. And what we are seeing there is that the overnight repo rates are less attractive then they have been relative to 1-month treasury rates, and so that creates reduction in volumes. If that were to persist, then we are not going to get a lift there and we are not going to get the volumes we would like to see. On the other hand, if that normalizes back, there could be some upside in the coming quarters, but more time will tell before we can incorporate that into our forecast.\nBrian Bedell: Okay, great. That’s super helpful. And then maybe on CRD, you had a very strong quarter, very encouraging on the wealth management wins, maybe just a two-part question, Eric, on the revenue trajectory, obviously, it’s lumpy like you said, maybe if you can just try to characterize what you thought was one-time licensing fee revenue within the second quarter? And then maybe Ron, if you want to talk a little bit about that wealth strategy, it sounds very encouraging in terms of the win that you have announced and potential new wins down the road? And maybe just in terms of sizing that space for you, what you are doing there on the wealth side that’s different than the institutional asset manager side at CRD?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, Brian, why don’t I start and then I’ll turn it over to Eric. So I will start on the latter part of your question there. As we mentioned, when we acquired Charles River in addition to its core institutional client segment, it developed a fair amount of technology applicable to the wealth segment, particularly the larger wealth manager segment, large private wealth managers, warehouses, etcetera. And that is -- we have continued that R&D and also leveraged our own client relationships to be able to help propel that growth, and that’s what you are seeing playing through. We see it as a solid and additional form of growth on top of the core institutional business. Right now, I think it’s about 20% of the business, up significantly from when we acquired it and we would expect it to be growing probably a little bit more than the – at a slightly higher level than the institutional business. And the good news about this is that it shares the same technology and operating platform. I mean, there are certain sub applications that are different, but we can do this at scale easily. And the way I would say you should think about the lumpiness, I mean, Eric, will take you through the how the accounting actually works, but when you start to see kind of positive lumpiness like this, I mean, it’s essentially a client being installed, and it’s at the point then that we can start to recognize revenue and following that will be ongoing recurring fee. So, that’s how you should interpret the lumpiness. It’s not necessary. It is one-time as it relates to that client, but it’s certainly not one time as we continue to grow. You will see that same kind of lumpiness.\nEric Aboaf: Brian, let me add some texture and even some numbers to that so that you can get a better sense of the underlying revenues here. And we are quite pleased with the growth trajectory. We are quite pleased with the pipeline with kind of contracted, but not yet installed levels. We track a number of different metrics here to give us confidence in the developing growth. The revenues really come, I will call it, broadly into two buckets. There is SaaS revenues and professional services. And SaaS revenues are pretty straightforward, you win a client, it’s a 5-year contract and the revenue recognition is that the revenue is ratably applied over those five years, very straight forward. And in fact, we want to be in the business of growing SaaS revenues over time and professional services because those create a very regular and recurring set of revenues. The second part of the revenues comes from on-premise installations, and we have a number of clients who’ve had on-premise installations and even some who continue to prefer them. And in those cases, the revenue recognition comes in two parts. You have an upfront piece, which could be in the range of around 60% of the contract. And then you have the balance, call it 40% in the example I have given you, which could be ratably over the contract length, if that were say a four- or five-year contract, and so you get a piece and then you get a trail behind that. So those are the two big pieces.  When we look at the revenue numbers that we showed you on page nine, you go back what we want to be doing, we want to be growing both pieces to be honest and in particular, the regular. The first one, the very recurring revenue base, if you go back on Page 9 and you look at the data that we showed around revenues, back in the second quarter of 2019, we had $91 million of revenues, about 65% of that was in SaaS and professional fees. And so it gives you a sense for the kind of the relative amount if you go quarter over quarter of this year, those recurring SaaS and professional fee revenues were just over $80 million. But we see both, we see nice growth, year on year, and in fact, it’s happened consistently over the five quarters, and then the balance of the 145 is been more in the on-premise kind of revenue installations where you get a good sized piece up front, but then the recurring piece in the future. And I think if you step back with that kind of revenue recognition, where we are focused on growing client and client engagements and some clients are delighted to be on the Saas platform and we have seen consistent growth there. So that gives us some confidence in the kind of the, the, the completely recurring base, and then you have the more on-prem kind of revenues which start off with a piece, they then have a trail. Alright, and then when the contract ends, you get another piece in the that’s lumpy, and then in a trail after that, and that’s just the nature of the beast of how, how the revenue recognition works all in. we are quite pleased with this revenue trajectory the backlog the contracted but not yet installed and the sales performance and so while you see some lumpiness, it is we are seeing good underlying metrics as well.\nBrian Bedell: That’s great color and a lot of detail. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nRon O’Hanley: Good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I wanted to understand a little bit on the expense side. I know you called out, improvement there in part from things like market data, which is, really impressive given that market data cost for most, participants is moving higher and higher every quarter. So just want to get a little bit of color on that and on the sub-custody savings and to what degree is there, more legs there and that, specific line item in your expenses?\nEric Aboaf: Betsy, it’s Eric. Both of those are sizable expense categories, they both are part of the transaction processing line item that we report. And, what we found is that we need to just actively manage those, sub-custody is something that that we need provided to us. And so, we’ve worked with some of the largest banks, as well as some of the, country banks to find the best mix of service at a declining cost level, in our view that is something we need to keep doing year after year. And we have been able to deliver I think, some good savings this year and our expectation is to continue that trajectory. Market data is a little more complicated to your point is that there is a of market data ingestion that is possible. And what we found is that we need to both manage the ingestion pipes, because if we secure market data in too many different pipes, then we end up buying more than we need. We also need to find vendors. And over the last couple of quarters, we have started to really work more closely with several of our vendors around who gives us the best cost and pricing kind of quality levels. And that’s also been factored in. And then there is a third piece to be honest on market data, which I find helpful from a client standpoint to be honest, which is some of our market data costs are borne by us, which we want to drive down, but with the right quality and others, market data costs are sometimes borne with our buyer clients. And we are in many cases working with our vendors against both pools of market data to try to secure the best results for them as well. So, lots of activity there. What I would tell you is that some of what you see on that transaction processing line is the result of some intense focus on those areas. And it’s actually a bit of an example of what we are doing in other areas. We talked about starting to drive our technology costs down. And so we are doing similar work on hardware costs and hardware vendors working with them in a more active way. We are doing that in software and maintenance contracts from the technology side. And so it’s really become an expanding, I will call it expertise, but sort of partnerships and approaches that we have taken I think to good effect, but to be honest one that we need to repeat year after year to get the benefits that we would like to help drive our expanding margins.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And so you have got some more legs there is the nut of that answer. And I appreciate all the color. It’s interesting especially with the client side of it. The follow-up I have for you, Eric, is regarding the net interest income, net interest margin outlook and I know you have a 9% to 11% down 2Q and 3Q and then stabilization into 4, maybe you could give us some color on the assumptions around the four key stabilizations, what has to happen for that to come through?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. The 4Q stabilization is really driven by I think the economic kind of the interest rate environment first and foremost. So we are assuming short-end rates stays more or less where they are and we are assuming long-end rates stay more or less where they are. You know, the forwards always have some expansion and increase and I think we have gotten a little gun shy about always planning for those. And so we feel like we should plan at the current levels. So that’s the first part of the assumption base. I think the second part of the assumption base is that there is some normalization deposits, but as I have said, I think we have got a nice chunk there that we can begin to think of this, whether we are confident, are stickier. And it depends on the speed of our reinvestment in the investment portfolio into some asset classes that we are comfortable with. And I think that will factor in as well.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, alright. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks. Quick follow-up question on the expense side, I heard your overall comments. So that’s what matters most. But within this quarter’s 3.3% dropdown, 40% of the reduction expenses was lower marketing and travel, I am assuming that’s the product of the environment. So how much of that is sustainable or works its way back and again, I appreciate that’s probably part of your overall expense comment?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, Glenn, that’s fair, because as you just – as you know, we are trying to find sustainable expense reductions this year and then into next year. And if we just brought them down and they pop back up, that doesn’t count neither for our shareholders nor for us. There aren’t some tailwinds of travel expenses and even some medical benefit claims, you know, are lighter in the expense trends, but remember, there is also some headwinds that we would have are actions in areas where we would have driven expenses down that we weren’t able to. And so as the biggest simple example is the pause on layoffs because of the pandemic, that would have been worth at least half a point of expense reduction, if not a little more, for every quarter this year and on a full year basis. And I think what we are going to have to do next year is go back to what we have been doing driving down all of our costs or compensation benefit costs, where we will be able to now action that and continue to drive-down third-party spend costs as well. And so I think we are – I think the trends will line up, there are just going to be some ins and outs or headwinds and tailwinds at any point, but we see a path to continue doing what we are doing, which is to drive expenses lower and lower year after year.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay, I appreciate that. And then during the quarter, you announced a venture with FNZ on servicing and the wealth management space. I am curious if you could talk a little bit about what the target of that venture is, they seem to have a really strong operation in Europe, what you bring to the table, what they bring to the table that will be great? Thanks.\nRon O’Hanley: Hey, Glenn, It’s Ron. So FNZ has a very strong operating platform. It’s target market is certainly in the U.S. would be the smaller end or a lower end in terms of size of market segment than we do in Charles River and CRD. So, it’s quite complimentary to what we do. We would also – we would be their custodian and administrator as they move into that space. So, we view it as a way to expand into even further into wealth, a segment that we wouldn’t naturally have leading capabilities in number one. Number two, they have got some really interesting technology that we want to continue to figure out how we can use elsewhere. So it’s a way of getting some technology leadership that as well as a revenue stream at a relatively low cost for us.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay, thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I would like to follow-up on the Charles River commentary and the front-end fees versus that trail – and the trail dynamic. It sounds like that’s a little less than half of this quarter’s revenue. So wanted to confirm that’s the case? And then is the on-boarding, you know, the installed the front end, is that a multiple quarter dynamic or is that a single dynamic? How does the trailer in those arrangements compared to the upfront? So, how should we think about the continuing revenue dynamic? And then how long are those contracts? And what’s the typical retention rate? I just would love to get a better dimension for the cadence of those revenues if you can provide some of that? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Brennan, it’s Eric. It’s fair to get into the details, because the details do matter. But as we do that, let me remind you, there is a range of details. And so let me try to answer the question that we can certainly follow-up with you and other investors that are curious, but this is a bit of the bankers working in a software space, which just operates in a different cadence with ASC 606. First, the recurring revenues, the SaaS kind of implementations are pretty straightforward. And I think I gave the numbers there. And I think you have got the right mix. The mix in each of these quarters has always been much more kind of SaaS professional services, the completely, I will call it completely stable revenues and those have been building nicely. And I think we are quite pleased with that trajectory. On the lumpier part of the revenues which is the on-prem – on-premise installations, the answer is there is a range of different situations, which have to do with different contract length. And so let me just give you a sense, contract lengths can range from call it 3 years to 8 years, right. And for those kinds of ranges, then you tend to get on 3-year contracts, you might get 70% upfront and then the other 30% over the rest of the 3 years comes in kind of year by year by year or quarter by quarter by quarter the effect or for something like that 7 or 8 year contract you will tend to get about 50% in the first year and then the other 50% in those 7 or 8 years ratably. And so there is a range, but I think it’s I don’t know it’s contemplated to measure the revenues in a reasonable way. And you will have to talk with them if you like it or not, I can’t really opine there, but that’s the range. The upfront piece comes in, in a particular quarter and why is that because that’s when the system literally goes live and it’s beginning to serve clients. So, it becomes in service and it’s the quarters after that through the length of the contract that you ratably see the rest of the revenues. What I do want to remind folks though is that once we have a client, the client retention in our business are very, very high. We retain most of our clients. And so, on a 3-year contract, you will the description that I just gave of 70% plus of 30% over the trail, 3 years later gets repeated, right? Same for a 5-year contract, 5 years out. And so in a way, we are little hesitant when people casually say, well, that’s one-time it’s not really one time, right, it’s there is a good piece upfront, there is a good piece reasonably process that we have secured. And then there is almost always the extension, which brings the same thing again, it’s just that it’s a little lumpier than that we would all like. So maybe I will pause there, but happy to talk more at the right time.\nBrennan Hawken: Well, one more piece of my question, I think that you might have forgotten, Eric, is the retention rate, what’s the historical retention rate on those 3-year rates?\nEric Aboaf: We can, I think it’s very high. Why don’t we – why don’t we do a little follow-up and get that out to you in a Reg FD.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay.\nEric Aboaf: But it’s – we have been with part of our diligence of retention rates. Before I quote a precise number, let me come back to you, but it’s very, very high.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes.\nEric Aboaf: It’s something that gives us a lot of confidence, because remember, once you have an on-premise installation like you have invested a lot internally as become a client side to integrate it with your state, with your other systems and subsystems. And so there is a willingness and there is an ability which together result in very, very strong, very high renewal rates.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes, okay.\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, Brennan, it’s Ron. Maybe just to reinforce why that is, I mean, typically what goes on in these conversions is there is a pretty big and significant operating model change that goes on at the asset manager or the wealth manager. So typically, a new client is not that we are displacing somebody like Aladdin. Typically, it’s a client that’s got a bunch of bespoke and scattered technology. And they are moving to a comprehensive kind of system like this. So that’s why you get very, very high retention rates, because frankly the switching costs on the client side are pretty high.\nBrennan Hawken: Got it. Thank you for that. Appreciate all that color, Ron and Eric. And then following up on, you gave some great color and expenses. And I understand it’s really hard to be too granular, Eric, to your point in the unusual operating environment that we are in, but I am going to give something a shot anyway. Have you reviewed your real estate footprint? Boston is a fairly expensive city. And when you look at your website, it seems like you have three different offices in the city. Is that really the optimal footprint based upon the experience that we have been seeing here, early read on the pandemic and the shutdown? Have you rethought the potential for remote or distributed workplace arrangements? How much do you think you can compress your occupancy expense over the next few years on the back of some of that?\nEric Aboaf: Brennan, it’s Eric. Let me start on that to give you a little bit of kind of near-in views and Ron may play in as well. And in fact, I might ask your CFO the same question, when I see him next, because I think every CFO out there not just bank CFOs is wrestling with this specific question. Here at State Street, we have occupancy expense of about $435 million bucks. And we had already plans to drive it down this year by about 5%. So, taking a chunk out of that, and part of that is continued gratification of our high cost, location footprint, and taking advantage at the same time as some of the productivity, right, think both from the headcount management that we have done around the world as well. I think, I think in the very near term a couple things happen in real estate one is we just don’t add any real estate and Ron and I put immediate halt. As soon as this pandemic happens, let me tell you, there’s no, there’s no that a halt is, is perpetual practically. If then, it does have a little bit of an effect where we can easily sublease. So, now what we are doing is going back to every lease that we have, and literally going through and asked him the question, when does it roll over? The question that it really wrestles through is what kind of occupancy rate can you operate add? And if you know most of us have operated at the – call it 85% to 95% occupancy rate. And I think what this pandemic has demonstrated is that the tools and the capabilities through technology and the methods that we have in a company, if we can, we can drive occupancy rates up to we are originally planning to 130%, 140% just by thinking about people’s historic approaches to being in the office or not and I think that, that is kind of what gives us the view that, if we originally saw we could get to 120% occupancy rates. And now with a pandemic, we are confident, we could get to 150%. That’s how you start to get some real leverage on the occupancy costs. I think the one thing that gets in the way of that and I am thinking of various kind of financial lens and we have to think about our people, our teams, our clients, and all the interactions and all that they do is we also need to be respectful of some of the social distancing requirements in the immediate term. And so I think what we have is we have a periods right now where, work from home is 90%, let’s say, with social distancing, we can bring a certain number in. At some point, there is a vaccine. So the social distancing may not be at the same level as it is now and we have a whole group of employees who have learned to operate incredibly effectively work from home, some of whom prefer to be home. And so I think I think there is a lot to do here is I get the summary. I tell you we are already driving down occupancy costs. And I think the question that we will come back to in the coming quarters and in the coming year is how much more, it’s not that they can’t that they won’t come down, they will come down. I think it’s a question of scale off of that base of expense that I circled upfront.\nRon O’Hanley: Yes. Brennan, it’s Ron. What I would add to that is in a fairly short period of time, we have gone through three kind of phases of work. Work from home was about a 1 week event for us and we got 90% of the people out of the buildings and into a home environment. We started about 3 weeks after that planning the return to office, which is in Asia-Pacific as you can imagine where it started back, also parts of Europe slower and you for all the reasons that we know. We have also launched the third phase of this, which is what we are calling the workplace of the future, which is encompasses a lot of things that Eric is talking about. To your point on Boston, as we had announced earlier, we are – we announced late last year that we are vacating this headquarters tower at the end of ‘22 going to move to a new building in Boston, but it’s much more flexible, better terms, lower amount of space. And it’s early enough now that we have ability to customize that even further given what we know about COVID-19. So, again, I don’t believe that we could operate or should operate anything near 90% work from home, but we can operate in a much more flexible basis with work from home being an integral part of what we do it’s certainly part of our disaster recovery now so you should start to see if shedding disaster recovery spaces, too. And you should expect and hold those two are a much lower for foot prints are really starting quite soon. \nBrennan Hawken: That’s great, Eric and Ron, thanks for the color and of course, Eric happy to line up the discussion with my CFO, he can give you tips on how to deal with my annoying questions.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Brennan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Kenneth Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKenneth Usdin: Thanks. Good morning guys. Eric I was wondering if you give us a little bit more color underneath your full year fee outlook and I know given that you have got the CRD comments you talked about then and ask transaction activity but can you kind of walk us through how you are now seeing the bigger buckets move both sequentially and year over year given that we see average asset pricing we have in your earlier comments about the income pressure moderating? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Sure, Ken. Part of the reason we gave an overall fee guide is that there is always are and always going be some ins and outs in that in the various fees I think if you think about the different buckets the texture that I give against the full year guide 1.5% to 2% first on servicing fees I think we feel positive we’ve delivered year on year growth in servicing fees now for the first quarter year on year and then the second quarter year on year and we think that will be a positive for the year and that’s different I contrast that to previous years where we had more fee headwinds or where we didn’t feel like we have the performance we would alike but we think servicing fees will be positive and that’s without an average equity market uptick really because globally equity markets are kind of in a more flattish range management fees I think are doing well we have been a little more negative there we would like to do a little bit better than what we have done FX trading and then all the electronic services around that will be a clear positive FX lending a little lighter as we described some of the shift there but area that we are working on and then in the software and processing fees I think we are quite confident on the Charles river momentum especially with some of the recent win and then there is a kind of the there are some other in that line there are some other business activity or loan fees or other software fees etcetera then there’s some of the lumpy stuff that we have to just take in Mark so all in all though full year 1.5% to 2% is what we see today. Which is I think it gives us the positive momentum that we live and then something to build on for next year and our view is if we can drive even low single digit fees upwards and continue to drive expenses down we are getting the right results.\nKenneth Usdin: Yes. And one big picture one for Ron. Ron last quarter you talked about that a little bit of a push off in either installations and client discussions because of just everything that we are dealing with your win rate in servicing was about flat can you talk and you talked about the potential wins in the CRD side wealth management platform can you just talk about just the conversations that are happening now and how that’s evolving just in terms of the core business and any sense that’s starting to open up at all. \nRon O’Hanley: Yes, Kenneth. As we talked about last quarter we said that it was our sense that just given the additional challenges post to asset managers and asset owners operating models of COVID-19 but we thought that we would see even at some point an increase in conversations an interest in outsourcing and operating model changes in general and that’s actually started to happen and was started to happen in a big way in the second quarter so we see continued interest in not just movement of back office to the lowest price much more about how do we comprehensively improve – how do we – the asset owner or asset manager comprehensively improved our operating model through changes to their back office, and even to their front office. So that’s continuing. And it’s we have, as I noted in my opening remarks as a result of that, we would expect to see and be in a position to announce some significant new wins between now and the end of the year. That are some combination of front, middle and back office of notable names.\nKenneth Usdin: Got it. Thank you, Ron.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, thanks guys. Good morning, Ronald and Eric. So, should maybe just building on the last comment, I wanted to big into share it a little bit more. As you think about the pipeline and CRD and sort of this sizable implementation opportunity you guys see, what percentage of that is the on premise versus kind of the SASB type of contract? And then secondly, I was hoping you guys could begin into the shared the wealth strategy a little bit broadly, thanks for some of the added disclosure there. But what kind of the – what are the typical sort of clients in the wealth management space that are warehouses is it a independent broker dealers and RIA. So, just a little bit more flavor there and which one of these channels incremental growth has been coming from? Thanks.\nRon O’Hanley: Why don’t I start there? Eric can talk about the mix, Alex, but on the wealth channel, it tends to be the higher – the larger wealth managers. And it’s a combination if I think about both, what’s installed this quarter, but also what’s – where we have conversations and we will be installing a future quarters. It’s a combination of the warehouses and that obviously comes with lots of seats, as you would imagine, but also the larger private wealth managers, I mean, they could be RIAs, but again, it tends to be the larger ones and the larger names. And if you think why that is, oftentimes they are bringing, these institutions are bringing some fairly significant asset allocation capability to bear. And while they want to give their advisors, some freedom to customize, they also want to have a lot of control over that. And the CRD platform works really well. And in that regard. And as I mentioned, in response to an earlier question, the great thing for us is that this, it’s it, it certainly is a bespoke application for the wealth segment, but it’s leveraging, much of the same underlying technology. So there’s a lot of scale and all this both in terms of the initial development we have done but also as we, as we roll out software improvements.\nEric Aboaf: And Alex, just have round out on the financial fleet, we had a range of implementations of this quarter on the on premise side, that ones that are lumpier. The range was 3 years to 8 years. And it actually runs the gamut of 50% to 70% in the first year and then the balance ratably. I think the largest of implementations was that’s going to be on the close to 8-year mark, which would be 50% in the first year and the other 50% in the coming year – in the coming years.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Thanks. And then just maybe to round up the discussion around NIR, so Eric, your comment around kind of stabilizing NIR towards the end of the year, because that already contemplates significant reinvestment of liquidity that you guys have build up on the balance sheet into securities and loans or with a little more reinvest into ‘21? Could we maybe even see a little bit of growth from that sort of trough level of net interest revenues? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yes, Alex, it’s little early to get into 2021 to be honest, but with the guide I gave for 4Q does contemplate some reinvestment in the investment portfolio. And we are just kind of driving the balance both the long end range do have a kind of a tale of effects for us. And so in a way this is the time for us to add to the investment portfolio and do our work to offset what would naturally be a downward headwind, but I think we are – we have got a path. It’s just – it’s hard to see growth in NII at this point. We are both what we see a path to relative stability within a range, but it’s going to take some work. And, we don’t really know what happens with rates and how they evolve. But, we can we can see a path there.\nAlex Blostein: Yes, that makes us. Thanks very much.\nEric Aboaf: Yes\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Morning, Ron. Good morning Eric.\nRon O’Hanley: Good morning.\nEric Aboaf: Morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Ron, can you follow up on the new wins that you guys gave us this quarter? And you mentioned in your comments about the stickiness of not losing customers, and the wins primarily coming from existing customers where you are adding more products and services and in the cases where you win a new customer? I think you alluded to the lower prices, but can you share with us is it price driven that the new customers are coming over or are there are combination of price and better products that you are offering them?\nRon O’Hanley: That’s right. I don’t remember referring to lower pricing and in the context of the wins, But to answer your questions, it’s a mix that we are seeing and right now I’m referring to the, what we call our alpha front to back platform in Charles River. It’s a mix of, existing clients or new clients that we are seeing. And that’s particularly true. As I look at the near-term, pipeline. So in for those existing clients, in effect, we are expanding our share of activity with them to use the vernacular expanding the wallet where we might historically have had a back office custody relationship. And we’re moving to the middle of the funnel of this but beyond that, in the, kind of more traditional core business, we continue to see a fair amount of outsourcing there too firms that had historically done everything but custody inside where we might have been one or, or the only custodian or we are now reconsidering that and moving things like fund accounting out. Middle office would be another big part of that because in fact, our middle office business is the outsourcing of their back office and that solves lots of challenges for them, and we have learned how to scale that business. So that would give you a sense of all that. I mean, what has been pleasing about the pipeline as it’s developed and again, given the comprehensive nature of what we do, these pipelines do take a while to move from when there’s the first contact to the actual signing of the business, but what’s pleasing about that is we are seeing a fair number of new clients there to us, and the, the attractive thing about that is to really get the full advantage of the front to back platform. We are able to show that, we can do the Charles River in middle office for you, but we are going to get real data advantages is having the full front to back. So it fuels growth in our traditional back office business.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then Eric I know it’s not as material to your business as a traditional bank, but your loan portfolio you mentioned you exited some of the leverage loans. Two questions one, can you give us any color on the industries in which you do risk the balance sheet for him? And second, what kind of pricing. Did you see when you sold those leveraged loans? Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Sure, Gerard. We are trying to be proactive here, right. The leveraged loan market has really moved up and down and a good day. And just finding some points where it might make sense. We de risked roughly about $160 million of balances of leveraged loans. I remember, one of the cinema chains was in that and we got out at a good price. I think the average pricing on the exits was around, I think around $0.92 I want to say, on the $1, so somewhere in that range, so we feel like we made some, good tactical decisions. It didn’t cost us that much, because we would have had to build the reserve anyway for those. And that’s why I said on that $160 million in cost that’s effectively a net fix. But for the peace of mind and just trying to be careful because we are a trust and custody bank and that’s our brand, we felt like it was a good trade and we will continue to selectively do that. But in truth, we feel quite good about this loan book. I mean, it’s a most leveraged loans are in the indices are single B and below are the double B and sometimes even better. And so I think we are pretty confident here, but there is always something and we just – we are happy to be proactive and make some tactical decisions and that’s what we did.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMike Mayo: Hi. So, you are guiding for better fee growth for this year, 1.5% to 2% versus down before, how much of that is already reflected in the first half results and how much should be coming in the second half? You mentioned servicing fees, management fees FX processing, but is this mostly reflecting what you have done already or is it mostly to calm? And as a subcomponent of that when it comes to CRD, I guess linked quarter revenues were up $45 million and pre-tax was up $42 million. So I guess that’s about a 93% incremental profit margin. So that leads me to ask, are there some upfront revenues with the new business wins and in terms of timing between the revenues and the expenses, how does that work out? And then lastly, if I can throw it in there, you are going to be a client of CRD and how is that moving along back?\nEric Aboaf: Sure, Mike. It’s Eric. Let me take the first couple and then I think Ron will probably want to take the third. In terms of the full year guide, you are right, there is a number of different pieces to it. There was some pieces of the full year, 1.5% to 2% fee revenue guide that are driven by the first half of the year. And there is some that will be driven by I think continued progress in the second half. I think if you just go through the line items, servicing fees has been good for the first half and we expect them to continue to be good, but I that will be a continued story. Management fees largely because of market, I think a little lighter in the first half, we are hoping that they come in a little stronger on a year-on-year basis in the second half, FX obviously a first half story where the second half will not be there. Sec finance has been light for us in the first half. We are hoping for some and looking for some stability there and some sequential – some sequential stability, if not some little bit of uptick. And then you have Charles River where we obviously got a big part in the second quarter but – and that maybe end up being a little more first half weighted, but I think you are – you typically get performance in the fourth quarter of these software businesses, but we will see I think some activity there. So, a little bit of a mix, to be honest. On Charles River, the good question on the on-premise installation, in particular or the renewals, but I think it’s really on a kind of combination of the new implementations. You do get some professional servicing fees where we build revenues and we incur expenses. And my recollection is those are fairly aligned, the accounting centers encourage us to do that. But there – I think the professional services tend to be billed as incurred. And then – and part of what I described is the more stable part of the revenues. And what we are finding is there is just there is professional services installation work that we do for kind of coming clients, clients that are not yet implemented, but are on their way to implementation. There is some during the implementation that last sprint and then there is clients behind that. So it’s a bit of a mix to be honest, but something we can try to parse out a little more detail in future conferences or calls.\nRon O’Hanley: And Mike regarding, the last part of your question, which is State Street Global Advisors becoming a client of Charles River, they are actually becoming a client of of the full Alpha front-to-back platform, including Charles River. So it’s a fairly comprehensive installments, it’s underway. Alright. It’s the inflation is happening.\nMike Mayo: What – because you are going to be like that will be a nice showcase once you get that done as you say and we use that ourselves, you should use it too, kind of what inning are you in as far as implementing it internally?\nRon O’Hanley: I mean, I am somewhat speculating here now, but we are well over half installed is the way I would describe it. And again, it’s not just installing Charles River, but it’s moving the State Street Global Advisors back office to our middle office platform. It’s accommodating some existing technology that they have in place too. So as you would imagine, it’s a $3.1 trillion asset manager, it’s pretty complicated, but it’s well over halfway to one. And just one last clarification, Eric, so the CRD revenue, should we $145 million in the second quarter, I know this is going to be pretty granular, but is that coming that’s kind of lumpy or were you not – we should extrapolate that out or how should we think about that?\nEric Aboaf: No, it’s lumpy. And Mike, that’s why I was trying to give a little bit of color, but just to reaffirm, in that $145 million, we said they are kind of very recurring literally kind of recurring revenues of just over $80 million and then the balance is in the kind of lumpy category where you get these on-premise installations. I also – so you kind of have to take a piece of the lumpy and say there is always going to be lumpy, because we have 3-year contracts, 5-year contracts, 8-year contracts. And every quarter, every year, there is some of those contracts rollover. And so you are going to get a new lumpiness or you get new business that you add in the lumpy category. I also gave if you want another quarter as a contrast back a year ago, second quarter of ‘19 we have $90 million of total revenues. And I said we had about $65 million of the very kind of recurring SaaS and professional services revenues. And just a smaller piece of that was lumpy. So you can kind of think I think draw some lines and say the lumpiness – this is big lumpy, that’s for sure, but there is only going to be some, but I think – I think hopefully I have given you enough on the kind of SaaS and professional services to let you extrapolate from there and then put in something in the models on the on the lumpy part.\nMike Mayo: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good morning. Maybe just we could talk a little bit a question on the new business wins you have had and the cadence and impact. If I look at new business to be installed, you have about a $1 trillion to go. That’s been pretty stable since the big wins in 3Q 09s, I mean, 19s. So is it on these bigger wins? Does it just really take this long? Is there something unusual here and I guess going forward with the new business wins you have alluded to in the second half this year, is it a similar kind of time to install?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, Jim, it’s a good question. The – when you see this kind of to be installed backlog if you will, that typically reflects that there is multiple tranches of business. So, for example, it could be custody and fund accounting in middle office. And a custody conversion we can do very quickly, right. We have – we literally did some we were notified by a client that they wanted to move in the midst of the crisis. And we got it done intra-quarter, those moves quickly. And so oftentimes don’t even show up in this backlog here. I mean, they would if it was carrying over to a quarter. What you are seeing here is clients, including some very large clients that have multiple tranches of business that they are either moving over from an existing provider or in some cases moving from an in-source to an outsource model. And again, that reflects the nature of our business. We are using our ability to do these kinds of outsourcing to actually drive not just the outsource business, but not to drive traditional core custody, which scales easily and is quite profitable to us. But that’s how you should think about that is that in any given quarter, our new business wins will be some very traditional custody to custody kinds of things or fund accounting to fund accounting. But oftentimes, the backlog reflects it was much more comprehensive kinds of moves.\nJim Mitchell: Right. And should we assume that those more complex deals have higher fee rate? Should we see a little bit more of a material impact on servicing fees when they close?\nRon O’Hanley: Well, what you should expect to see is that there is fees coming from more than one source right, the custody fee, fund accounting fee and middle office fee etcetera. So, that’s how you should think about it.\nJim Mitchell: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja to JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRon O’Hanley: Vivek, we can’t hear you.\nOperator: Vivek, if you are on mute, please un-mute.\nRon O’Hanley: Are you there, Vivek?\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Ron O’Hanley for closing remarks.\nRon O’Hanley: Well, thank you operator and thanks to all of you on the call, who joined us. Thanks for the questions and we look forward to the follow-up.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ron O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene and good morning everyone. We released second quarter results this morning. Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our continued strong financial performance. I am proud of our team members worldwide, who continue to put our clients first and deliver these results for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 3, I will provide a brief update on how we are successfully navigating the COVID-19 operating environment, while also delivering earnings growth for our shareholders. Providing exceptional service quality through improved client engagement, driving product performance, supporting the overall financial system, and safeguarding our workforce are all key priorities for us. We demonstrated success in each of these areas this quarter and delivered strong results for our shareholders as a result. Our clients are at the center of everything we do. You will recall that in 2019 we took a number of actions to improve client service quality, engagement, and decision-making. These measures have led to improved client engagement, which is critically important in the current environment, and its impact is evident in our results and business performance. Our clients are continuing to turn to State Street for our operational capabilities and solutions. During the second quarter, we effectively managed to onboard a number of new client projects across various client segments, including a large asset manager, a significant asset owner, and a national wealth manager in CRD. Indeed, we see true sustainable momentum developing in our Alpha CRD platform. All this occurred while processing 13% and 35% increases in back and middle office transactions, respectively. We were the first service provider to support the launch of the semi-transparent ETF product, and we see strong demand in the market for this innovative solution. Our service quality is being recognized across the industry. For example, we are particularly proud of our ranking in the 2020 Euromoney FX Survey, where State Street was named the number one FX provider to asset managers for the third consecutive year, with a number one ranking in overall customer satisfaction globally. This strong client engagement is reflected in our product performance. Our investment servicing assets under custody administration, which increased 5% quarter-over-quarter to $33.5 trillion, had another healthy level of new wins amounting to $162 billion in the second quarter. Assets yet to be installed stood at a strong $1 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.1 trillion and we recorded $23 billion of total net inflows during the second quarter. Our SPDR range of ETFs recorded its best quarter of inflows since the fourth quarter of 2017, while SPDR GLD, the gold ETF at its strongest ever level of inflows at $12 billion. Further, we are competing and winning in key strategic areas of focus for us. Our recently expanded and re-benchmarked range of low-cost ETFs also recorded its highest quarterly level of inflows at $11 billion. Our sector SPDRs made strong market share gains with almost half of sector industry flows going into the product during the second quarter. And we remain flight to quality for cash management and liquidity solutions across a suite of product options. We continue to play a critical role in supporting the financial system. The operating environment remains uncertain as the pandemic continues to impact many parts of the world. While we have seen a partial recovery in some areas, many economic indicators continue to point negatively and unemployment remains high, reflecting the real human cost of this health crisis. State Street continues to support the broader economy and markets and is actively assisting client access to various Federal Reserve programs that support the flow of liquidity and credit. Currently, State Street is involved in 5 Federal Reserve programs either directly, such as with the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility or as the program's custodian and administrator, such as the Main Street Lending Facility. Lastly, developing a high-performing organization and planning ahead for our global workforce also continues to be a priority. We continue to have about 90% of our employees working from home as we optimize a work-from-home model while leveraging technology to enable better collaboration and more effective ways to serve our clients. Last quarter, we took – we took measures to protect our employees and announced that through the end of the year we suspended any workforce reductions other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID-19 crisis. Now, we are going further for our employees by increasing their opportunities for mobility by launching an internal talent marketplace. By supporting our employees, as they take on new roles and learn new skills, the marketplace will better develop and redeploy our internal talent to meet our evolving business needs and the growing demands of clients and stakeholders.  Turning to Slide 4 in our second quarter and first half performance highlights, I am pleased by our continued strong performance and the progress we are making toward achieving our medium-term financial goals. Relative to the prior-year period, total revenue increased 2% and fee revenue increased 5%. Second quarter EPS was $1.86, up 31% year-over-year and ROE was 12.1%. I am pleased to report that our second quarter pre-tax margin improved by over 2 percentage points year-over-year to 27%. Our first half pre-tax margin increased by 3 percentage points. The front-to-back Alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients. Our second quarter performance was helped by the strong revenue performance at Charles River development, where we had key business wins and renewals. The Alpha CRD pipeline continues to develop well with a good mix of deal sizes, functionalities, and scope. We expect to be announcing new major wins between now and year end. Turning to expenses, the pandemic created an immediate challenge to our expense reduction planning relative to our original expectations at the start of the year. To help offset this impact, we took immediate action by implementing a hiring freeze, launching the talent marketplace I just referenced and reassessing all discretionary expenses. I am pleased to report that through our continued expense management efforts, further IT optimization, and operational productivity measures, we reduced total expenses by 3% in the second quarter relative to the year ago period. While we continue to invest in our business, first half 2020 expenses are now down 2% net of those investments relative to the year ago period. For us, productivity management is a way of life as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense management we successfully established during 2019 when we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency and reduce expenses through a comprehensive firm-wide expense savings program. We cannot control the economic environment, but we can control our expenses. Despite the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has created, we remain highly focused on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits as we strengthen our operating model and enhance service quality even during this challenging period. Turning to our balance sheet and capital, we are pleased with our 2020 CCAR results and the inaugural determination of our preliminary stress capital buffer at the minimum 2.5% level. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an unprecedented real time stress test and our strong capital position has enabled us to operate effectively, help stabilize the financial markets and support our clients, employees and communities. While the environment remains uncertain, State Street's performance under the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenario is another reminder of our business model's resiliency and our capital stability. We recently announced our intention to continue our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.52 per share in the third quarter. Consistent with the Federal Reserve's instructions to all large banks, we will be suspending share repurchases for the third quarter. As we look ahead, given our strong capital position, we will consider a full range of capital actions, including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters. We will of course take into account economic conditions, safety and soundness, the Federal Reserve supplemental CCAR scenarios and review process, our capital levels and any interim regulatory limitations. To conclude, I am very pleased with this quarter's results, which demonstrates continuing revenue improvement even during difficult times as well as further evidence of our ongoing ability to tightly control expenses while continuing to safeguard our employees and serve our clients. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thank you, Eric. Operator, can you open the call to questions? Eric, you are muted. Yes, Brian, why don't I start and then I'll turn it over to Eric. So I will start on the latter part of your question there. As we mentioned, when we acquired Charles River in addition to its core institutional client segment, it developed a fair amount of technology applicable to the wealth segment, particularly the larger wealth manager segment, large private wealth managers, warehouses, etcetera. And that is -- we have continued that R&D and also leveraged our own client relationships to be able to help propel that growth, and that's what you are seeing playing through. We see it as a solid and additional form of growth on top of the core institutional business. Right now, I think it's about 20% of the business, up significantly from when we acquired it and we would expect it to be growing probably a little bit more than the – at a slightly higher level than the institutional business. And the good news about this is that it shares the same technology and operating platform. I mean, there are certain sub applications that are different, but we can do this at scale easily. And the way I would say you should think about the lumpiness, I mean, Eric, will take you through the how the accounting actually works, but when you start to see kind of positive lumpiness like this, I mean, it's essentially a client being installed, and it's at the point then that we can start to recognize revenue and following that will be ongoing recurring fee. So, that's how you should interpret the lumpiness. It's not necessary. It is one-time as it relates to that client, but it's certainly not one time as we continue to grow. You will see that same kind of lumpiness. Good morning, Betsy. Hey, Glenn, It's Ron. So FNZ has a very strong operating platform. It's target market is certainly in the U.S. would be the smaller end or a lower end in terms of size of market segment than we do in Charles River and CRD. So, it's quite complimentary to what we do. We would also – we would be their custodian and administrator as they move into that space. So, we view it as a way to expand into even further into wealth, a segment that we wouldn't naturally have leading capabilities in number one. Number two, they have got some really interesting technology that we want to continue to figure out how we can use elsewhere. So it's a way of getting some technology leadership that as well as a revenue stream at a relatively low cost for us. Yes, Brennan, it's Ron. Maybe just to reinforce why that is, I mean, typically what goes on in these conversions is there is a pretty big and significant operating model change that goes on at the asset manager or the wealth manager. So typically, a new client is not that we are displacing somebody like Aladdin. Typically, it's a client that's got a bunch of bespoke and scattered technology. And they are moving to a comprehensive kind of system like this. So that's why you get very, very high retention rates, because frankly the switching costs on the client side are pretty high. Yes. Brennan, it's Ron. What I would add to that is in a fairly short period of time, we have gone through three kind of phases of work. Work from home was about a 1 week event for us and we got 90% of the people out of the buildings and into a home environment. We started about 3 weeks after that planning the return to office, which is in Asia-Pacific as you can imagine where it started back, also parts of Europe slower and you for all the reasons that we know. We have also launched the third phase of this, which is what we are calling the workplace of the future, which is encompasses a lot of things that Eric is talking about. To your point on Boston, as we had announced earlier, we are – we announced late last year that we are vacating this headquarters tower at the end of ‘22 going to move to a new building in Boston, but it's much more flexible, better terms, lower amount of space. And it's early enough now that we have ability to customize that even further given what we know about COVID-19. So, again, I don't believe that we could operate or should operate anything near 90% work from home, but we can operate in a much more flexible basis with work from home being an integral part of what we do it's certainly part of our disaster recovery now so you should start to see if shedding disaster recovery spaces, too. And you should expect and hold those two are a much lower for foot prints are really starting quite soon. Yes, Kenneth. As we talked about last quarter we said that it was our sense that just given the additional challenges post to asset managers and asset owners operating models of COVID-19 but we thought that we would see even at some point an increase in conversations an interest in outsourcing and operating model changes in general and that's actually started to happen and was started to happen in a big way in the second quarter so we see continued interest in not just movement of back office to the lowest price much more about how do we comprehensively improve – how do we – the asset owner or asset manager comprehensively improved our operating model through changes to their back office, and even to their front office. So that's continuing. And it's we have, as I noted in my opening remarks as a result of that, we would expect to see and be in a position to announce some significant new wins between now and the end of the year. That are some combination of front, middle and back office of notable names. Why don't I start there? Eric can talk about the mix, Alex, but on the wealth channel, it tends to be the higher – the larger wealth managers. And it's a combination if I think about both, what's installed this quarter, but also what's – where we have conversations and we will be installing a future quarters. It's a combination of the warehouses and that obviously comes with lots of seats, as you would imagine, but also the larger private wealth managers, I mean, they could be RIAs, but again, it tends to be the larger ones and the larger names. And if you think why that is, oftentimes they are bringing, these institutions are bringing some fairly significant asset allocation capability to bear. And while they want to give their advisors, some freedom to customize, they also want to have a lot of control over that. And the CRD platform works really well. And in that regard. And as I mentioned, in response to an earlier question, the great thing for us is that this, it's it, it certainly is a bespoke application for the wealth segment, but it's leveraging, much of the same underlying technology. So there's a lot of scale and all this both in terms of the initial development we have done but also as we, as we roll out software improvements. Good morning. That's right. I don't remember referring to lower pricing and in the context of the wins, But to answer your questions, it's a mix that we are seeing and right now I'm referring to the, what we call our alpha front to back platform in Charles River. It's a mix of, existing clients or new clients that we are seeing. And that's particularly true. As I look at the near-term, pipeline. So in for those existing clients, in effect, we are expanding our share of activity with them to use the vernacular expanding the wallet where we might historically have had a back office custody relationship. And we're moving to the middle of the funnel of this but beyond that, in the, kind of more traditional core business, we continue to see a fair amount of outsourcing there too firms that had historically done everything but custody inside where we might have been one or, or the only custodian or we are now reconsidering that and moving things like fund accounting out. Middle office would be another big part of that because in fact, our middle office business is the outsourcing of their back office and that solves lots of challenges for them, and we have learned how to scale that business. So that would give you a sense of all that. I mean, what has been pleasing about the pipeline as it's developed and again, given the comprehensive nature of what we do, these pipelines do take a while to move from when there's the first contact to the actual signing of the business, but what's pleasing about that is we are seeing a fair number of new clients there to us, and the, the attractive thing about that is to really get the full advantage of the front to back platform. We are able to show that, we can do the Charles River in middle office for you, but we are going to get real data advantages is having the full front to back. So it fuels growth in our traditional back office business. And Mike regarding, the last part of your question, which is State Street Global Advisors becoming a client of Charles River, they are actually becoming a client of of the full Alpha front-to-back platform, including Charles River. So it's a fairly comprehensive installments, it's underway. Alright. It's the inflation is happening. I mean, I am somewhat speculating here now, but we are well over half installed is the way I would describe it. And again, it's not just installing Charles River, but it's moving the State Street Global Advisors back office to our middle office platform. It's accommodating some existing technology that they have in place too. So as you would imagine, it's a $3.1 trillion asset manager, it's pretty complicated, but it's well over halfway to one. And just one last clarification, Eric, so the CRD revenue, should we $145 million in the second quarter, I know this is going to be pretty granular, but is that coming that's kind of lumpy or were you not – we should extrapolate that out or how should we think about that? Yes, Jim, it's a good question. The – when you see this kind of to be installed backlog if you will, that typically reflects that there is multiple tranches of business. So, for example, it could be custody and fund accounting in middle office. And a custody conversion we can do very quickly, right. We have – we literally did some we were notified by a client that they wanted to move in the midst of the crisis. And we got it done intra-quarter, those moves quickly. And so oftentimes don't even show up in this backlog here. I mean, they would if it was carrying over to a quarter. What you are seeing here is clients, including some very large clients that have multiple tranches of business that they are either moving over from an existing provider or in some cases moving from an in-source to an outsource model. And again, that reflects the nature of our business. We are using our ability to do these kinds of outsourcing to actually drive not just the outsource business, but not to drive traditional core custody, which scales easily and is quite profitable to us. But that's how you should think about that is that in any given quarter, our new business wins will be some very traditional custody to custody kinds of things or fund accounting to fund accounting. But oftentimes, the backlog reflects it was much more comprehensive kinds of moves. Well, what you should expect to see is that there is fees coming from more than one source right, the custody fee, fund accounting fee and middle office fee etcetera. So, that's how you should think about it. Vivek, we can't hear you. Are you there, Vivek? Well, thank you operator and thanks to all of you on the call, who joined us. Thanks for the questions and we look forward to the follow-up."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Let me begin my review of second quarter by summarizing our year-over-year results on the left panel on Slide 5. EPS is up 31%. Revenue is up 2%. Expense is down 3% with expanding margins and healthy ROEs. And I think it is useful to point out that while we continue to operate in an extraordinary environment for the COVID pandemic, our results this quarter shows strong underlying momentum and durability in our State Street operating model. Our bellwether servicing fees are up year-on-year. Our prior investments in our global FX and CRD franchises have yielded strong results. We have been able to carry reserve builds. And throughout all of this, we have continued to drive expenses lower and lower. And so our pre-tax margin is up 2.3 points year-on-year and our ROE is up 2 points. Turning to Slide 6, period end AUC/A levels increased 2% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year move was driven by higher period end market levels and client flows partially offset by previously announced client transition that had a de minimis effect on revenue during the quarter. Quarter-on-quarter, the AUC/A increased, which is partially reported on a lag was mainly due to higher period end equity market levels. AUM levels increased 5% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter to $3.1 trillion driven largely by higher period end market levels and net inflows. Amidst continued in uncertain economic conditions, Global Advisors saw net inflows of $23 billion driven by cash and ETF flows partially offset by institutional outflows. I highlight that our U.S. SPDR ETFs saw another strong quarter with $24 billion of inflows, which was well-diversified once again. As Ron mentioned, our low cost SPDR portfolio ETF saw their largest quarterly inflow yet and continue to gain share. Our commodity ETFs and sector ETFs saw strong inflows too. Moving to Slide 7, servicing fees were up 2% year-on-year reflecting higher client activity and net new business only partially offset by some pricing headwinds, which continue to moderate. Servicing fees were down 1% quarter-on-quarter driven by lower average market levels partially offset by higher client activity. Despite the recovery in equity markets since the first quarter, average domestic and international equity markets were still down sequentially impacting servicing fees. However, client activity remained elevated, so down from March levels as market volatility persisted throughout the quarter. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we have maintained business continuity and continue to provide clients with the benefits of our scale and diverse capabilities. On the bottom right of the panel, we have included again some sales performance indicators that underline this dynamic. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $162 billion in 2Q with several deals coming through. Assets to be installed as of period end 2Q are strong at $1 trillion. We continue to have a strong pipeline of front-to-back Alpha deals and expect multiple Alpha announcements in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other important revenue lines. Beginning with management fees, 2Q revenues decreased 4% year-over-year driven by institutional product outflows and mix partially offset by strong net inflows from both ETF and cash products. With the second quarter now complete and a better sense of the forward rate picture, we now anticipate that the likely impact of money-market fee waivers, net of distribution expense will be at the low end of our previously announced range or just $10 million to $15 million for the full year. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, FX trading services saw another strong quarter, with revenues up 26% year-on-year, but down 25% quarter-on-quarter as the business again saw elevated volumes and increased client demand, but down from the record levels seen in 1Q. The FX trading franchises continued to see market share gains and increased client engagement. As Ron mentioned, we saw strong results across the recently released 2020 Euromoney Survey, securing the number one spot in global customer satisfaction service as well as the number one spot for all products and for electronic trading for our asset manager clients. Security finance revenue decreased 27% year-on-year as they do see lending demand for assets lightens and shift towards lower spread fixed income assets and as ongoing hedge fund de-leveraging in falling markets drove down enhanced custody demand. Securities finance revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter. Finally, software and processing fees increased 46% year-on-year and more than doubled quarter-on-quarter driven by significant revenue-adds of CRD, which I will talk more about shortly and positive outcomes in our market sensitive activity, which includes certain currency translation impacts and marks on employee long-term incentive plans. These other items were positive this quarter in contrast to first quarter when they were notably negative. Moving to Slide 9, CRD generated standalone revenue of $145 million, which was up 59% year-on-year and 45% quarter-on-quarter driven by a large wealth implementation and several large asset manager renewals. We have always talked about the lumpiness inherent in ASC 606 revenue recognition standards. So, while we are extremely pleased with these results, we remind you not to read across any one quarter. Moving to the right hand side of the page, we were quite pleased to see the momentum in CRD this quarter overall and the progress we have made to extend the CRD presence in the wealth segment in particular, which you may recall was one of our key synergy commitments at the time of acquisition. Wealth now represents approximately 20% of CRD revenue and represents another area of growth for us. Turning to Slide 10, NII decreased 9% year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter. Excluding the impact of episodic market benefits of $20 million in the first quarter, NII was down 13% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline in NII was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of lower market rate, including the impact of central bank intervention with more USD liquidity driving lower than expected sponsor repo volumes. We continue to support client's use of the Federal Reserve's money market mutual fund liquidity facility. As a result this quarter, MMLF balances averaged $19 billion and finished the quarter at $11 billion. You will see on the left hand side of the slide, this quarter we all are also showing our NIM excluding the impact of the MMLF. While MMLF had a positive impact on NII this quarter, its impact on our NIM was a negative 5 basis points. Average assets increased 13% quarter-on-quarter, an average deposits increased 9% quarter-on-quarter. However, period-end deposits decreased 22% or $57 billion quarter-on-quarter as a portion of the uptick in the deposits we saw at the height of the pandemic receded in the last few months. Given the Fed's expansion of the money supply, however, we do expect a good portion of the current deposits to stay with us, which we will reinvest in a mix of both loans and securities. Moving to Slide 11, we have again included some color on the loan portfolio as well as the company's allowance for credit losses. On the top panels of this page, you can see updated detail around our high-quality loan book and its characteristics compared to first quarter average loans decreased 4%, while period-end loans decreased 17% primarily driven by reduction in client overdraft levels we saw during March. Overall, the loan book remains healthy with our largest lending category, capital call financing to private equity funds see no change in borrowing pattern, but with continued strong demand for new facilities. Moving to the bottom panels, the allowance for credit losses increased to $163 million, primarily due to a $52 million in provisions for credit losses driven by changing economic conditions and ratings migration offset by $14 million in net charge-offs. You will note we took advantage of a rally in the leverage loan market to selectively de-risk our leverage loan portfolio and exited certain positions, which effectively cost us $6 million given the necessary reserve bill, so a good trade. On Slide 12, we have again provided a view of expenses this quarter ex-notables so that the underlying trends are readily visible. Our 2Q ‘20 expenses were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, excluding both notable items and seasonal expenses, with favorable trends across most expense categories. As we said last quarter, amidst the ongoing pandemic, we continue to execute on many of the investments and optimization savings initiatives detailed earlier in the year. And while we suspended workforce reductions for year end other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID crisis, we have found additional expense opportunities to act upon. We continue to make progress on lowering compensation benefits costs, occupancy costs and other costs, while IT costs are lumpy, but on track. We are particularly pleased that our results reflected continued and sustainable expense reduction, notwithstanding the extraordinary market conditions, while also delivering top line revenue growth. Moving to Slide 13, on the right, you can see the evolution of CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. We are thus navigating this challenging environment with strong capital levels. In 2Q, our standardized CET1 ratio increased 1.6 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 12.3% driven by solid retained earnings and a reduction in RWAs as market volatility receded. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was essentially flat at 6.1% due to higher capital levels offset by higher deposits. We were also pleased with our 2020 CCAR results. Our capital resilience under the Fed stress scenarios continues to demonstrate our low risk profile. And this year, we received a preliminary stress capital buffer requirement of 2.5%, which would have been much lower if it were not floored at 2.5%. As you know, the Fed has had large banks to suspend share buybacks in third quarter. However, we expect to continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share. And finally, as Ron noted, the firm's capital position remains strong amidst the uncertainty created in the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we will consider a full range of capital actions, including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters, but we will do so considering economic conditions, safety and soundness, the Fed's supplemental CCAR scenarios and review process, our capital levels and then the interim regulatory limitations. Turning to Slide 14, we have again provided a summary of our 2Q results. As we mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results and believe they are a reflection of the durability and resiliency of State Street's business model as well as our focus on delivering on our strategy of both growth and productivity. Throughout this crisis, we have differentiated ourselves by proactively reaching out and assisting clients through these difficult times. We believe that our resiliency during this extraordinary period and our constant attention to service quality has created goodwill with our clients and positioned us for share gains over the medium to long-term. Last quarter, I outlined our full year financial outlook under a certain set of assumptions, noting that there was a range of possibilities as a result of the potential length of the COVID pandemic and the associated economic impacts. I would like to update those expectations with our current thinking, again, noting there remain a broad range of possible outcomes. We now expect global central banks will keep short rates at current levels for the remainder of the year and long end rates will stay at a June 30 spot rates through year end. We also now assume that average global equity markets levels for the remainder of 2020 will be flat to current levels. As a result of our client engagements, moderating pricing pressure and CRD and Alpha front-to-back wins, we now expect that full year fee revenue will no longer be down 1% to 2% year-on-year for the full year 2020, but instead will be up approximately 1.5% to 2% with servicing fees expect to show a year-over-year improvement relative to 2019. Regarding NII given the impact of continued lower long end rates on the investment portfolio and central bank intervention with more USD liquidity driving down the expected repo volumes, we now expect NII to be down approximately 9% to 11% on a sequential quarter basis and expect the fourth quarter to be relatively in line with the coming third quarter. Turning to expenses, we remain laser focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and achieving automation benefits. We expect that full year expenses will now be down at the better end of our previous guide of down 1% to 2% year-on-year, excluding notable items as we continue to find ways to control and drive down expenses. In regards to our provision for credit losses, we continue to see a range of outcomes based on evolving economic conditions and any ratings migrations. On taxes, we expect our tax rate for the full year to be closer to the lower end of our 17% to 19% range. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Brian it's Eric. Thanks for the question. We are clearly navigating through some challenging times with the interest rate environment and obviously trying to do our best to navigate through. When you think about the NII guide, there is clearly the continued downtick in long-term rates, which is affecting the investment portfolio, and we will continue to some extent in the coming quarters after that. And then there is lower volume sequentially and overdraft and then the MMLF balances that are also contributing to that – to the second quarter to third quarter decline. I think once we get to that level, part of what happens is that you have got offsetting factors, you have got on one hand the lower long end rates which put up -- which tend to tractor through the investment portfolio for another couple of quarters, which creates a downdraft. And those I think can be offset by the growth in the investment portfolio and lending base, which is really supported by the higher levels of deposits that we are operating at. Now, it's hard to tell exactly what the deposit levels are going to be, but I think if you stare at the data that we have shown here, you know, we used to run at $155 billion to $160 billion of deposits. First quarter average was solidly at $180 billion. Second quarter averages solidly at $197 billion. We think we are going to land somewhere between those two points, which means that off of the original base as, call it $160 billion of deposits, there is an ability to expand the investment portfolio put on duration carefully and selectively invest in some high-quality position to maintain our HQLA, and we think that together should create some stability on NII in the coming quarters. The sponsored repo program, as you mentioned, did create a downdraft from 1Q to 2Q. And what we are seeing there is that the overnight repo rates are less attractive then they have been relative to 1-month treasury rates, and so that creates reduction in volumes. If that were to persist, then we are not going to get a lift there and we are not going to get the volumes we would like to see. On the other hand, if that normalizes back, there could be some upside in the coming quarters, but more time will tell before we can incorporate that into our forecast. Brian, let me add some texture and even some numbers to that so that you can get a better sense of the underlying revenues here. And we are quite pleased with the growth trajectory. We are quite pleased with the pipeline with kind of contracted, but not yet installed levels. We track a number of different metrics here to give us confidence in the developing growth. The revenues really come, I will call it, broadly into two buckets. There is SaaS revenues and professional services. And SaaS revenues are pretty straightforward, you win a client, it's a 5-year contract and the revenue recognition is that the revenue is ratably applied over those five years, very straight forward. And in fact, we want to be in the business of growing SaaS revenues over time and professional services because those create a very regular and recurring set of revenues. The second part of the revenues comes from on-premise installations, and we have a number of clients who've had on-premise installations and even some who continue to prefer them. And in those cases, the revenue recognition comes in two parts. You have an upfront piece, which could be in the range of around 60% of the contract. And then you have the balance, call it 40% in the example I have given you, which could be ratably over the contract length, if that were say a four- or five-year contract, and so you get a piece and then you get a trail behind that. So those are the two big pieces.  When we look at the revenue numbers that we showed you on page nine, you go back what we want to be doing, we want to be growing both pieces to be honest and in particular, the regular. The first one, the very recurring revenue base, if you go back on Page 9 and you look at the data that we showed around revenues, back in the second quarter of 2019, we had $91 million of revenues, about 65% of that was in SaaS and professional fees. And so it gives you a sense for the kind of the relative amount if you go quarter over quarter of this year, those recurring SaaS and professional fee revenues were just over $80 million. But we see both, we see nice growth, year on year, and in fact, it's happened consistently over the five quarters, and then the balance of the 145 is been more in the on-premise kind of revenue installations where you get a good sized piece up front, but then the recurring piece in the future. And I think if you step back with that kind of revenue recognition, where we are focused on growing client and client engagements and some clients are delighted to be on the Saas platform and we have seen consistent growth there. So that gives us some confidence in the kind of the, the, the completely recurring base, and then you have the more on-prem kind of revenues which start off with a piece, they then have a trail. Alright, and then when the contract ends, you get another piece in the that's lumpy, and then in a trail after that, and that's just the nature of the beast of how, how the revenue recognition works all in. we are quite pleased with this revenue trajectory the backlog the contracted but not yet installed and the sales performance and so while you see some lumpiness, it is we are seeing good underlying metrics as well. Betsy, it's Eric. Both of those are sizable expense categories, they both are part of the transaction processing line item that we report. And, what we found is that we need to just actively manage those, sub-custody is something that that we need provided to us. And so, we've worked with some of the largest banks, as well as some of the, country banks to find the best mix of service at a declining cost level, in our view that is something we need to keep doing year after year. And we have been able to deliver I think, some good savings this year and our expectation is to continue that trajectory. Market data is a little more complicated to your point is that there is a of market data ingestion that is possible. And what we found is that we need to both manage the ingestion pipes, because if we secure market data in too many different pipes, then we end up buying more than we need. We also need to find vendors. And over the last couple of quarters, we have started to really work more closely with several of our vendors around who gives us the best cost and pricing kind of quality levels. And that's also been factored in. And then there is a third piece to be honest on market data, which I find helpful from a client standpoint to be honest, which is some of our market data costs are borne by us, which we want to drive down, but with the right quality and others, market data costs are sometimes borne with our buyer clients. And we are in many cases working with our vendors against both pools of market data to try to secure the best results for them as well. So, lots of activity there. What I would tell you is that some of what you see on that transaction processing line is the result of some intense focus on those areas. And it's actually a bit of an example of what we are doing in other areas. We talked about starting to drive our technology costs down. And so we are doing similar work on hardware costs and hardware vendors working with them in a more active way. We are doing that in software and maintenance contracts from the technology side. And so it's really become an expanding, I will call it expertise, but sort of partnerships and approaches that we have taken I think to good effect, but to be honest one that we need to repeat year after year to get the benefits that we would like to help drive our expanding margins. Yes. The 4Q stabilization is really driven by I think the economic kind of the interest rate environment first and foremost. So we are assuming short-end rates stays more or less where they are and we are assuming long-end rates stay more or less where they are. You know, the forwards always have some expansion and increase and I think we have gotten a little gun shy about always planning for those. And so we feel like we should plan at the current levels. So that's the first part of the assumption base. I think the second part of the assumption base is that there is some normalization deposits, but as I have said, I think we have got a nice chunk there that we can begin to think of this, whether we are confident, are stickier. And it depends on the speed of our reinvestment in the investment portfolio into some asset classes that we are comfortable with. And I think that will factor in as well. Yes, Glenn, that's fair, because as you just – as you know, we are trying to find sustainable expense reductions this year and then into next year. And if we just brought them down and they pop back up, that doesn't count neither for our shareholders nor for us. There aren't some tailwinds of travel expenses and even some medical benefit claims, you know, are lighter in the expense trends, but remember, there is also some headwinds that we would have are actions in areas where we would have driven expenses down that we weren't able to. And so as the biggest simple example is the pause on layoffs because of the pandemic, that would have been worth at least half a point of expense reduction, if not a little more, for every quarter this year and on a full year basis. And I think what we are going to have to do next year is go back to what we have been doing driving down all of our costs or compensation benefit costs, where we will be able to now action that and continue to drive-down third-party spend costs as well. And so I think we are – I think the trends will line up, there are just going to be some ins and outs or headwinds and tailwinds at any point, but we see a path to continue doing what we are doing, which is to drive expenses lower and lower year after year. Brennan, it's Eric. It's fair to get into the details, because the details do matter. But as we do that, let me remind you, there is a range of details. And so let me try to answer the question that we can certainly follow-up with you and other investors that are curious, but this is a bit of the bankers working in a software space, which just operates in a different cadence with ASC 606. First, the recurring revenues, the SaaS kind of implementations are pretty straightforward. And I think I gave the numbers there. And I think you have got the right mix. The mix in each of these quarters has always been much more kind of SaaS professional services, the completely, I will call it completely stable revenues and those have been building nicely. And I think we are quite pleased with that trajectory. On the lumpier part of the revenues which is the on-prem – on-premise installations, the answer is there is a range of different situations, which have to do with different contract length. And so let me just give you a sense, contract lengths can range from call it 3 years to 8 years, right. And for those kinds of ranges, then you tend to get on 3-year contracts, you might get 70% upfront and then the other 30% over the rest of the 3 years comes in kind of year by year by year or quarter by quarter by quarter the effect or for something like that 7 or 8 year contract you will tend to get about 50% in the first year and then the other 50% in those 7 or 8 years ratably. And so there is a range, but I think it's I don't know it's contemplated to measure the revenues in a reasonable way. And you will have to talk with them if you like it or not, I can't really opine there, but that's the range. The upfront piece comes in, in a particular quarter and why is that because that's when the system literally goes live and it's beginning to serve clients. So, it becomes in service and it's the quarters after that through the length of the contract that you ratably see the rest of the revenues. What I do want to remind folks though is that once we have a client, the client retention in our business are very, very high. We retain most of our clients. And so, on a 3-year contract, you will the description that I just gave of 70% plus of 30% over the trail, 3 years later gets repeated, right? Same for a 5-year contract, 5 years out. And so in a way, we are little hesitant when people casually say, well, that's one-time it's not really one time, right, it's there is a good piece upfront, there is a good piece reasonably process that we have secured. And then there is almost always the extension, which brings the same thing again, it's just that it's a little lumpier than that we would all like. So maybe I will pause there, but happy to talk more at the right time. We can, I think it's very high. Why don't we – why don't we do a little follow-up and get that out to you in a Reg FD. But it's – we have been with part of our diligence of retention rates. Before I quote a precise number, let me come back to you, but it's very, very high. It's something that gives us a lot of confidence, because remember, once you have an on-premise installation like you have invested a lot internally as become a client side to integrate it with your state, with your other systems and subsystems. And so there is a willingness and there is an ability which together result in very, very strong, very high renewal rates. Brennan, it's Eric. Let me start on that to give you a little bit of kind of near-in views and Ron may play in as well. And in fact, I might ask your CFO the same question, when I see him next, because I think every CFO out there not just bank CFOs is wrestling with this specific question. Here at State Street, we have occupancy expense of about $435 million bucks. And we had already plans to drive it down this year by about 5%. So, taking a chunk out of that, and part of that is continued gratification of our high cost, location footprint, and taking advantage at the same time as some of the productivity, right, think both from the headcount management that we have done around the world as well. I think, I think in the very near term a couple things happen in real estate one is we just don't add any real estate and Ron and I put immediate halt. As soon as this pandemic happens, let me tell you, there's no, there's no that a halt is, is perpetual practically. If then, it does have a little bit of an effect where we can easily sublease. So, now what we are doing is going back to every lease that we have, and literally going through and asked him the question, when does it roll over? The question that it really wrestles through is what kind of occupancy rate can you operate add? And if you know most of us have operated at the – call it 85% to 95% occupancy rate. And I think what this pandemic has demonstrated is that the tools and the capabilities through technology and the methods that we have in a company, if we can, we can drive occupancy rates up to we are originally planning to 130%, 140% just by thinking about people's historic approaches to being in the office or not and I think that, that is kind of what gives us the view that, if we originally saw we could get to 120% occupancy rates. And now with a pandemic, we are confident, we could get to 150%. That's how you start to get some real leverage on the occupancy costs. I think the one thing that gets in the way of that and I am thinking of various kind of financial lens and we have to think about our people, our teams, our clients, and all the interactions and all that they do is we also need to be respectful of some of the social distancing requirements in the immediate term. And so I think what we have is we have a periods right now where, work from home is 90%, let's say, with social distancing, we can bring a certain number in. At some point, there is a vaccine. So the social distancing may not be at the same level as it is now and we have a whole group of employees who have learned to operate incredibly effectively work from home, some of whom prefer to be home. And so I think I think there is a lot to do here is I get the summary. I tell you we are already driving down occupancy costs. And I think the question that we will come back to in the coming quarters and in the coming year is how much more, it's not that they can't that they won't come down, they will come down. I think it's a question of scale off of that base of expense that I circled upfront. Thank you, Brennan. Sure, Ken. Part of the reason we gave an overall fee guide is that there is always are and always going be some ins and outs in that in the various fees I think if you think about the different buckets the texture that I give against the full year guide 1.5% to 2% first on servicing fees I think we feel positive we've delivered year on year growth in servicing fees now for the first quarter year on year and then the second quarter year on year and we think that will be a positive for the year and that's different I contrast that to previous years where we had more fee headwinds or where we didn't feel like we have the performance we would alike but we think servicing fees will be positive and that's without an average equity market uptick really because globally equity markets are kind of in a more flattish range management fees I think are doing well we have been a little more negative there we would like to do a little bit better than what we have done FX trading and then all the electronic services around that will be a clear positive FX lending a little lighter as we described some of the shift there but area that we are working on and then in the software and processing fees I think we are quite confident on the Charles river momentum especially with some of the recent win and then there is a kind of the there are some other in that line there are some other business activity or loan fees or other software fees etcetera then there's some of the lumpy stuff that we have to just take in Mark so all in all though full year 1.5% to 2% is what we see today. Which is I think it gives us the positive momentum that we live and then something to build on for next year and our view is if we can drive even low single digit fees upwards and continue to drive expenses down we are getting the right results. And Alex, just have round out on the financial fleet, we had a range of implementations of this quarter on the on premise side, that ones that are lumpier. The range was 3 years to 8 years. And it actually runs the gamut of 50% to 70% in the first year and then the balance ratably. I think the largest of implementations was that's going to be on the close to 8-year mark, which would be 50% in the first year and the other 50% in the coming year – in the coming years. Yes, Alex, it's little early to get into 2021 to be honest, but with the guide I gave for 4Q does contemplate some reinvestment in the investment portfolio. And we are just kind of driving the balance both the long end range do have a kind of a tale of effects for us. And so in a way this is the time for us to add to the investment portfolio and do our work to offset what would naturally be a downward headwind, but I think we are – we have got a path. It's just – it's hard to see growth in NII at this point. We are both what we see a path to relative stability within a range, but it's going to take some work. And, we don't really know what happens with rates and how they evolve. But, we can we can see a path there. Yes Morning. Sure, Gerard. We are trying to be proactive here, right. The leveraged loan market has really moved up and down and a good day. And just finding some points where it might make sense. We de risked roughly about $160 million of balances of leveraged loans. I remember, one of the cinema chains was in that and we got out at a good price. I think the average pricing on the exits was around, I think around $0.92 I want to say, on the $1, so somewhere in that range, so we feel like we made some, good tactical decisions. It didn't cost us that much, because we would have had to build the reserve anyway for those. And that's why I said on that $160 million in cost that's effectively a net fix. But for the peace of mind and just trying to be careful because we are a trust and custody bank and that's our brand, we felt like it was a good trade and we will continue to selectively do that. But in truth, we feel quite good about this loan book. I mean, it's a most leveraged loans are in the indices are single B and below are the double B and sometimes even better. And so I think we are pretty confident here, but there is always something and we just – we are happy to be proactive and make some tactical decisions and that's what we did. Sure, Mike. It's Eric. Let me take the first couple and then I think Ron will probably want to take the third. In terms of the full year guide, you are right, there is a number of different pieces to it. There was some pieces of the full year, 1.5% to 2% fee revenue guide that are driven by the first half of the year. And there is some that will be driven by I think continued progress in the second half. I think if you just go through the line items, servicing fees has been good for the first half and we expect them to continue to be good, but I that will be a continued story. Management fees largely because of market, I think a little lighter in the first half, we are hoping that they come in a little stronger on a year-on-year basis in the second half, FX obviously a first half story where the second half will not be there. Sec finance has been light for us in the first half. We are hoping for some and looking for some stability there and some sequential – some sequential stability, if not some little bit of uptick. And then you have Charles River where we obviously got a big part in the second quarter but – and that maybe end up being a little more first half weighted, but I think you are – you typically get performance in the fourth quarter of these software businesses, but we will see I think some activity there. So, a little bit of a mix, to be honest. On Charles River, the good question on the on-premise installation, in particular or the renewals, but I think it's really on a kind of combination of the new implementations. You do get some professional servicing fees where we build revenues and we incur expenses. And my recollection is those are fairly aligned, the accounting centers encourage us to do that. But there – I think the professional services tend to be billed as incurred. And then – and part of what I described is the more stable part of the revenues. And what we are finding is there is just there is professional services installation work that we do for kind of coming clients, clients that are not yet implemented, but are on their way to implementation. There is some during the implementation that last sprint and then there is clients behind that. So it's a bit of a mix to be honest, but something we can try to parse out a little more detail in future conferences or calls. No, it's lumpy. And Mike, that's why I was trying to give a little bit of color, but just to reaffirm, in that $145 million, we said they are kind of very recurring literally kind of recurring revenues of just over $80 million and then the balance is in the kind of lumpy category where you get these on-premise installations. I also – so you kind of have to take a piece of the lumpy and say there is always going to be lumpy, because we have 3-year contracts, 5-year contracts, 8-year contracts. And every quarter, every year, there is some of those contracts rollover. And so you are going to get a new lumpiness or you get new business that you add in the lumpy category. I also gave if you want another quarter as a contrast back a year ago, second quarter of ‘19 we have $90 million of total revenues. And I said we had about $65 million of the very kind of recurring SaaS and professional services revenues. And just a smaller piece of that was lumpy. So you can kind of think I think draw some lines and say the lumpiness – this is big lumpy, that's for sure, but there is only going to be some, but I think – I think hopefully I have given you enough on the kind of SaaS and professional services to let you extrapolate from there and then put in something in the models on the on the lumpy part."

Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRonald O'Hanley: Thanks Ilene and good morning everyone. You will have seen that today, we released our first quarter earnings results. I am pleased with our performance during such turbulent times, and I am proud of our team members worldwide who achieved these results. The COVID-19 health crisis has necessitated a rapid curtailment of economic activity, which in turn has driven significant financial market volatility and a lack of liquidity in some fixed income markets. The markets in general and State Street specifically, have withstood the volatility well. Central banks moved quickly to help alleviate market stress and State Street's long-standing business continuity planning, supplemented by rapid innovation, has enabled us to operate, protect our employees, and serve our clients exceptionally well. Throughout this period, we have continued to execute against our strategy, which is reflected in our strong performance. Before discussing our quarterly financial performance, I want to review some of the actions that we have taken in support of our clients and to protect the safety of our global workforce, all while remaining focused on State Street's operational excellence, resiliency and business performance. Turning to slide three, I will outline some of the key aspects of State Street's response to the pandemic. As a global company operating in 29 countries, we have been addressing the coronavirus since its very inception with significant operations and approximately 3,000 employees in China, we had somewhat of a head start on adapting our global operating model to the rapidly changing needs of our clients as well as to the safety concerns of our approximately 39,000 employees across the globe. Our actions in response to this global health crisis have centered on maintaining employee safety and business continuity and resilience, while concurrently supporting our clients, the financial markets, and the broader economy. Let me start with our people. Here, our Senior Global Crisis Team has worked continuously since mid-January with local management and relevant authorities across the world to safeguard employee health and wellbeing. Our IT capabilities rapidly allowed us to add capacity for remote access solutions, while also maintaining cyber safety. And today, approximately 90% of our global workforce is working from home. We announced that through the end of the year, we suspended any workforce reductions other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID-19 crisis. I believe this is the right decision for our people, our clients and our communities. It aligns with our culture and values and reflects our financial strength. We are undertaking actions to offset the cost of this decision, which we will describe later in the presentation. Let me turn to our clients in the broader markets. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and the pace and timing of an economic recovery will influence investor behavior, financial market conditions, and our clients, who are the owners and managers of the world capital. State Street plays a central role in the infrastructure of the global financial system. This crisis has demonstrated our deep operational capabilities at a time of significantly increased business volumes. Our global operating model has enabled us to run split operations where we can efficiently transfer work with minimal disruption to client service at a time when we have seen a significant expansion in activity. For example, in March, we experienced a 50% increase in back-office transactions and an over 80% increase in middle office transactions. Similarly, valuation checks for NAV calculations due to significant asset price moves, which typically run at approximately $70,000 per day; it is high as $1 million per day at the height of the market volatility. Due to the scale and reach of the current COVID-19 crisis, asset owners and asset managers have been impacted globally with many struggling to cope with market disruptions, reduced workforces, limited access to normal workplace infrastructure, and continuing uncertainty. To assist these clients, we have focused on a number of priorities during the last few weeks. First, we have increased our level of client engagement and communication ensuring we better understand client needs and how we can rapidly assist them in this unique and challenging environment. Second, we are maintaining a state of operational readiness through increased IT resource capacity with strong and tested business continuity plans put into action, as I mentioned earlier. Third, we are providing a suite of liquidity solutions. State Street has a range of short-term cash investment options for our clients, including deposits, centrally clear repo and access to a full range of money market funds via our investment portal Fund Connect. Global Advisors also has a number of specialized cash strategies. In addition, our global credit finance team supports clients with overdraft capacity and committed lines of credit. We also stand ready to support the broader economy. State Street is actively assisting our clients to tap various Federal Reserve programs that support the flow of liquidity and credit, facilitating approximately 50% of money market mutual fund liquidity facility, or MMLF usage, while also serving as the custodian and accounting administrator for the commercial paper funding facility. Many clients appreciated that we worked closely with the Federal Reserve to set up the MMLF and enable clients to access liquidity even before it's fully operational, which helped clients stabilize their funds. As we look out over the longer term, the evolving needs of all of our clients are at the center of our strategy to continue to be our clients' essential partner and provide the technology and scale they need to grow when the current uncertainty dissipates and global macroeconomic conditions recover. We believe this crisis will only accelerate the desire of clients to outsource more of their operations and partner with a fully capable front-to-back provider like State Street. Turning to slide four, I am pleased by the direction and progress of our strategy as demonstrated by our strong first quarter performance. Relative to the prior year period, first quarter total revenue increased 5%, and on a sequential quarter basis, total revenue increased 1%. First quarter EPS was $1.62, up 37% year-over-year, and ROE was 10.9%. I am pleased to report that our first quarter pretax margin improved by over three percentage points to 25.6%, excluding notable items. Despite the unprecedented levels of equity market volatility during the first quarter, our results benefited from the relatively stable domestic equity market averages relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. Market averages were materially higher than the year ago period as a result of the dramatic global equity market sell-off in late 2018. Industry flows were positive in aggregate as investors move from long mutual fund positions into ETFs and money market bonds. At State Street, we saw a particularly strong recovery in U.S. flows relative to the first quarter of 2019. While FX volatility remained at low levels for the first half of the quarter, our results, ultimately, benefited from materially higher levels of FX volatility experienced during the latter half of the quarter and the market tumult associated with COVID-19. That volatility, plus our multi-year innovation investments, led to record FX results. First quarter NII benefited from significantly higher deposit levels as clients turn to us as part of their flight to quality, despite dramatic long and short end rate reductions. Assets under custody and administration fell 7% quarter-over-quarter to $31.9 trillion as a result of lower period end market levels. We saw a healthy level of new wins during the quarter, totaling $171 billion. Assets yet to be installed stood at $1.1 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, assets under management fell 14% quarter-over-quarter to $2.7 trillion as a result of lower period end equity market levels. Global advisers recorded $39 billion of total net inflows during the first quarter, the highest quarter of net inflows in a year. Net inflows were driven by strong inflows in cash and good inflows in the institutional business, as clients turned to State Street's offerings in a time of turmoil. After experiencing net outflows in January and February, I would note that March was a particularly strong month for our ETF business, with our SPDR suite of ETF gathering more than $20 billion in net inflows. Aided by the integration of Charles River Development, we continue to see that our front-to-back Alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients and building on this remains a key focus for us in 2020. We signed a large sovereign wealth fund as a front-to-back client in quarter one. The front-to-back State Street Alpha pipeline is developing and advancing well with a good mix of deal sizes, functionality and scope. Turning to expenses, first quarter total expenses were down 1% relative to the year ago period, excluding notable items. We are building on the strong culture of expense management we successfully established during 2019, when we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency, and reduce expenses through a comprehensive firm-wide expense savings program. Today, we are more focused than ever on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits, as we strengthen our operating model, even during this unprecedented period. In addition, as a result of the current environment and our decision to suspend workforce reductions, we are taking additional expense actions, including a hiring freeze for non-critical operational positions. We also continue to very carefully manage all discretionary expenses. To conclude, while we cannot predict the scope and duration of the pandemic and the associated economic impact, we will remain very, focused on three core priorities. First, supporting our employees and our communities, second, providing service and operational excellence to our clients, and third, driving value for our shareholders. While the markets may be unpredictable, we are well prepared to navigate this volatility with a strong balance sheet, capital position and proven operational capabilities. We at State Street remain outward looking, globally connected and laser-focused on helping our clients achieve better investment outcomes for the people they serve. State Street has navigated through good times and bad times for our clients for over two centuries and this moment will be no different. We stand ready to support our clients and our global workforce in any capacity we can. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. To start my review of our first quarter results, I'd like to go to slide five, where you can see, we reported EPS of $1.62, up 37% year-over-year. On the top left panel, I would call your attention to two items. First, our FX trading business had extraordinary quarter, generating revenues of $459 million of record volumes and increased client demand, which I'll spend more time discussing shortly. And second, we had a $36 million provision expense with a sequential increase driven largely by the effects of the COVID-19, on our economic forecast. On the top right panel, we had $11 million of expected pretax acquisition and restructuring charges, primarily related to Charles River as well as $9 million of after-tax costs associated with the redemption of our Series C preferred securities.  On the bottom left panel, we show our quarterly results, ex-notable items for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. I would also note that we were able to generate positive operating leverage in the first quarter, helping to improve our first quarter 2020 pretax margin year-over-year. Turning to slide six, period end, AUC/A levels decreased 2% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter. Year-over-year, AUC/A were affected by a previously announced client transition that had a deminimis effect on year-on-year revenues. Quarter-on-quarter, the AUC/A decrease were mainly due to lower end-of-period equity market levels. As a reminder, approximately half of our AUC/A is reported on a one month lag, so some of the impact of the equity sell off seen in March has not yet reflected the year. AUM levels decreased 4% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter to $2.7 trillion, driven largely by lower end-of-period market levels, partially offset by strong net inflows over both time periods. Amidst the extraordinary market conditions for asset managers in the first quarter, State Street global advisers saw net inflows of $39 billion, largely driven by cash and institutional inflows. Unpacking the first quarter, AUM trends a bit, it was a tale of January and February versus March as after seeing modest net outflows in the first two months of the quarter, Global Advisors saw strong inflows of approximately $45 billion in March with $27 billion in cash inflows and $23 billion in ETFs. Global Advisors saw strong inflows of more than $10 billion in March alone into SPY, our premier S&P 500 ETF offering, and the largest and most liquid product in its class. Moving to slide seven, servicing fees were up 3% year-on-year as the core business continued to regain momentum and down 1% quarter-on-quarter on lower equity markets. As Ron said, the investment services business saw significantly elevated client activity inflows during the quarter, particularly in March and successfully navigated the activity with minimal service disruptions. Through this stressed environment, we believe clients realize, perhaps more than ever the value of our scale and capabilities during exceptionally challenging market conditions. By way of an example, a number of our asset manager clients have expressed gratitude for their partnership with State Street and the fact that our investment servicing business has worked tirelessly to ensure that their fund investors are able to buy, sell, and monitor their fund performance, both accurately and timely, which gives them the strong sense of confidence they deserve. On the bottom right panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators that underlying this dynamic. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $131 billion in the first quarter with several deals coming through the pipeline in late March. We do expect to see some near-term slowdown in sales, but assets to be installed as of the first quarter period end is strong at $1.1 trillion, and we still expect fee pressure to remain moderated as it has in recent quarters. Turning to slide eight, let me discuss the other fee revenue lines. Beginning with management fees, first quarter revenues were up 7% year-on-year, but down 3% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower average market levels and mix changes away from higher fee institutional products, partially offset by positive mix changes in ETFs. As I mentioned earlier, FX trading services were up 64% year-on-year and 68% quarter-on-quarter as the business saw record volumes and increased client demand given market volatility amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, something I'll be discussing more -- in more detail shortly. Securities Finance revenues were down 22% year-on-year as investor asset mix shifted towards lower spread fixed income assets and as hedge fund deleveraging in foreign markets drove down the enhanced custody demand. Revenues were down 17% quarter-on-quarter due to similar factors. Finally, software and processing fees were down 41% year-on-year and 49% quarter-on-quarter. As you know, this line includes certain business revenues such as CRD software fees, as well as other lumpy items, such as the amortization of tax advantaged investments, certain currency translation impacts, and the mark-to-market adjustment on the employee long-term incentive plans. These other items are worth about $65 million negative this quarter as opposed to the usual slight positive. Moving to slide nine, we wanted to provide some incremental color around the extraordinary quarter we saw on the FX trading franchise. For several quarters now, we've been highlighting that our FX business had been confronting historically low volatility levels, but that we have been focused on expanding the client base and building share of wallet, while reinvesting in our broad set of platforms. This quarter, we are thus, well-positioned to support our clients' needs as volumes and volatilely level surged to the COVID-19 pandemic, spurring elevated client demand across our various FX trading venues. As you can see, the FX sales and trading business, including direct FX and custody FX, saw a 40% increase in volumes from average levels, while our FX trading platforms, including FX Connect and Currenex saw a 50% increase in volumes over the same period. On the right-hand side of this page, we've included the most recent Euromoney Rankings related to the FX business, including its number one ranking for real money asset managers for two years in a row to give you a sense of the depth and breadth of this important franchise. Moving to slide 10, you'll see in the top left panel a five quarter summary of CRD's stand-alone revenue and pretax income. For first quarter, CRD generated standalone revenue of $100 million, which was up 1% year-on-year and down 21% quarter-on-quarter. I would again remind this audience the lumpiness inherent in ASC 606 revenue recognition standards and to not read across any one quarter's results. Having said that, we do expect some disruption and updates in professional services fees over the coming months as on-site activity is currently somewhat curtailed. On the right panel, we've again included some texture around the momentum we're seeing in the business and how the integration is progressing. We continue to remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition. Turning to slide 11, NII was down 1% year-on-year, but up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential increase in NII was primarily driven by increased deposit balances and episodic market-related benefits of approximately $20 million, partially offset by long-term debt issuance costs. Average assets were up as average deposits increased 10% quarter-on-quarter from fourth quarter 2019, with period end deposits increasing 41% quarter-on-quarter as we saw a wave of flight-to-quality client deposits surge at the end of March, particularly from asset managers. We were there to support our clients. We've since seen deposit levels receipt somewhat in April, but they still remain elevated versus 4Q 2019 levels. End-of-period assets were also driven off by $27 billion as we help clients access the Fed's new money market mutual fund liquidity facility or MMLF. State Street facilitated just over 50% of the MMLF volume as we asserted our leadership role in supporting our clients and the smooth functioning of markets. Moving to slide 12, we've included some color here on the loan portfolio as well as the company's allowance for credit losses. As you know, State Street's loan portfolio is relatively small, typically 10% or so of average assets and generally consist of high-quality and conservatively underwritten mix of fund finance, leveraged loans, commercial real estate and municipal loans. On the right panel of this page, we've included some incremental detail around the loan book and its characteristics. In the current environment, I'd note a few highlights as of first quarter. Approximately 91% of the book is investment grade with 84% of the on-balance sheet exposure to investment-grade and 98% of the off-balance sheet exposures. The leverage loan portfolio of approximately $4 billion has relatively low exposure to cyclical factors currently in focus and has an average rating of BB, which is stronger than the traditional index. Compared to 4Q 2019, average loans grew 12%, while period-end loans grew 23%, primarily driven by elevated client overdrafts as we help clients facilitate the higher settlement of trades and FX activities during March. These overdrafts have already receded in April. Moving to the bottom left panel, the total allowance for credit losses increased by $35 million to $124 million as we added to reserves, largely related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the end of March economic forecast. On slide 13, we've again provided a view of expenses this quarter, ex-notables, so that the underlying trends are really visible. Our first quarter 2020 expenses excluding notable items and seasonal expenses were down 2% year-over-year, driven by resource discipline and reengineering efforts and down 2% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by the timing of foundation funding, lower travel and lower professional expenses. We continue to execute on many of the investments and optimization savings initiatives detailed earlier in the year and believe that taken together these various efforts position us to navigate the extraordinary market conditions seen in recent weeks and meet our expense goals. We're making good progress in lowering compensation and benefits costs, occupancy costs and other costs and IT costs are lumpy but on track too. Given the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenue, we obviously need to begin to intervene further on expenses and now expect to take them down 1% to 2% for the full year. This won't be easy, but we've begun to accelerate our plans and we'll adjust as we know more. First, as Ron mentioned earlier, for the remainder of the year unless the crisis concludes earlier, we will suspend most workforce reductions. We also instituted a hiring freeze for non-critical positions. Second, we see opportunities to dig deeper in non-compensation expenses, such as occupancy, contractors, travel and other professional fees. Third, we will be judicious about the reinvestments needed to drive growth in our business. And finally, we will adjust as the situation develops. Moving to slide 14, you can see that we maintained strong capital and liquidity levels during the first quarter with our standardized CET1 ratio, which was binding for first quarter ending at 10.7% and our LCR ratio essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. As you can see in the middle right panel, our SLR and Tier 1 leverage ratios ended at 5.4% and 6.1% respectively, with the sequential decline largely driven by an influx of flight-to-quality client deposits. We have the room to support our client activity under both ratios, especially given that the SLR would have been 7.1% post-implementation of Section 402 on April 1. During the quarter, we returned a total of approximately $683 million of capital to shareholders, including $500 million in share repurchases before we acting in coordination with other sub members of the Financial Services Forum agreed to temporarily suspend our repurchases in second quarter. We remain confident in our robust capital levels and our ongoing ability to continue to deploy our balance sheet to support our clients, the financial markets and the broader economy. Turning to slide 15 now, we've provided a summary of our first quarter results. As we mentioned earlier, throughout this crisis, we have been differentiating ourselves by proactively reaching out and assisting clients for these difficult times. Our resiliency during heightened volatility and our ability to execute record volumes without sacrificing service quality has created goodwill with our clients as we look to the future in the post COVID-19 time period. That said the potential length and depth of impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy has made the operating environment uncertain. This uncertainty, obviously, introduces a higher than usual degree of variability into our financial outlook. However, I would like to share our current expectations for the remainder of 2020 under a certain set of assumptions. While we believe these are reasonable set of assumptions, there is a broad range of possibilities regarding the potential length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the scale the economic impacts. As such, the current expectations we are providing today will represent one potential range of outcomes, but they are not representative of the full range of potential outcomes that may actually occur. So, with a very difficult second quarter economic situation in front of us, we assume global central banks keep short-term rates low and that long end rates then flowed up to about 80 basis points by year-end. We assume equity levels in second quarter to be consistent with March averages and potentially float up in the second half of the year. This will leave average equity market levels for 2020 lower as compared to 2019. Given these significant changes to the economic outlook, we currently expect that fee revenue will be down 1% to 2% year-on-year for full year 2020. Looking at the component pieces of our fee revenue; let me go through each one. Beginning with servicing fees, we expect they will be down 1% to 3%, driven largely by lower-than-expected market averages. We continue to see good underlying health and momentum in the servicing business, although there may be a slight slowdown in the sales pipeline over the near-term as clients adjust the new operating environment. Moving to management fees, we would expect now that they will be down 3% to 5% year-on-year, depending on equity market performance. I included in this outlook, the zero interest rate environment introduces the likelihood of money market fund fee waivers, which are highly sensitive to short-term rates and could have a modest impact of approximately $10 million to $40 million on our business, largely in the second half of the year. Our markets businesses will continue to be informed by the trading environment. We expect the spike in FX trading revenues will subside with market volumes and volatility, while securities finance will continue to be impacted by lower levels of leverage. Within software and processing fees, we remain confident in the CRD deal synergies. However, the uncertainty and the operational pressures introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic on the front office clients is now expecting to create go-live delays and slow down professional services projects of several current CRD clients. As a result, we now expect CRD revenue to be up mid-single-digit percentages year-on-year for full year 2020. At this time, we would expect software and processing fees ex-CRD, to likely be between $60 million and $70 million per quarter for the rest of the year, absent any further significant market-related adjustments. Regarding the second quarter of 2020, on a sequential quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be down 5% to 9% depending on our much lower equity market levels. The servicing fees towards the minus 5% end of the range, management fees coming in towards the minus 9% end of the range and considering some reversion in the trading revenues. Regarding NII, we still expect to be down approximately 10% year-on-year for full year 2020, as I previously indicated in mid-March, primarily driven by the impact of lower rates and the relatively strong performance in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we currently expect NII to be down about 11% quarter-on-quarter ex-episodic items, driven by the full quarter impact of lower rates. We expect NII to stabilize by the fourth quarter. Turning to expenses, even during this unprecedented period, we remain laser-focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and automation benefits. We expect that full year expenses, ex-notable items, will now be down 1% to 2%, exceeding our original goal of down 1%, as I mentioned earlier. In regards to our provision expense, 2Q results will be driven by updated economic forecast embedded in our new CECL models, plus any specific reserves. At the end of March, we assumed a number of factors in a range of scenarios for our general reserve. Among those numerous inputs, our dominant scenario had 2Q GDP of minus 12% and full year GDP of minus 2%. Had we moved to a different dominant scenario where full year GDP was minus 6%, for example, than we would have roughly built an additional $50 million of reserves. I'm simplifying, of course, and there are dozens of important variables, but this example gives you a taste of the sensitivity of the CECL reserving process to potential economic scenarios. On taxes, we continue to expect that we will land within the previously provided range of 17% to 19% for a tax rate for the full year, though some discrete items are expected to drive down that rate by about four percentage points lower for second quarter. And finally, we've again included our previously disclosed medium-term financial targets in our earnings presentation this morning because we believe they are the right targets. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of its impacts, raises the question regarding the timing of when we might realize those targets, which were set on a run rate basis for 2022. We are not changing the timing at this point, but we'll continue to monitor the length of the COVID-19 anticipated impact closely going forward. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRonald O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Great. Good morning, everybody. Eric, thanks for the updated detailed guidance. I guess first question maybe around deposits. So below March levels, but above, I guess, you said fourth quarter, obviously, it's a really wide spread there. So, maybe just give us a flavor for where deposits currently stay in April, sort of on average? And then importantly, as you guys think about the capacity to absorb any additional deposits or sustain the current levels, how should we think of that with respect to your capital leverage ratios? How much lower you guys would be able to take that?\nEric Aboaf: Alex, its Eric. Let me start on the deposits and just give you a little bit of texture on the trends, because I think that, that would help you. And obviously, the deposit levels move quite a bit. If you recall, back in fourth quarter, our deposit levels were about $165 billion in aggregate. And in January and February, they were literally just spot on to those averages. What started to change was the surge we saw at the beginning of March. And so, if we just think about the first half of March, we're running at about $185 billion of average total deposits. The second half of March spiked to $235 billion, and that together is what got us to a -- drove the higher averages for the quarter. And I think you saw our end-of-period print was north of $250 billion. And we literally operated at that level of deposits for about a week at the very end of the quarter. In terms of today, they’ve been running somewhere around $200 billion, $210 billion, so still hefty and I'll call kind of risk off levels. We're seeing that flight in [[h] quality and we're certainly there to support our clients. We do expect them to ebb down. And I think the question is, what's the pace of that? Do we get a resurgence or not? But there's a range of scenarios. What I would say is that the deposits now are a facilitation, a way for us to facilitate the needs of our clients, right? We're there for them on overdrafts, we're there for them on deposits, we're there for them on repo, we're there for them on supporting them at the Fed facilities, and I think we're delighted to do that as much as possible. In terms of the capacity, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we've got ample capacity at these levels of deposits to support our clients. You see our capital ratios, whether it's the SLR, post the April 1 change is quite high. And that can -- that's at -- on a reported -- on the new basis were about 7% against the 5% level. You see Tier 1 leverage. We still ran well this quarter, and that's against a 4% minimum. So, there's certainly some range. There's not unlimited range, but our perspective is that, if deposits stay in the asset levels that they are at today, the kind of $200 billion to $210 billion that's quite comfortable for us and we're here to do what we need to for our clients.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. That's helpful detail. Thanks for that. And then my second question is around CRD. So, revenue is about $100 million in the first quarter that's up only 1%, I guess, year-over-year. I think that business has been growing in the kind of high single-digit range, and you guys are obviously hoping to increase that further. So, is that sort of the impact of COVID-19 already playing out in the first quarter results? And that's really kind of the slowdown? Or is there something else going on? And I guess, as you look at the pipeline and the front-to-back wins that you guys have been highlighting over the last couple of quarters, any way to help us frame kind of the revenue backlog in that part of the business in timing to recognize it, understanding that, obviously, the current events could move that timing up and down, but just hoping to get some flavor there? Thanks.\nRonald O'Hanley: Alex, let me start on that, and then I'll turn it over to Eric. We remain very pleased with the impact that CRD is having on our business. The front-to-back pipeline continues to grow, and it's having CRD as part of that toolbox, if you will. And as I've mentioned before, in some cases, we don't end up, in the end with a full front to back, but we end up with a built-out relationship or even a relationship that we didn't have before. For example, the one front-to-back win that we had this quarter -- that we announced this quarter. It was not even an existing client of either CRD or State Street. So, from an overall enhanced State Street value proposition that's working well. As Eric noted, the reported revenues are very, very sensitive to the accounting rules and the accounting treatment. And we did -- it's very sensitive to when we're delivering things and if delivery gets changed or if the contours of something gets changed, it does affect the timing of reported revenue. So, strategically, this remains a very important and integral business for us. It's driving a lot of new activity. It's driving activity into the profitable back office for us. So, we remain unchanged, and it's important to us strategically. And Eric can talk about the actual financial impact that you're -- in your question?\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Alex, its Eric. So the quarterly revenues are always lumpy, and I'll just remind you that for a midsized client will bring in when it's on an on-premise basis, potentially $5 million, $10 million in a potential installation when it goes live. The smaller clients obviously, are $1 million, $2 million, $3 million. And so you can see, on a base of $100 million, you've got -- we could see big swings in growth rates, positive or negative. So I wouldn't read too much into that. What we have done is started to think through the likely revenues for the business this year. And this business in contrast to our servicing fee business, has more on-site kind of work that needs to be done. If there's on-site sort of co-development to integrate our platform within asset managers, there's professional services billings that also go with that. So, between the professional services billings just being slowed down with work from home, and then the go-live dates likely to be pushed out. I don't think there'll be -- we don't expect them to not be there, but we do expect some lengthening of those go-live dates. We're now looking at revenue growth at about 5%, 6%. We said mid-single-digits as opposed to the low-double-digits that we had expected this year. And we think that's mostly going to be around timing as opposed to underlying performance. The pipeline in CRD specifically is healthy. It's continued at the levels that it had been just a few months ago. And the interest in securing mandates from our clients, we think, it's actually as strong as ever.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks. Quick question on the loan book. So, I heard you loud and clear. Thank you on -- what the environment you underwrote to and what it could be in a worse environment in second quarter. So, it's -- I'm trying to think through -- if you look at the composition of loan book, fund finance and overdrafts, they don't scare me much. And my gut is not much of the reserves are focused on that. So, is it correct to say that most of the reserving goes towards the $4 billion levered loans and the $2 billion commercial real estate? And I'm just curious if you can contextualize a little bit more about quality of those portfolios. Specifically because what you said looks good, but 36%, 50%, it starts adding up in terms of just reserving. That's all.\nEric Aboaf: Glenn, its Eric. I think you've got the right frame of mind on the loan book, so a modest-sized loan book which is 10% of our total assets. And it's pretty diversified both across categories and then within categories. So, fund finance, as you mentioned, is primarily capital call finance loans with recourse to some of the largest in premier investors in the world, where -- that's a pretty attractive business area for us and one that's grown nicely. Leverage loans is an area that we -- obviously, in this environment, we'll spend a little extra time and I'll come back and talk about that in a moment and then commercial real estate overdraft munis are pretty straightforward. You are right to hypothesize that more than a majority of the reserves for our book is for the leverage loan book. And the reason we're reasonably comfortable with this book, do not have to say that things won't happen on an individual name here or there, is that it tends to be an upmarket book. Average rating is about BB as opposed to the average in the index is single B. And it's -- literally, the center of gravity is quite different. We've been tracking the market prices for this book. This book tends to have market prices as we've seen some change in the market to be six, seven points better than the typical -- than the average leverage loan index. So, it's performed well so far. And it's pretty well diversified. There aren't any particularly unusual exposures. There's not much oil and gas in it. So, we're -- we think it'll operate well during this time period. But I guess at the end of the day, it's a relatively high-grade version of leverage lending, and it's only $4 billion. And so we think it's -- it'll perform well and will just be a piece of the broader picture for the company.\nGlenn Schorr: Cool. I appreciate the perspective, one follow-up on just NII, overall. So keeping it at down 10 as the thought process for the year, but deposit book is a lot more. I'm just curious a lot of the deposits come in, in non-interest bearing. And so we'll see how long they sit there, but they're going to hang out for a little while, at least. I'm just curious, I know rates think, but we knew the rates were interesting. I'm curious why NII, with a greater deposit base wouldn't be a little bit less bad?\nEric Aboaf : Glenn, its Eric. I think you said it right. I won't repeat the five-letter word you use. But prevailing interest rates at the Central Bank, if you think of IOER as a benchmark are remarkably low, right? They're at 10 basis points. So, if you think about it, whether we taken a deposit at zero or taking a deposit at one, there's very little spread there. And so the value of the deposits, while they're there for -- they're there on our balance sheet, and we can lend against them, we can use them to support our other books, they're transient, by and large. And the value is small relative to what it's been. If you think back to the first quarter, on average, first quarter deposits were worth roughly 100 basis points. Just think about the cost of funds versus the IOER rate. In the second quarter, we expect deposits across the spectrum to be worth a fraction that closer to 10 basis points. So, it's just in an order of magnitude difference. And so, while we'll have -- we may have a surge or higher levels of deposits, we'll not be particularly renumerative this time around.\nGlenn Schorr: I got it. I appreciate it and thanks for all the guidance. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on your expectation on trading revenue. I know you referenced Eric that you expect it to subside. But can you help us with magnitude? How should we think about the potential decline from what you did in 1Q? Are you really just sort of expecting it to revert back to what we saw kind of like last year run rate? Or how should we calibrate? And what should we watch for as the year progresses?\nRonald O'Hanley: Brandon, that's a really good question and a real hard one to answer with any conviction. But let me share with you how we're thinking about it from a forecasting standpoint and then some of the possibilities. From a forecasting standpoint, our view is, by May and June, absent any other dramatic changes to the environment, the FX volumes will normalize back to what they were pre-crisis. And then that those levels, pre-crisis, will be what we should expect in third quarter and fourth quarter. Now, I'm saying all that, assuming that we have stability in equity markets, bond markets, global markets, and that's hard to predict. And, obviously, any further deterioration of the health situation or the economic situation is going to push us right back to where we were. So, -- and we're not hoping for that, we're hoping just for the opposite for the quieting of the enormous disruption that we've seen. All that said, there is a range of outcomes here, not just from the pandemic and its economic impact on markets like we saw in March. If we have a repeat of that in the coming months, and we could see some higher volumes again. But there's also a set of, if you think about the rest of the year, set of events, right? We've got Brexit continuing in some ways. We've got U.S. elections. We've done a series of different elements, I think, political, economic, global, world trade is going to come back at some point, and we'll have -- we may have tensions there. And so it's hard for me to really predict. And so, we tend to try to be careful with our forecast in FX, in particular, knowing that there certainly could be some upside. But I think we'll all see it when it happens and can probably factor that in.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then circling back as a follow-up to one of Glenn's questions on the loan book. Thanks for the additional disclosure there. The two biggest pieces are the fund finance and overdraft. Can you talk about any exposures that you might have in the fund finance book to mortgage REITs? What in that book makes you or your risk managers nervous, when they go to sleep at night? And obviously, it's not -- when we go into a market like this, it's not necessarily the stuff you always think that you need to worry about. Sometimes you get hit by surprise. So how can we -- how is it that you think about that book? How is it that, you risk managed? And how do you ensure that we don't end up in a situation, similar to what we had to a cycle where what we thought was good, like with the liquidity stops for the asset-backed commercial paper conduits, all of a sudden have become assets that end up coming back on the balance sheet and big headache to deal with.\nEric Aboaf: Yes, Brennan, it's Eric. Let me give you a little bit of texture perhaps on what's included in the $13 billion of fund finance, and how we think about it. And you can imagine, over the last month, between finance and our risk organization and our business teams, we spent extra time. And heightening our oversight and monitoring. But let me describe for you what we have there, and kind of how we think about the -- each of those books and maintaining the quality that we like. So, within fund finance, the largest piece is capital call financing. That's literally lines to some of the premier investors around the world, and that's done on a -- that's been allocated on a fund-by-fund basis. But the work that was goes on behind the scenes is that, each of those funds as a set of investors behind it. And what we need to do is maintain a diversified group of leads to those investors. And we want to avoid all concentration. So, there's a lot of work that gets done as we grow that book to make sure that there aren't any unknown concentrations or the concentrations are all within limits, on a literally an investor-by-investor basis, because that's where we have recourse. So, that's the primary approach on the capital call financing. The next piece within fund finance is the 40 Act liquidity funds that -- these are the funds that can have a certain amount of leverage. They're very well described, I think, in the 40 Act rules and they have limits on the amount of leverage they can. And there, the monitoring is what the asset pool? It's effectively a version of margin lending. What's the underlying asset pool? What are the line sizes? How do we constrain those appropriately and have our limit structures? And then there is literally the daily monitoring of that leverage in that margining. So, that's pretty straightforward in some sense. But, just like you say, you never say, never. And so, there's extra oversight in these volatile times to measure and to monitor the underlying collateral literally on a daily basis, as you'd expect. And then the smallest piece within fund finance is the BDCs. It's just over $1 billion. It tends to be BDCs with BBB pools of underlying loans. And so there, it's about diversification of the BDCs. They tend to be from some of the most premier alternative asset manager providers, right? Some of our largest clients because that's who we're trying to support there. And there, it's about a set of size limits and ongoing monitoring. So, that's maybe a little bit of texture. I think like I guess the frame of reference I'd give you is each of these a little different, and each of these have a different level of monitoring. And the process now, I think, like any bank, but ours is kind of simpler and more vanilla than most banks is to see if there're any -- if margin changes more than expected, occasionally you get questions around the possibility of adjusting covenants, and that's -- that quickly escalates. So that we have to make sure that how we react to those proactively and consciously. And sometimes we grant those and sometimes we grant those and actually ask the borrower to reduce their leverage or their -- or our exposure to -- our exposure to them. And so there's a -- I'd say there's a very natural set of actions that we use, both on a monitoring and intervention basis on an ongoing basis. But let me pause there with at least that texture.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes thanks. That’s great additional color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: -- comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKenneth Usdin: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could expand upon your comments you gave on CRD talking about that maybe the -- the cycle is a little bit slower there. Just in terms of your regular way servicing conversations that you're having with clients, giving the changes and how we're all working, how are those conversations going? Are -- does the -- how do you approach sales cycles? And moving forward with engagements that you've already been in process with in-sourcing new business? Thanks.\nRonald O'Hanley: Yes, Ken, the -- I mean, the level of engagement remains high and has continued to be high, even during this last month, five weeks of -- with almost everybody in the world working from home. And in fact, a new very large situation developed right in the middle of all this that we've started to work through. I would say that the underlying themes remain the same with this idea of improving and lowering costs of the asset managers or the asset owners. Cost structure of improving their operations, trying to do an outsource of things that are not really critical to their investment, but critical to achieving better outcomes, both for their clients and for themselves. I think what's changed and what's been added to the consideration now is all of the operational stress that's been applied to these managers since then. Many, many managers were not prepared for work from home, and they certainly weren't prepared for a global work from home. So, we see that, if anything, providing another catalyst to these kinds of, what we consider, fundamental enterprise outsourcing. And you can see that it's playing through even in our new business. The line that we focus on is new business, plus business to be installed. And as you can see, the business to the installed number remains quite high. And that reflects the fact that the business, increasingly is less about just a single product and much more about multiple initiatives, multiple kinds of offerings that we have underway for our clients. And we think -- see this continuing. We see this -- the need and desire to outsource at the extreme. You'll have clients that just have antiquated systems or operations that need fundamental upgrading. At the other extreme and we've experienced this, too highly successful managers and asset owners that are saying, we can do this, but it's not a good use of our time, and we want to be able to scale and we want to work with a partner that could be there for us. So, we see this whole trend continuing and probably accelerating.\nKenneth Usdin: Understood.\nEric Aboaf : I'd just add that we're also -- obviously, these -- the revenues this year are based on the of bookings and the wins from last year by and large, I think about the installation process. And so far, I think we've been pleased with the continued implementation. Our onboarding team has been active through the end of March on-boarding some sizable clients on schedule. April, we've -- we're halfway through April and have visibility of the rest of the month and are not seeing any unusual or major delays. And so for the time being and I think if we could get through March and April, the -- that will bode well. But the previously one business tends to be installed on schedule because it needs to be, right? You've got the previous provider who needs to come off. You've got a lot of preparation that's been done. And so, so far, we've actually seen good progress or good continuity on the onboarding side, which is important because that's when the revenues tend to begin to be accrued.\nKenneth Usdin: Understood. And the follow-up, just on the buyback side, you guys were part of the financial services form agreement to stop buybacks through the second quarter. But obviously, not being a credits -- as credit-sensitive of an institution. And just looking at the results this quarter, it would seem that you guys would have capacity to continue a buyback regardless of what the credit environment turned into. I'm just wondering just your thoughts on whether or not if the rest of the forum has to decide to continue to stop buybacks for longer than the second quarter, would you have to be a part of that? Or could you make -- start making your own decisions based on your own capacity to do so? Thanks.\nRonald O'Hanley: Yes, Ken. We should be clear. We make our own decisions on this. We are part of the forum. We talked forum and we considered it actually a very good move to make to instill confidence in the system and to -- remember this happened at a time where people were questioning whether or not banks would be there. And we -- I felt it was not going to be useful for us to not be part of this and to have more time spent on, why are the one or two outliers as opposed to the banks are committed to being there during the crisis. But we make our own decisions. You're right. We are very different, and our results will play out differently than credit intensive banks. So, the good news is that with the new rules that are being implemented, capital planning can be much more dynamic than it has been in the past. And we'll take advantage of that as the situation plays out. I mean, the realities are that it's still highly uncertain. You heard that -- and the environment is highly uncertain. You heard that reflected in the assumptions upon which we based our guidance to you. One could argue that we've been very conservative, but one could argue also that the situation could get a lot worse than what our -- what we put out there as a point estimate. That's exactly what we've done. We've given a point estimate within a wide range of potential outcomes. The market level one is the biggest one. And there the assumption is, is that average markets will be what they were at period end March. I mean, that's -- we're already much -- the spot levels are higher than that. So, we really don't know here, which is why going back to your question on capital, if this all plays out as we see, we believe we'll be in a position to distribute capital, but we think it's wise to be able to make that decision dynamically quarter-to-quarter.\nKenneth Usdin: Understood. If I can just ask a quick follow-up, Eric, just on one of your prepared remarks. The 10 to 40 of the potential fee waivers, that's not dissimilar to what happened prior cycle. Is that just like an aggregate number, like what could happen on a full year basis as opposed to a quarterly basis?\nEric Aboaf: Ken its Eric. Yes, that's for the rest of the year, primarily in the second quarter. I gave you a large range, because it's also highly dependent on short rates, right? If the overnight repo rates are one or two basis points or six or seven or 10 or 11, you literally -- you could go from zero to the -- to what could be the upper end of that range. But that would have been for the rest of the year, and it would be primarily in the second half.\nKenneth Usdin: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi good morning.\nRonald O'Hanley: Good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the expense side. I know you indicated that you're looking at everything. And now we're anticipating that you're going to be able to bring expenses down 1% to 2% more than the prior commentary around down 1%. And I just wanted to understand where -- in an environment where you're not doing any redundancies, obviously, this year, could you speak to where there's some opportunity set to dig into that?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Betsy its Eric. The opportunity set is broad and it's a set of initiatives that we had underway. And in the spirit of -- when things are tougher, you've got to act more dramatically, is I think the theme that I share with you. So, if you think about the different areas of our expense base, the compensation benefits line won't be as much of a tailwind as we've, I think, made a very conscious and appropriate choice on protecting our people. But if you think about the expense base, that's only about half of the expense base. And even within the compensation benefits line, for example, there are contractors, there's significant amount of contractors that we employ. And if you think about it, if we're going to end up with a larger employee workforce than we expected, right? Contractors could be an area that we -- where we adjust. So, it's that kind of action. Occupancy is another natural one, whoever thought that you could run a company at a 80% or 90% work from home, but it does give us a real perspective as we have lease rollovers or where we might have been planning on taking additional leases, and there's always a role instead of either potential exits or ads that you're doing as you load balance. You can imagine, we've got lease ads on a complete moratorium. And where we had rollovers, you can imagine, we're now starting to move in the opposite direction and say, hey, why can't I let this space go? And when employees do come back, I want all my employees back, but we clearly have more flexibility than we ever would. So, that's another example. Third one might be around all the other expenses in technology, there's software, there's hardware purchases, et cetera. While our teams are spending time on supporting clients and literally hourly daily basis, it's also a natural time for us to slow some of our purposes of capital equipment or software, doesn't say we won't come back and naturally think about outspending some of that in the future, but it does mean that we can slow some of those purchases because it's -- we've shifted some of our time and energy to more immediate situation as opposed to some of the medium term investments. So, I think that's the other one, which is the -- kind of the reinvestment. We'll naturally slow to some extent. And if you remember the chart we did at the fourth quarter earnings call in January, we showed expenses down 1%. Now, we're saying down 1% to 2%. But within that, there was 3% or 4% increase in investments of expenses due to investments and 4% to 5% decrease going in the other direction. And so part of what we're doing is also, I think, being more disciplined about those reinvestments that we're doing now and pacing them.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. No, it's interesting too on the occupancy side because while you might have people come back to work over time, you might not be as densely organized as you have been in the past. So, that's one of the reasons why I was kind of interested in can you actually reduce occupancy or not, but definitely makes sense on the lease rollovers and additional leases, at least for the near-term. Are you still -- go ahead.\nRonald O'Hanley: What I would add to Eric's comments or a couple. We have had underway, as you would know, a lot of work on process redesign and automation, and that work is not stopping, right? How we -- how and when we realize the benefits of it may change and be delayed, but the work is not stopping. And so -- and if anything, we're redoubling our efforts there. So, I would just note that we've got this moratorium, and we absolutely think it's the right thing to do. But our work, both in IT and operations, and then how we connect with our clients that remains -- we're working full speed on that. The other point I'd make on the leases is that I agree with your point that we probably won't be as dense for a long period of time, at least until there's a vaccine. But I think it's surprised everybody, not just at State Street, but elsewhere, how effective one can be in work from home. And I would have to believe that over the medium and long-term, that you'll see us having less space than we do today.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Are you still going to be moving your headquarters?\nRonald O'Hanley: We are. And that was always a natural financial benefit to us. So that's still underway for the end of 2022.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just focus on the average balance sheet in terms of the non-U.S. deposit rates of negative 20 basis points. If you could just go into that dynamically? What's driving that? I think that there may be FX swap expense against that. And then also just a commentary on the driver of the episodic -- or the net interest income that you described as episodic in the quarter? And then also, you mentioned 10 basis points on deposits in a prior comment. I missed what that deposit level was linked to?\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Let me -- Brian, let me take those in order. So on the average balance sheet, you're right. The non-U.S. deposit costs fell, they were minus four basis points or minus 20 basis points. It's literally the effect of the FX swaps, which are diagrammed out in the footnote on that page. I think it's page seven of the financial addendum. And as well as some modest reductions in interest rates in foreign jurisdictions, right? Some of the European and Asian central banks drop rates, and so that will flow through that line as well. In terms of the NII that we reported in first quarter, we did note that there was about $20 million of higher-than-usual NII separate from the deposits. The deposits for welcome and additive NII. But away from deposits and loans and investments, the $20 million was really split into two. About half of that was literally the hedging effect that goes through. We hedge either debt or the rate coupons on some of the loans, and that creates a mark-to-market as you've got changes in the debt market. So it's worth about half of the $20 million. And the other half was actually some good positioning that we took in the quarter with the influx of deposits and in particular dollar deposits, we were dollar rich. Dollars were quite valuable. And so we -- the treasury team did quite well to invest those in either yen or euros. They're kind of one and two-day overnight basis swaps and that was renumerative to us. And at the same time, it was helpful to either clients or counterparties in those foreign jurisdictions who were $1 poor and needed some of the access to the dollars that we could provide. So those were the two components of the $20 million. Finally, on the deposits, what I did say to one of the earlier questions is the value of deposits has changed significantly in P&L terms. I mean, the value of deposits always high on a balance sheet basis and not that we needed more deposits. But we were happy to accept them from our clients. The point that I made is that the level of deposits in the first quarter and then last year were a big -- had a large impact to NII, because the kind of typical deposit. Let me kind of use that in very broad swap might have been worth 100 basis points, think about the cost we would have paid on average for the deposits, saying in the U.S., versus the IOER rate at the Fed. That would be kind of a simple approximation. If you fast forward in, say, in April or in second quarter, how valuable is that same mix of U.S. deposits? It's much less. It's closer to 10 basis points. And why is that? It's because our cost of funds -- the cost of those deposits to us could be zero or one basis points or two or three. But we reinvest them at IOER rates of 10 basis points. And so what we effectively had is a very large change in the value of incremental deposits between kind of the pre the Fed moves and then post Fed move. So, that was the point I was making. So the profit will matter a little bit to NII in the -- going forward, but not nearly as much as they would have mattered in the past.\nBrian Bedell: Right. That's very clear. Okay. And then just on the CRD commentary on the delay. Obviously, that makes sense given what's going on at work from home. Is -- can you comment on whether you think you're still on track for the 2021 revenue and expense synergies and the net benefit of $75 million to $85 million on EBIT on the revenue side net of investments and, I think, $55 million to $65 million on the cost side. Whether you think that sort of gets also pushed out with delay in implementations? And then the timing of the $1 trillion left to install in the servicing business, is that also delayed by COVID-19?\nRonald O'Hanley: Brian, let me take those two different, but related questions. On Charles River, we're still quite confident in the revenue and expense synergies. The expense ones are something we do as a matter of course. And you can imagine, we'll actually try to accelerate those a bit, but those are on track. And then on the revenue side, a good bit of those synergies are actually coming from some of our trading businesses as we plug-in our FX and securities lending and other markets activities into Charles River, and that's on schedule and moving along at pace. So, we're currently confident in our delivering on the synergies for Charles River. On the servicing side, as I mentioned, the client on-boarding has stayed on track in March and April and so as we think about the time line of that $1.1 trillion to be installed for the servicing business, we think that will play out during the year. If you recall, I've talked about those wins and some of those wins are fast to install, say something like custody. And others, where it's a mix of custody and accounting and, perhaps, some of the offshore cross-border products, those tend to take longer. When you add middle office, it takes even longer. And -- but those are all part of the standard course of business. And we don't, at this point, see a slowdown in the implementation on onboarding rates. And so far, our clients are eager to move forward. Because in some ways, remember that business that we won came with some fee adjustments. Clients are -- want to conclude on those and so they need to implement the service. And so those are now because they're paired up, I think we'll stay on track on both sides.\nBrian Bedell: Great color. Thanks very much for all the detail.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael Carrier: Thanks. Good morning. Just two quick follow-ups. First, on CRD. Just in terms of the mid-single-digits versus double-digits, I just want to make sure from an understanding, like if we get to 2021 and, let's say, there are medical treatments and most people are back to work, would you expect like a pretty significant acceleration or from like a headcount or what like people can actually accomplish, would you just go back to sort of the low-double-digits? Like would you get that acceleration? Or is it just not possible just given like the timing of the implementation how much the people power that takes?\nRonald O'Hanley: Yes, let me begin on that. I think that as Eric noted, we stand by the 2021 synergies that we laid out there. And I think what's happening here is that, the pipeline that Charles River would have seen versus the pipeline that it's seeing now is quite different. It tends to be larger, more complicated and sophisticated clients. It tends to be part of a multiproduct installation. So, what you're seeing is it's just taking longer to install and therefore for the part of the deal that gets credited to Charles River, it's just taking longer for that to happen. And in fact, you're seeing now in the current installations, two very large installations underway, one of which has been out there since before we acquired the firm and that's changed over time, and that's delayed the revenue recognition. So, over the long-term -- over the medium and long-term, do we believe that this business can grow faster under us than it was prior to us? Yes, we do.\nMichael Carrier: Okay. And then just on FX. The comments that you made makes sense. Given some of the investments that you guys have made in the platform, when you've seen the uptick in volatility, has there been any kind of increases in like clients that the number of products that could be sustainable if we continue to get some level of volatility? Obviously, we'll get a moderation, but maybe have you seen anything in terms of traction on that platform at the new level could be at a higher pace?\nRonald O'Hanley: Yes. We -- market share is a hard thing to measure in this business because nobody uses just 1 provider. But we have invested heavily over the past couple of years in this era of low volatility to build market share to show and demonstrate the clients, the capabilities that we have, and that really helped when it came time. And the team came through and the transactions occurred really difficult roles, period end roles that were going to be hard to execute, got done, and clients remember that. So, we think this market share that we've built will last for us. As Eric noted, what we saw was just immense volatility, an immense kind of move from risk-on to risk-off assets, including moves out of certain base currencies to others and all crisis driven. So if we see that again, then there's lots of bad news elsewhere. Will we likely see -- or could we likely see is maybe a better way to describe it, volumes higher than what we've seen in the 2018-2019 timeframe? Possibly, right? Because I think we'll be in an era of -- I mean, almost any forecast, one would have to believe has some level of heightened risk. The other thing too is, I mean, we saw our giant rotation out, particularly of emerging markets. I mean, at some point, there'll be a rotation back, and that tends to be also beneficial to us too. So, again, we gave you an estimate and we tried to be conservative here, recognizing the range of -- or the amount of uncertainty and therefore the range of possible assumptions. But there certainly is a case where one could expect to see not sustained levels, at least in our forecast that we saw in Q1, but levels above what we've seen in the prior four to eight quarters.\nMichael Carrier: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is open.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Good morning. Just one question -- maybe kind of an update on where we're at in April, if you look at the balance sheet, you had the overdraft that came in at the end of the quarter. You also had the $27 billion of investment securities from the MMLF that were on the balance sheet. And then maybe could you just give an update on where those stand? Those just roll back off now that things have kind of stabilized? And also the same with the money microphone flows? I mean, what are you seeing thus far in April?\nEric Aboaf: Brian, it's Eric. The end-of-period balance sheet is a good starting point for -- to follow-up on that question. And here's how I'd frame it. I think the MMLF balance is, we're at about $27 billion at the end of the reporting period on March 31. And they've been in that range, I mean, plus/minus a few billion dollars has we've been in that range for the first two weeks of April. And then deposits, which had spiked to just over $250 billion or probably closer to $200 billion to $210 billion.  So it's really the deposit -- the reduction in deposits that are adjusting the balance sheet down by call it, $50 billion end of period relative to what we saw. There will be a few other smaller movements. Overdrafts have continued to float back down to more traditional levels, the mark on the forwards and the FX books have started to revert. So, there's a few billion here or there and a couple of other areas, but the biggest one is the guidance, I gave on deposits coming down by about $50 billion from the end-of-period levels, will be the biggest change so far that we see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Mayo: Hi. Ron, can you talk about the trade-off of basically offense versus defense, the tone that you're sending to the company? When I think of offense, I think of long-term market share, helping out the government being part of the solution, like you're doing with the money market. Maybe more help as the Fed expands its balance sheet, gaining share versus smaller competitors by doing a little bit extra. When I think of defense, I think of short-term hunker down, live to quite another day, like what you're doing more for employees, you're not buying back stock. And then maybe even for clients, if they're not making you as much money, still kind of living with that. So how do you think about that trade-off in this unusual world?\nRonald O'Hanley: Well, it's -- Mike, it can't be one or the other. But I would say that, particularly since we feel like over the last year, year-and-a-half, we've gotten a very good handle on our expenses, not just from an expense level, but how we manage those expense levels, how we manage the productivity. I think you will find that our tone and our actions are mostly around offense. Certainly, as it relates to clients, we have had unparalleled levels of client communication and client engagement. And if anything, the time in working from a home cause people to redouble and re-triple their efforts to be there to support clients. And that will pay off for years to come. So, we think that, in the short-term, we have to be protecting our employees, both their -- physically and mentally. And we think we've taken the appropriate actions there, but we don't think we've taken them at the expense of any kind of long-term opportunity creation for ourselves and our shareholders.\nMichael Mayo: And as it relates to clients, you mentioned the rotation out of emerging markets, historically; an emerging markets equities fund would generate higher custody fees than a plain vanilla bond portfolio. So, if people move out of high-risk into lower-risk, wouldn't that hurt fees to assets under custody? And maybe you're doing a little bit extra for clients, even though you're not getting paid as much?\nRonald O'Hanley: Yes. Well, my reference to emerging markets, I mean, that rotation was happening, and just if anything has played itself out even further over the last month. I don't believe that, that's makes sense over -- certainly, it doesn’t make sense over the long-term. It won't make sense over the medium term. And we would expect to see as the situation -- as the situation stabilizes and investors start looking at relative valuations around the world, they'll see the -- just the value opportunities in emerging markets. So, I wasn't suggesting even a greater rotation, rotations largely happen. The question is when will the rotation back occur?\nMichael Mayo: I just -- then in terms of, if there's risk off, does that mean clients go to more plain vanilla portfolios where you get less fees?\nRonald O'Hanley: Yes. Well, certainly, in the short-term, that's what they're doing, right? I mean, it's -- you're seeing a giant push into cash, but at the levels that investors are getting paid and the amount of stimulus, first, monetary and increasingly fiscal that's going to be put in. Again, one person's opinion. I think that the more likely long-term trend is for risk assets, particularly equities to continue to provide superior returns. And in a period of uncertainty like this, which is not only uncertain, but previously unknown, you're not going to see as much in the short-term until there is more certainty. But all of the ingredients are in place, low -- lots of monetary stimulus, lots of cash in the system, low interest rates, to see a return to risk on at the appropriate time.\nMichael Mayo: And then, one more follow-up, Eric, were on. Just, look, do you -- anything you can glean from what's happening in Asia or outside the U.S. that gives you extra insight to the U.S., especially like what percentage of your workforce is the office in Asia at this point versus the U.S.? Or any other trends or like, I said insight since you are in more than one country, obviously?\nRonald O'Hanley: Yes. So -- and probably China, our Hangzhou operation is a great example of what we can expect worldwide. We started -- we were given the go-ahead to start returning employees there back in the middle of March. And we're now back up to about 75% -- between 75% and 80% back to work. And we've actually metered that. We -- as we've noted earlier, we have not densified the office as much. We've put -- we've got testing facilities on the way in. Initially, people were wearing mask. And now you're seeing a much more normal working environment. And I think that will stay for as long as there's not another outbreak. What we're seeing elsewhere, in Asia is, not quite as fast to return to work. But -- but you're also seeing guidelines kind of ebb and flow, as you see periodic outbreaks. And I think that's probably what we're going to live with around the world. I don't think this will be a straight-line recovery, in terms of whether it's back to work or back to gatherings. I think that there will be periodic outbreaks. Businesses and governments will need to respond to those. They're not going to respond in the same way, if the lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong or anything they'll be very targeted guidelines. For example, in Singapore, they just recently limited restaurants, again, but they didn't send everybody home from work. So, I think that's what you can expect to see, if you will, a steady recovery back over time. But with some lumpiness along the way as there are outbreaks, until we get to a -- until we get first to testing, and then to widespread availability of vaccines.\nMichael Mayo: That's great. And how many employees you have in China because that's a fascinating specific, 75% to 80% are back to work in China?\nRonald O'Hanley: 3,000 in China, the vast majority of them, 2,800, in our Hangzhou facility.\nMichael Mayo: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi Eric. Good morning. So Eric, I wanted to ask a question on the securities portfolio. Just given your heavier mix towards fixed versus floating, I think in the 10-K, you sighted a longer duration of around 2.7 years for your book, relative to where some of your peers are managing it. I'm just wondering what causes the NII to stabilize by year-end, just given some of the reinvestment headwinds could persist. And maybe if you could frame what reinvestment yield or level you're assuming, versus the 200 basis points of the securities bookings earnings today?\nEric Aboaf: Steven, its Eric. There are a number of factors that you've got to assemble to really predict the path of NII. And in our 10-K, we tend to assemble them all together. And the securities portfolio is just one of them. If you think about the average duration of our balance sheet, you are right. The securities portfolio has an average duration of 2.6, 2.7 years. But the rest of the asset side of the balance sheet is actually much more floating rate. And remember, the securities portfolio is ex the MMLF to keep it simple is call it, just shy of $100 billion out of a $250 billion typical balance sheet. So it's an important piece, but it's not the only piece. The effect of that is that the average duration of the asset side of the balance sheet that we have is about 1.3 years, so about half of the duration of the securities portfolio. And it's that -- and that shorter net asset or the lower duration of the total asset side of the balance sheet is what creates a re-pricing that tends to be a little faster than you would have expected by just thinking about the investment portfolio. So, as we've played that through our models and, obviously, in our models, there are a lot of different factors, but those two are important ones. You see a step down from first quarter to second quarter that's significant. I gave an indication of that. We see another step down, but not as large in percentage terms from second quarter to third quarter. And then starting in the fourth quarter, you see a fair amount of stability between fourth quarter and then our guesstimates of what we might see in the first and second quarter of 2021. And part of that is that you've got the interest rate effects playing out. Then you've got some natural balance sheet growth, which creates a bit of a tailwind. And so once we get through the bulk of the interest rate effect, which happens in the first couple of quarters, the headwinds and the tailwinds tend to roughly even out, which is why we think we'll see some stability from the fourth quarter onwards.\nSteven Chubak: Okay. Thanks for that, Eric, really helpful color. The one piece you, I was hoping you could clarify is what reinvestment yield or level are you assuming on the securities book?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, the -- I'm trying to think about a good way to describe that to you. So, our investment portfolio yield right now is about just over 2%. And that will -- that's been -- that floated down just marginally, but that's because rates fell quickly towards the very end of the quarter. If I think about reinvestment levels in the portfolio, I guess we could talk about new investments, what's rolling off. There's a lot of ins and outs of that. Maybe the better way to describe it is that the average yield on the portfolio is about 2% on average for first quarter. If we start to think about what's the average yield in second quarter and maybe in the third and fourth quarter, we're closer to about 1.5% kind of roughly if I eyeball what the averages will look like. And that will be driven by the new roles being added and the old roles coming off. But that's probably a good rough amount, a good rough estimate for you.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that, Eric. And just one more follow-up, if I may. Lots of helpful detail in the loan mix and composition. There were provisions that you reported was a mealy a bit lighter than peers. If we compare your reserve levels versus DFAST losses, on that screen or on that basis, you look a bit under reserve. But if you look at your company run stress tests, it looks like you're being in line with the rest of the peer group. And so just given that a lot of investors are using the Fed stress test in the DFAST as a framework for forecasting provisions, I was hoping you could clarify or speak to some of the differences in what the Fed assumes versus what you guys are assume for your company run? And why you're comfortable modeling lower losses relative to the Fed?\nEric Aboaf: Steve its Eric. So, a couple of perspectives there some of which you touched on and others, which I'll add. I think first, we added to a reserve about $35 million. So, the reserve was up about one-third. And I think when I scanned across peers, you saw reserve increases of anywhere between 30% and 50% on corporate books. So, I think we're -- we made the right upward adjustment just given what we do at the time and what our forecasts were as of March 31. In terms of comparing the reserves to say, the CCAR losses, either the Fed model or our own models or to loans, I think that's where the mix of the loan book is in -- at all those ratios is incredibly sensitive to the mix of the loan book. If you think about it, our fund finance loans and one could go back to the last crisis, the 2008 crisis, performed particularly well. And so we've got to factor that into our reserving. And what I would say is that the reason the fed both does its math on estimated losses under CCAR and then asks us to do our math, is not just to say, hey, there will be a natural bid ask, but it is to reflect the different nature of the books. If you think about it, I think the Fed spent an enormous amount of time as you would expect on what is the typical mid-market corporate lending book going to result in, in terms of losses? Or what's the typical credit card book that it's -- and how will it perform under stress? I would think that, while they have extensive modelers, they probably spent a little less time on our fund finance to capital call line book just because it's small and it's not widespread around the industry. So, I would at least say that in our particular circumstances, the company run stress tests that you've been referencing are in our mind is a good indicator of credit under stress and May. But I'll be sensitive to it because all models are informative, maybe a bit more indicative than some of the Fed models just because they tend to be much more averaged across more kind of a non-custodial set of banks.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks so much for your helpful color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nRobert Wildhack: Good morning guys. In the slide deck, you called out some pricing headwinds contributing to both sequential and year-over-year declines in the servicing fee line. Can you just expand on what you're seeing there? And then more broadly, what are your thoughts on pricing from here given the shift in the macro? Thank you.\nRonald O'Hanley: Why don't I begin--?\nEric Aboaf: Hey, Bob, it's-\nRonald O'Hanley: Why don't I start, Eric? In terms of -- I'll start with your second question -- on the second part of your question, Eric will answer the first. We have spent a lot of time with our clients. Remember, we've got a fairly concentrated book of business. Our 100 largest clients constitute a big portion of the total. And we're through 80-plus percent of that, we've gotten term out of a lot of them. But more importantly, we've just learned how to do this better than we have in the past. So, while, for sure, our clients will be under their own sets of stress as a result of this, we are not anticipating a heightened level of price compression. Part of it is that it's a given -- if you think about the way that we're remunerated in a client relationship, a part of that is NII and they can see as well as we can that that is -- that the source of return is going away. So, we think it's reasonable to assume that the pricing, as we've said before, will -- pricing pressure is abating, that it will continue to abate and level out at a normal level, which is -- it's not going to go away, but it will be a normal level as opposed to what it's been over the past couple of years and nothing that we've seen this year so just anything different on that.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Rob, it's Eric. I'd just add that pricing has been a natural part of this custody business for decades. And what we're doing in the disclosure on the slide deck is literally given you for servicing fees, what's the very transparent roll forward and net new business flows and client activity, which were up this quarter actually was a tailwind, market appreciation and depreciation and then pricing going the other way. So, it's just part of our natural disclosure now and on a going-forward basis. But as Ron said, we expected a certain amount of pricing to come through during this year at that kind of 3% level, so down from the 4% headwinds we saw last year. And we're -- everything we're seeing suggests that we're on track for that currently and it will be -- it will moderate from last year's levels, so in line with what we currently expect.\nRobert Wildhack: Got it. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, Ron. Good morning, Eric.\nRonald O'Hanley: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Eric, thank you for the detail on the loan portfolio, very helpful. As another question, on that leveraged loan portion of the portfolio, are you primarily a participant in those loans, the syndicated type loans? Or are you the lead? And then second, are they all subject to the shared national credit exam process?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard its Eric. I think the answer is an easy yes to both of those. So we tend to be a participant in a set of syndicates with the other large banks and work closely with them. We'll occasionally, but we tend to be a participant at the table. And we tend to operate within syndicates of sister banks that we feel when they lead are very thoughtful about credit and credit appetite because it's not just a particular loan, but it's the covenants, it's the terms and conditions that matter. And so the choice we make of which syndicates to join, and which lead banks to partner up with is important. So -- but that tends to be our position to participate. And then absolutely, we participate in the SNC reviews and SNC tests. And so that's a way for us to, I think, for the industry and for our supervisors to make sure that we evaluate credit consistently. I think what's helpful about leverage loans is they're also traded in the marketplace. So, there's an external market benchmark, and that's -- they are external ratings. And oftentimes there are prices, but there's also the SNC review process. We participate in that. And so we feel like we've got a very good read into the quality and health and -- of our book. And as I mentioned, it tends to be double the average book with actually some BBBs and higher and just very few under the BB level.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. And then just a quick follow-up. You gave us good information on the positive flow and what you saw at the end of the quarter and what's happened since then. Can you share with us what were the customers, or who are the customers that were the primary drivers of that deposit inflow? And then are they the same customers that are withdrawing now or is it a different group that are actually withdrawing the deposits?\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Gerard, let me give you a little bit of texture because if you think about our client base, it's asset managers, asset owners, alternative providers, insurance, a wide breadth. I think what we -- what we saw is that while they all tended to become more liquid and go to cash, and so we had some increase in deposits from across all those segments, the single largest area came from our asset managers. And sometimes, it was the asset managers who were running money funds and they were derisking those funds and then leaving the deposits with us. And sometimes it was just the asset managers running various funds that we custody for equity funds, bond funds, U.S., international, et cetera, where they were derisking within those funds and shifting to cash. And so those are probably the two different factors within asset management -- asset manager complexes. And it's that cash that's come back and sits on our balance sheet. And so I think part of what we're watching for is how quickly does that cash get reinvested versus how liquid do those managers want to stay, whether it's the kind of money market complexes they run? And so sometimes they stay in cash as opposed to even buying short and medium-term treasuries. Or how risk off some of the long players or even the alternative providers want to be. But those are the factors, and it was primarily around asset managers. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're delighted to make our balance sheet available to them, both on the -- as they have these flight to quality deposits or even operationally as we support them with overdrafts, because that's -- both of those are important parts of our business. In addition, even to some of the off-balance sheet activity, the sponsored repo and other facilitation that we provided, let's get another source of liquidity as well.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Ron O'Hanley for closing remarks.\nRonald O'Hanley: Thank you, operator, and thanks to all on the call. Thanks for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ronald O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thanks Ilene and good morning everyone. You will have seen that today, we released our first quarter earnings results. I am pleased with our performance during such turbulent times, and I am proud of our team members worldwide who achieved these results. The COVID-19 health crisis has necessitated a rapid curtailment of economic activity, which in turn has driven significant financial market volatility and a lack of liquidity in some fixed income markets. The markets in general and State Street specifically, have withstood the volatility well. Central banks moved quickly to help alleviate market stress and State Street's long-standing business continuity planning, supplemented by rapid innovation, has enabled us to operate, protect our employees, and serve our clients exceptionally well. Throughout this period, we have continued to execute against our strategy, which is reflected in our strong performance. Before discussing our quarterly financial performance, I want to review some of the actions that we have taken in support of our clients and to protect the safety of our global workforce, all while remaining focused on State Street's operational excellence, resiliency and business performance. Turning to slide three, I will outline some of the key aspects of State Street's response to the pandemic. As a global company operating in 29 countries, we have been addressing the coronavirus since its very inception with significant operations and approximately 3,000 employees in China, we had somewhat of a head start on adapting our global operating model to the rapidly changing needs of our clients as well as to the safety concerns of our approximately 39,000 employees across the globe. Our actions in response to this global health crisis have centered on maintaining employee safety and business continuity and resilience, while concurrently supporting our clients, the financial markets, and the broader economy. Let me start with our people. Here, our Senior Global Crisis Team has worked continuously since mid-January with local management and relevant authorities across the world to safeguard employee health and wellbeing. Our IT capabilities rapidly allowed us to add capacity for remote access solutions, while also maintaining cyber safety. And today, approximately 90% of our global workforce is working from home. We announced that through the end of the year, we suspended any workforce reductions other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID-19 crisis. I believe this is the right decision for our people, our clients and our communities. It aligns with our culture and values and reflects our financial strength. We are undertaking actions to offset the cost of this decision, which we will describe later in the presentation. Let me turn to our clients in the broader markets. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and the pace and timing of an economic recovery will influence investor behavior, financial market conditions, and our clients, who are the owners and managers of the world capital. State Street plays a central role in the infrastructure of the global financial system. This crisis has demonstrated our deep operational capabilities at a time of significantly increased business volumes. Our global operating model has enabled us to run split operations where we can efficiently transfer work with minimal disruption to client service at a time when we have seen a significant expansion in activity. For example, in March, we experienced a 50% increase in back-office transactions and an over 80% increase in middle office transactions. Similarly, valuation checks for NAV calculations due to significant asset price moves, which typically run at approximately $70,000 per day; it is high as $1 million per day at the height of the market volatility. Due to the scale and reach of the current COVID-19 crisis, asset owners and asset managers have been impacted globally with many struggling to cope with market disruptions, reduced workforces, limited access to normal workplace infrastructure, and continuing uncertainty. To assist these clients, we have focused on a number of priorities during the last few weeks. First, we have increased our level of client engagement and communication ensuring we better understand client needs and how we can rapidly assist them in this unique and challenging environment. Second, we are maintaining a state of operational readiness through increased IT resource capacity with strong and tested business continuity plans put into action, as I mentioned earlier. Third, we are providing a suite of liquidity solutions. State Street has a range of short-term cash investment options for our clients, including deposits, centrally clear repo and access to a full range of money market funds via our investment portal Fund Connect. Global Advisors also has a number of specialized cash strategies. In addition, our global credit finance team supports clients with overdraft capacity and committed lines of credit. We also stand ready to support the broader economy. State Street is actively assisting our clients to tap various Federal Reserve programs that support the flow of liquidity and credit, facilitating approximately 50% of money market mutual fund liquidity facility, or MMLF usage, while also serving as the custodian and accounting administrator for the commercial paper funding facility. Many clients appreciated that we worked closely with the Federal Reserve to set up the MMLF and enable clients to access liquidity even before it's fully operational, which helped clients stabilize their funds. As we look out over the longer term, the evolving needs of all of our clients are at the center of our strategy to continue to be our clients' essential partner and provide the technology and scale they need to grow when the current uncertainty dissipates and global macroeconomic conditions recover. We believe this crisis will only accelerate the desire of clients to outsource more of their operations and partner with a fully capable front-to-back provider like State Street. Turning to slide four, I am pleased by the direction and progress of our strategy as demonstrated by our strong first quarter performance. Relative to the prior year period, first quarter total revenue increased 5%, and on a sequential quarter basis, total revenue increased 1%. First quarter EPS was $1.62, up 37% year-over-year, and ROE was 10.9%. I am pleased to report that our first quarter pretax margin improved by over three percentage points to 25.6%, excluding notable items. Despite the unprecedented levels of equity market volatility during the first quarter, our results benefited from the relatively stable domestic equity market averages relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. Market averages were materially higher than the year ago period as a result of the dramatic global equity market sell-off in late 2018. Industry flows were positive in aggregate as investors move from long mutual fund positions into ETFs and money market bonds. At State Street, we saw a particularly strong recovery in U.S. flows relative to the first quarter of 2019. While FX volatility remained at low levels for the first half of the quarter, our results, ultimately, benefited from materially higher levels of FX volatility experienced during the latter half of the quarter and the market tumult associated with COVID-19. That volatility, plus our multi-year innovation investments, led to record FX results. First quarter NII benefited from significantly higher deposit levels as clients turn to us as part of their flight to quality, despite dramatic long and short end rate reductions. Assets under custody and administration fell 7% quarter-over-quarter to $31.9 trillion as a result of lower period end market levels. We saw a healthy level of new wins during the quarter, totaling $171 billion. Assets yet to be installed stood at $1.1 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, assets under management fell 14% quarter-over-quarter to $2.7 trillion as a result of lower period end equity market levels. Global advisers recorded $39 billion of total net inflows during the first quarter, the highest quarter of net inflows in a year. Net inflows were driven by strong inflows in cash and good inflows in the institutional business, as clients turned to State Street's offerings in a time of turmoil. After experiencing net outflows in January and February, I would note that March was a particularly strong month for our ETF business, with our SPDR suite of ETF gathering more than $20 billion in net inflows. Aided by the integration of Charles River Development, we continue to see that our front-to-back Alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients and building on this remains a key focus for us in 2020. We signed a large sovereign wealth fund as a front-to-back client in quarter one. The front-to-back State Street Alpha pipeline is developing and advancing well with a good mix of deal sizes, functionality and scope. Turning to expenses, first quarter total expenses were down 1% relative to the year ago period, excluding notable items. We are building on the strong culture of expense management we successfully established during 2019, when we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency, and reduce expenses through a comprehensive firm-wide expense savings program. Today, we are more focused than ever on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits, as we strengthen our operating model, even during this unprecedented period. In addition, as a result of the current environment and our decision to suspend workforce reductions, we are taking additional expense actions, including a hiring freeze for non-critical operational positions. We also continue to very carefully manage all discretionary expenses. To conclude, while we cannot predict the scope and duration of the pandemic and the associated economic impact, we will remain very, focused on three core priorities. First, supporting our employees and our communities, second, providing service and operational excellence to our clients, and third, driving value for our shareholders. While the markets may be unpredictable, we are well prepared to navigate this volatility with a strong balance sheet, capital position and proven operational capabilities. We at State Street remain outward looking, globally connected and laser-focused on helping our clients achieve better investment outcomes for the people they serve. State Street has navigated through good times and bad times for our clients for over two centuries and this moment will be no different. We stand ready to support our clients and our global workforce in any capacity we can. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Alex, let me start on that, and then I'll turn it over to Eric. We remain very pleased with the impact that CRD is having on our business. The front-to-back pipeline continues to grow, and it's having CRD as part of that toolbox, if you will. And as I've mentioned before, in some cases, we don't end up, in the end with a full front to back, but we end up with a built-out relationship or even a relationship that we didn't have before. For example, the one front-to-back win that we had this quarter -- that we announced this quarter. It was not even an existing client of either CRD or State Street. So, from an overall enhanced State Street value proposition that's working well. As Eric noted, the reported revenues are very, very sensitive to the accounting rules and the accounting treatment. And we did -- it's very sensitive to when we're delivering things and if delivery gets changed or if the contours of something gets changed, it does affect the timing of reported revenue. So, strategically, this remains a very important and integral business for us. It's driving a lot of new activity. It's driving activity into the profitable back office for us. So, we remain unchanged, and it's important to us strategically. And Eric can talk about the actual financial impact that you're -- in your question? Brandon, that's a really good question and a real hard one to answer with any conviction. But let me share with you how we're thinking about it from a forecasting standpoint and then some of the possibilities. From a forecasting standpoint, our view is, by May and June, absent any other dramatic changes to the environment, the FX volumes will normalize back to what they were pre-crisis. And then that those levels, pre-crisis, will be what we should expect in third quarter and fourth quarter. Now, I'm saying all that, assuming that we have stability in equity markets, bond markets, global markets, and that's hard to predict. And, obviously, any further deterioration of the health situation or the economic situation is going to push us right back to where we were. So, -- and we're not hoping for that, we're hoping just for the opposite for the quieting of the enormous disruption that we've seen. All that said, there is a range of outcomes here, not just from the pandemic and its economic impact on markets like we saw in March. If we have a repeat of that in the coming months, and we could see some higher volumes again. But there's also a set of, if you think about the rest of the year, set of events, right? We've got Brexit continuing in some ways. We've got U.S. elections. We've done a series of different elements, I think, political, economic, global, world trade is going to come back at some point, and we'll have -- we may have tensions there. And so it's hard for me to really predict. And so, we tend to try to be careful with our forecast in FX, in particular, knowing that there certainly could be some upside. But I think we'll all see it when it happens and can probably factor that in. Yes, Ken, the -- I mean, the level of engagement remains high and has continued to be high, even during this last month, five weeks of -- with almost everybody in the world working from home. And in fact, a new very large situation developed right in the middle of all this that we've started to work through. I would say that the underlying themes remain the same with this idea of improving and lowering costs of the asset managers or the asset owners. Cost structure of improving their operations, trying to do an outsource of things that are not really critical to their investment, but critical to achieving better outcomes, both for their clients and for themselves. I think what's changed and what's been added to the consideration now is all of the operational stress that's been applied to these managers since then. Many, many managers were not prepared for work from home, and they certainly weren't prepared for a global work from home. So, we see that, if anything, providing another catalyst to these kinds of, what we consider, fundamental enterprise outsourcing. And you can see that it's playing through even in our new business. The line that we focus on is new business, plus business to be installed. And as you can see, the business to the installed number remains quite high. And that reflects the fact that the business, increasingly is less about just a single product and much more about multiple initiatives, multiple kinds of offerings that we have underway for our clients. And we think -- see this continuing. We see this -- the need and desire to outsource at the extreme. You'll have clients that just have antiquated systems or operations that need fundamental upgrading. At the other extreme and we've experienced this, too highly successful managers and asset owners that are saying, we can do this, but it's not a good use of our time, and we want to be able to scale and we want to work with a partner that could be there for us. So, we see this whole trend continuing and probably accelerating. Yes, Ken. We should be clear. We make our own decisions on this. We are part of the forum. We talked forum and we considered it actually a very good move to make to instill confidence in the system and to -- remember this happened at a time where people were questioning whether or not banks would be there. And we -- I felt it was not going to be useful for us to not be part of this and to have more time spent on, why are the one or two outliers as opposed to the banks are committed to being there during the crisis. But we make our own decisions. You're right. We are very different, and our results will play out differently than credit intensive banks. So, the good news is that with the new rules that are being implemented, capital planning can be much more dynamic than it has been in the past. And we'll take advantage of that as the situation plays out. I mean, the realities are that it's still highly uncertain. You heard that -- and the environment is highly uncertain. You heard that reflected in the assumptions upon which we based our guidance to you. One could argue that we've been very conservative, but one could argue also that the situation could get a lot worse than what our -- what we put out there as a point estimate. That's exactly what we've done. We've given a point estimate within a wide range of potential outcomes. The market level one is the biggest one. And there the assumption is, is that average markets will be what they were at period end March. I mean, that's -- we're already much -- the spot levels are higher than that. So, we really don't know here, which is why going back to your question on capital, if this all plays out as we see, we believe we'll be in a position to distribute capital, but we think it's wise to be able to make that decision dynamically quarter-to-quarter. Good morning, Betsy. What I would add to Eric's comments or a couple. We have had underway, as you would know, a lot of work on process redesign and automation, and that work is not stopping, right? How we -- how and when we realize the benefits of it may change and be delayed, but the work is not stopping. And so -- and if anything, we're redoubling our efforts there. So, I would just note that we've got this moratorium, and we absolutely think it's the right thing to do. But our work, both in IT and operations, and then how we connect with our clients that remains -- we're working full speed on that. The other point I'd make on the leases is that I agree with your point that we probably won't be as dense for a long period of time, at least until there's a vaccine. But I think it's surprised everybody, not just at State Street, but elsewhere, how effective one can be in work from home. And I would have to believe that over the medium and long-term, that you'll see us having less space than we do today. We are. And that was always a natural financial benefit to us. So that's still underway for the end of 2022. Brian, let me take those two different, but related questions. On Charles River, we're still quite confident in the revenue and expense synergies. The expense ones are something we do as a matter of course. And you can imagine, we'll actually try to accelerate those a bit, but those are on track. And then on the revenue side, a good bit of those synergies are actually coming from some of our trading businesses as we plug-in our FX and securities lending and other markets activities into Charles River, and that's on schedule and moving along at pace. So, we're currently confident in our delivering on the synergies for Charles River. On the servicing side, as I mentioned, the client on-boarding has stayed on track in March and April and so as we think about the time line of that $1.1 trillion to be installed for the servicing business, we think that will play out during the year. If you recall, I've talked about those wins and some of those wins are fast to install, say something like custody. And others, where it's a mix of custody and accounting and, perhaps, some of the offshore cross-border products, those tend to take longer. When you add middle office, it takes even longer. And -- but those are all part of the standard course of business. And we don't, at this point, see a slowdown in the implementation on onboarding rates. And so far, our clients are eager to move forward. Because in some ways, remember that business that we won came with some fee adjustments. Clients are -- want to conclude on those and so they need to implement the service. And so those are now because they're paired up, I think we'll stay on track on both sides. Yes, let me begin on that. I think that as Eric noted, we stand by the 2021 synergies that we laid out there. And I think what's happening here is that, the pipeline that Charles River would have seen versus the pipeline that it's seeing now is quite different. It tends to be larger, more complicated and sophisticated clients. It tends to be part of a multiproduct installation. So, what you're seeing is it's just taking longer to install and therefore for the part of the deal that gets credited to Charles River, it's just taking longer for that to happen. And in fact, you're seeing now in the current installations, two very large installations underway, one of which has been out there since before we acquired the firm and that's changed over time, and that's delayed the revenue recognition. So, over the long-term -- over the medium and long-term, do we believe that this business can grow faster under us than it was prior to us? Yes, we do. Yes. We -- market share is a hard thing to measure in this business because nobody uses just 1 provider. But we have invested heavily over the past couple of years in this era of low volatility to build market share to show and demonstrate the clients, the capabilities that we have, and that really helped when it came time. And the team came through and the transactions occurred really difficult roles, period end roles that were going to be hard to execute, got done, and clients remember that. So, we think this market share that we've built will last for us. As Eric noted, what we saw was just immense volatility, an immense kind of move from risk-on to risk-off assets, including moves out of certain base currencies to others and all crisis driven. So if we see that again, then there's lots of bad news elsewhere. Will we likely see -- or could we likely see is maybe a better way to describe it, volumes higher than what we've seen in the 2018-2019 timeframe? Possibly, right? Because I think we'll be in an era of -- I mean, almost any forecast, one would have to believe has some level of heightened risk. The other thing too is, I mean, we saw our giant rotation out, particularly of emerging markets. I mean, at some point, there'll be a rotation back, and that tends to be also beneficial to us too. So, again, we gave you an estimate and we tried to be conservative here, recognizing the range of -- or the amount of uncertainty and therefore the range of possible assumptions. But there certainly is a case where one could expect to see not sustained levels, at least in our forecast that we saw in Q1, but levels above what we've seen in the prior four to eight quarters. Well, it's -- Mike, it can't be one or the other. But I would say that, particularly since we feel like over the last year, year-and-a-half, we've gotten a very good handle on our expenses, not just from an expense level, but how we manage those expense levels, how we manage the productivity. I think you will find that our tone and our actions are mostly around offense. Certainly, as it relates to clients, we have had unparalleled levels of client communication and client engagement. And if anything, the time in working from a home cause people to redouble and re-triple their efforts to be there to support clients. And that will pay off for years to come. So, we think that, in the short-term, we have to be protecting our employees, both their -- physically and mentally. And we think we've taken the appropriate actions there, but we don't think we've taken them at the expense of any kind of long-term opportunity creation for ourselves and our shareholders. Yes. Well, my reference to emerging markets, I mean, that rotation was happening, and just if anything has played itself out even further over the last month. I don't believe that, that's makes sense over -- certainly, it doesn't make sense over the long-term. It won't make sense over the medium term. And we would expect to see as the situation -- as the situation stabilizes and investors start looking at relative valuations around the world, they'll see the -- just the value opportunities in emerging markets. So, I wasn't suggesting even a greater rotation, rotations largely happen. The question is when will the rotation back occur? Yes. Well, certainly, in the short-term, that's what they're doing, right? I mean, it's -- you're seeing a giant push into cash, but at the levels that investors are getting paid and the amount of stimulus, first, monetary and increasingly fiscal that's going to be put in. Again, one person's opinion. I think that the more likely long-term trend is for risk assets, particularly equities to continue to provide superior returns. And in a period of uncertainty like this, which is not only uncertain, but previously unknown, you're not going to see as much in the short-term until there is more certainty. But all of the ingredients are in place, low -- lots of monetary stimulus, lots of cash in the system, low interest rates, to see a return to risk on at the appropriate time. Yes. So -- and probably China, our Hangzhou operation is a great example of what we can expect worldwide. We started -- we were given the go-ahead to start returning employees there back in the middle of March. And we're now back up to about 75% -- between 75% and 80% back to work. And we've actually metered that. We -- as we've noted earlier, we have not densified the office as much. We've put -- we've got testing facilities on the way in. Initially, people were wearing mask. And now you're seeing a much more normal working environment. And I think that will stay for as long as there's not another outbreak. What we're seeing elsewhere, in Asia is, not quite as fast to return to work. But -- but you're also seeing guidelines kind of ebb and flow, as you see periodic outbreaks. And I think that's probably what we're going to live with around the world. I don't think this will be a straight-line recovery, in terms of whether it's back to work or back to gatherings. I think that there will be periodic outbreaks. Businesses and governments will need to respond to those. They're not going to respond in the same way, if the lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong or anything they'll be very targeted guidelines. For example, in Singapore, they just recently limited restaurants, again, but they didn't send everybody home from work. So, I think that's what you can expect to see, if you will, a steady recovery back over time. But with some lumpiness along the way as there are outbreaks, until we get to a -- until we get first to testing, and then to widespread availability of vaccines. 3,000 in China, the vast majority of them, 2,800, in our Hangzhou facility. Why don't I begin--? Why don't I start, Eric? In terms of -- I'll start with your second question -- on the second part of your question, Eric will answer the first. We have spent a lot of time with our clients. Remember, we've got a fairly concentrated book of business. Our 100 largest clients constitute a big portion of the total. And we're through 80-plus percent of that, we've gotten term out of a lot of them. But more importantly, we've just learned how to do this better than we have in the past. So, while, for sure, our clients will be under their own sets of stress as a result of this, we are not anticipating a heightened level of price compression. Part of it is that it's a given -- if you think about the way that we're remunerated in a client relationship, a part of that is NII and they can see as well as we can that that is -- that the source of return is going away. So, we think it's reasonable to assume that the pricing, as we've said before, will -- pricing pressure is abating, that it will continue to abate and level out at a normal level, which is -- it's not going to go away, but it will be a normal level as opposed to what it's been over the past couple of years and nothing that we've seen this year so just anything different on that. Good morning. Thank you, operator, and thanks to all on the call. Thanks for joining us."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. To start my review of our first quarter results, I'd like to go to slide five, where you can see, we reported EPS of $1.62, up 37% year-over-year. On the top left panel, I would call your attention to two items. First, our FX trading business had extraordinary quarter, generating revenues of $459 million of record volumes and increased client demand, which I'll spend more time discussing shortly. And second, we had a $36 million provision expense with a sequential increase driven largely by the effects of the COVID-19, on our economic forecast. On the top right panel, we had $11 million of expected pretax acquisition and restructuring charges, primarily related to Charles River as well as $9 million of after-tax costs associated with the redemption of our Series C preferred securities.  On the bottom left panel, we show our quarterly results, ex-notable items for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. I would also note that we were able to generate positive operating leverage in the first quarter, helping to improve our first quarter 2020 pretax margin year-over-year. Turning to slide six, period end, AUC/A levels decreased 2% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter. Year-over-year, AUC/A were affected by a previously announced client transition that had a deminimis effect on year-on-year revenues. Quarter-on-quarter, the AUC/A decrease were mainly due to lower end-of-period equity market levels. As a reminder, approximately half of our AUC/A is reported on a one month lag, so some of the impact of the equity sell off seen in March has not yet reflected the year. AUM levels decreased 4% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter to $2.7 trillion, driven largely by lower end-of-period market levels, partially offset by strong net inflows over both time periods. Amidst the extraordinary market conditions for asset managers in the first quarter, State Street global advisers saw net inflows of $39 billion, largely driven by cash and institutional inflows. Unpacking the first quarter, AUM trends a bit, it was a tale of January and February versus March as after seeing modest net outflows in the first two months of the quarter, Global Advisors saw strong inflows of approximately $45 billion in March with $27 billion in cash inflows and $23 billion in ETFs. Global Advisors saw strong inflows of more than $10 billion in March alone into SPY, our premier S&P 500 ETF offering, and the largest and most liquid product in its class. Moving to slide seven, servicing fees were up 3% year-on-year as the core business continued to regain momentum and down 1% quarter-on-quarter on lower equity markets. As Ron said, the investment services business saw significantly elevated client activity inflows during the quarter, particularly in March and successfully navigated the activity with minimal service disruptions. Through this stressed environment, we believe clients realize, perhaps more than ever the value of our scale and capabilities during exceptionally challenging market conditions. By way of an example, a number of our asset manager clients have expressed gratitude for their partnership with State Street and the fact that our investment servicing business has worked tirelessly to ensure that their fund investors are able to buy, sell, and monitor their fund performance, both accurately and timely, which gives them the strong sense of confidence they deserve. On the bottom right panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators that underlying this dynamic. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $131 billion in the first quarter with several deals coming through the pipeline in late March. We do expect to see some near-term slowdown in sales, but assets to be installed as of the first quarter period end is strong at $1.1 trillion, and we still expect fee pressure to remain moderated as it has in recent quarters. Turning to slide eight, let me discuss the other fee revenue lines. Beginning with management fees, first quarter revenues were up 7% year-on-year, but down 3% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower average market levels and mix changes away from higher fee institutional products, partially offset by positive mix changes in ETFs. As I mentioned earlier, FX trading services were up 64% year-on-year and 68% quarter-on-quarter as the business saw record volumes and increased client demand given market volatility amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, something I'll be discussing more -- in more detail shortly. Securities Finance revenues were down 22% year-on-year as investor asset mix shifted towards lower spread fixed income assets and as hedge fund deleveraging in foreign markets drove down the enhanced custody demand. Revenues were down 17% quarter-on-quarter due to similar factors. Finally, software and processing fees were down 41% year-on-year and 49% quarter-on-quarter. As you know, this line includes certain business revenues such as CRD software fees, as well as other lumpy items, such as the amortization of tax advantaged investments, certain currency translation impacts, and the mark-to-market adjustment on the employee long-term incentive plans. These other items are worth about $65 million negative this quarter as opposed to the usual slight positive. Moving to slide nine, we wanted to provide some incremental color around the extraordinary quarter we saw on the FX trading franchise. For several quarters now, we've been highlighting that our FX business had been confronting historically low volatility levels, but that we have been focused on expanding the client base and building share of wallet, while reinvesting in our broad set of platforms. This quarter, we are thus, well-positioned to support our clients' needs as volumes and volatilely level surged to the COVID-19 pandemic, spurring elevated client demand across our various FX trading venues. As you can see, the FX sales and trading business, including direct FX and custody FX, saw a 40% increase in volumes from average levels, while our FX trading platforms, including FX Connect and Currenex saw a 50% increase in volumes over the same period. On the right-hand side of this page, we've included the most recent Euromoney Rankings related to the FX business, including its number one ranking for real money asset managers for two years in a row to give you a sense of the depth and breadth of this important franchise. Moving to slide 10, you'll see in the top left panel a five quarter summary of CRD's stand-alone revenue and pretax income. For first quarter, CRD generated standalone revenue of $100 million, which was up 1% year-on-year and down 21% quarter-on-quarter. I would again remind this audience the lumpiness inherent in ASC 606 revenue recognition standards and to not read across any one quarter's results. Having said that, we do expect some disruption and updates in professional services fees over the coming months as on-site activity is currently somewhat curtailed. On the right panel, we've again included some texture around the momentum we're seeing in the business and how the integration is progressing. We continue to remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition. Turning to slide 11, NII was down 1% year-on-year, but up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential increase in NII was primarily driven by increased deposit balances and episodic market-related benefits of approximately $20 million, partially offset by long-term debt issuance costs. Average assets were up as average deposits increased 10% quarter-on-quarter from fourth quarter 2019, with period end deposits increasing 41% quarter-on-quarter as we saw a wave of flight-to-quality client deposits surge at the end of March, particularly from asset managers. We were there to support our clients. We've since seen deposit levels receipt somewhat in April, but they still remain elevated versus 4Q 2019 levels. End-of-period assets were also driven off by $27 billion as we help clients access the Fed's new money market mutual fund liquidity facility or MMLF. State Street facilitated just over 50% of the MMLF volume as we asserted our leadership role in supporting our clients and the smooth functioning of markets. Moving to slide 12, we've included some color here on the loan portfolio as well as the company's allowance for credit losses. As you know, State Street's loan portfolio is relatively small, typically 10% or so of average assets and generally consist of high-quality and conservatively underwritten mix of fund finance, leveraged loans, commercial real estate and municipal loans. On the right panel of this page, we've included some incremental detail around the loan book and its characteristics. In the current environment, I'd note a few highlights as of first quarter. Approximately 91% of the book is investment grade with 84% of the on-balance sheet exposure to investment-grade and 98% of the off-balance sheet exposures. The leverage loan portfolio of approximately $4 billion has relatively low exposure to cyclical factors currently in focus and has an average rating of BB, which is stronger than the traditional index. Compared to 4Q 2019, average loans grew 12%, while period-end loans grew 23%, primarily driven by elevated client overdrafts as we help clients facilitate the higher settlement of trades and FX activities during March. These overdrafts have already receded in April. Moving to the bottom left panel, the total allowance for credit losses increased by $35 million to $124 million as we added to reserves, largely related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the end of March economic forecast. On slide 13, we've again provided a view of expenses this quarter, ex-notables, so that the underlying trends are really visible. Our first quarter 2020 expenses excluding notable items and seasonal expenses were down 2% year-over-year, driven by resource discipline and reengineering efforts and down 2% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by the timing of foundation funding, lower travel and lower professional expenses. We continue to execute on many of the investments and optimization savings initiatives detailed earlier in the year and believe that taken together these various efforts position us to navigate the extraordinary market conditions seen in recent weeks and meet our expense goals. We're making good progress in lowering compensation and benefits costs, occupancy costs and other costs and IT costs are lumpy but on track too. Given the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenue, we obviously need to begin to intervene further on expenses and now expect to take them down 1% to 2% for the full year. This won't be easy, but we've begun to accelerate our plans and we'll adjust as we know more. First, as Ron mentioned earlier, for the remainder of the year unless the crisis concludes earlier, we will suspend most workforce reductions. We also instituted a hiring freeze for non-critical positions. Second, we see opportunities to dig deeper in non-compensation expenses, such as occupancy, contractors, travel and other professional fees. Third, we will be judicious about the reinvestments needed to drive growth in our business. And finally, we will adjust as the situation develops. Moving to slide 14, you can see that we maintained strong capital and liquidity levels during the first quarter with our standardized CET1 ratio, which was binding for first quarter ending at 10.7% and our LCR ratio essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. As you can see in the middle right panel, our SLR and Tier 1 leverage ratios ended at 5.4% and 6.1% respectively, with the sequential decline largely driven by an influx of flight-to-quality client deposits. We have the room to support our client activity under both ratios, especially given that the SLR would have been 7.1% post-implementation of Section 402 on April 1. During the quarter, we returned a total of approximately $683 million of capital to shareholders, including $500 million in share repurchases before we acting in coordination with other sub members of the Financial Services Forum agreed to temporarily suspend our repurchases in second quarter. We remain confident in our robust capital levels and our ongoing ability to continue to deploy our balance sheet to support our clients, the financial markets and the broader economy. Turning to slide 15 now, we've provided a summary of our first quarter results. As we mentioned earlier, throughout this crisis, we have been differentiating ourselves by proactively reaching out and assisting clients for these difficult times. Our resiliency during heightened volatility and our ability to execute record volumes without sacrificing service quality has created goodwill with our clients as we look to the future in the post COVID-19 time period. That said the potential length and depth of impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy has made the operating environment uncertain. This uncertainty, obviously, introduces a higher than usual degree of variability into our financial outlook. However, I would like to share our current expectations for the remainder of 2020 under a certain set of assumptions. While we believe these are reasonable set of assumptions, there is a broad range of possibilities regarding the potential length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the scale the economic impacts. As such, the current expectations we are providing today will represent one potential range of outcomes, but they are not representative of the full range of potential outcomes that may actually occur. So, with a very difficult second quarter economic situation in front of us, we assume global central banks keep short-term rates low and that long end rates then flowed up to about 80 basis points by year-end. We assume equity levels in second quarter to be consistent with March averages and potentially float up in the second half of the year. This will leave average equity market levels for 2020 lower as compared to 2019. Given these significant changes to the economic outlook, we currently expect that fee revenue will be down 1% to 2% year-on-year for full year 2020. Looking at the component pieces of our fee revenue; let me go through each one. Beginning with servicing fees, we expect they will be down 1% to 3%, driven largely by lower-than-expected market averages. We continue to see good underlying health and momentum in the servicing business, although there may be a slight slowdown in the sales pipeline over the near-term as clients adjust the new operating environment. Moving to management fees, we would expect now that they will be down 3% to 5% year-on-year, depending on equity market performance. I included in this outlook, the zero interest rate environment introduces the likelihood of money market fund fee waivers, which are highly sensitive to short-term rates and could have a modest impact of approximately $10 million to $40 million on our business, largely in the second half of the year. Our markets businesses will continue to be informed by the trading environment. We expect the spike in FX trading revenues will subside with market volumes and volatility, while securities finance will continue to be impacted by lower levels of leverage. Within software and processing fees, we remain confident in the CRD deal synergies. However, the uncertainty and the operational pressures introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic on the front office clients is now expecting to create go-live delays and slow down professional services projects of several current CRD clients. As a result, we now expect CRD revenue to be up mid-single-digit percentages year-on-year for full year 2020. At this time, we would expect software and processing fees ex-CRD, to likely be between $60 million and $70 million per quarter for the rest of the year, absent any further significant market-related adjustments. Regarding the second quarter of 2020, on a sequential quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be down 5% to 9% depending on our much lower equity market levels. The servicing fees towards the minus 5% end of the range, management fees coming in towards the minus 9% end of the range and considering some reversion in the trading revenues. Regarding NII, we still expect to be down approximately 10% year-on-year for full year 2020, as I previously indicated in mid-March, primarily driven by the impact of lower rates and the relatively strong performance in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we currently expect NII to be down about 11% quarter-on-quarter ex-episodic items, driven by the full quarter impact of lower rates. We expect NII to stabilize by the fourth quarter. Turning to expenses, even during this unprecedented period, we remain laser-focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and automation benefits. We expect that full year expenses, ex-notable items, will now be down 1% to 2%, exceeding our original goal of down 1%, as I mentioned earlier. In regards to our provision expense, 2Q results will be driven by updated economic forecast embedded in our new CECL models, plus any specific reserves. At the end of March, we assumed a number of factors in a range of scenarios for our general reserve. Among those numerous inputs, our dominant scenario had 2Q GDP of minus 12% and full year GDP of minus 2%. Had we moved to a different dominant scenario where full year GDP was minus 6%, for example, than we would have roughly built an additional $50 million of reserves. I'm simplifying, of course, and there are dozens of important variables, but this example gives you a taste of the sensitivity of the CECL reserving process to potential economic scenarios. On taxes, we continue to expect that we will land within the previously provided range of 17% to 19% for a tax rate for the full year, though some discrete items are expected to drive down that rate by about four percentage points lower for second quarter. And finally, we've again included our previously disclosed medium-term financial targets in our earnings presentation this morning because we believe they are the right targets. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of its impacts, raises the question regarding the timing of when we might realize those targets, which were set on a run rate basis for 2022. We are not changing the timing at this point, but we'll continue to monitor the length of the COVID-19 anticipated impact closely going forward. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Alex, its Eric. Let me start on the deposits and just give you a little bit of texture on the trends, because I think that, that would help you. And obviously, the deposit levels move quite a bit. If you recall, back in fourth quarter, our deposit levels were about $165 billion in aggregate. And in January and February, they were literally just spot on to those averages. What started to change was the surge we saw at the beginning of March. And so, if we just think about the first half of March, we're running at about $185 billion of average total deposits. The second half of March spiked to $235 billion, and that together is what got us to a -- drove the higher averages for the quarter. And I think you saw our end-of-period print was north of $250 billion. And we literally operated at that level of deposits for about a week at the very end of the quarter. In terms of today, they've been running somewhere around $200 billion, $210 billion, so still hefty and I'll call kind of risk off levels. We're seeing that flight in [[h] quality and we're certainly there to support our clients. We do expect them to ebb down. And I think the question is, what's the pace of that? Do we get a resurgence or not? But there's a range of scenarios. What I would say is that the deposits now are a facilitation, a way for us to facilitate the needs of our clients, right? We're there for them on overdrafts, we're there for them on deposits, we're there for them on repo, we're there for them on supporting them at the Fed facilities, and I think we're delighted to do that as much as possible. In terms of the capacity, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we've got ample capacity at these levels of deposits to support our clients. You see our capital ratios, whether it's the SLR, post the April 1 change is quite high. And that can -- that's at -- on a reported -- on the new basis were about 7% against the 5% level. You see Tier 1 leverage. We still ran well this quarter, and that's against a 4% minimum. So, there's certainly some range. There's not unlimited range, but our perspective is that, if deposits stay in the asset levels that they are at today, the kind of $200 billion to $210 billion that's quite comfortable for us and we're here to do what we need to for our clients. Sure. Alex, its Eric. So the quarterly revenues are always lumpy, and I'll just remind you that for a midsized client will bring in when it's on an on-premise basis, potentially $5 million, $10 million in a potential installation when it goes live. The smaller clients obviously, are $1 million, $2 million, $3 million. And so you can see, on a base of $100 million, you've got -- we could see big swings in growth rates, positive or negative. So I wouldn't read too much into that. What we have done is started to think through the likely revenues for the business this year. And this business in contrast to our servicing fee business, has more on-site kind of work that needs to be done. If there's on-site sort of co-development to integrate our platform within asset managers, there's professional services billings that also go with that. So, between the professional services billings just being slowed down with work from home, and then the go-live dates likely to be pushed out. I don't think there'll be -- we don't expect them to not be there, but we do expect some lengthening of those go-live dates. We're now looking at revenue growth at about 5%, 6%. We said mid-single-digits as opposed to the low-double-digits that we had expected this year. And we think that's mostly going to be around timing as opposed to underlying performance. The pipeline in CRD specifically is healthy. It's continued at the levels that it had been just a few months ago. And the interest in securing mandates from our clients, we think, it's actually as strong as ever. Glenn, its Eric. I think you've got the right frame of mind on the loan book, so a modest-sized loan book which is 10% of our total assets. And it's pretty diversified both across categories and then within categories. So, fund finance, as you mentioned, is primarily capital call finance loans with recourse to some of the largest in premier investors in the world, where -- that's a pretty attractive business area for us and one that's grown nicely. Leverage loans is an area that we -- obviously, in this environment, we'll spend a little extra time and I'll come back and talk about that in a moment and then commercial real estate overdraft munis are pretty straightforward. You are right to hypothesize that more than a majority of the reserves for our book is for the leverage loan book. And the reason we're reasonably comfortable with this book, do not have to say that things won't happen on an individual name here or there, is that it tends to be an upmarket book. Average rating is about BB as opposed to the average in the index is single B. And it's -- literally, the center of gravity is quite different. We've been tracking the market prices for this book. This book tends to have market prices as we've seen some change in the market to be six, seven points better than the typical -- than the average leverage loan index. So, it's performed well so far. And it's pretty well diversified. There aren't any particularly unusual exposures. There's not much oil and gas in it. So, we're -- we think it'll operate well during this time period. But I guess at the end of the day, it's a relatively high-grade version of leverage lending, and it's only $4 billion. And so we think it's -- it'll perform well and will just be a piece of the broader picture for the company. Glenn, its Eric. I think you said it right. I won't repeat the five-letter word you use. But prevailing interest rates at the Central Bank, if you think of IOER as a benchmark are remarkably low, right? They're at 10 basis points. So, if you think about it, whether we taken a deposit at zero or taking a deposit at one, there's very little spread there. And so the value of the deposits, while they're there for -- they're there on our balance sheet, and we can lend against them, we can use them to support our other books, they're transient, by and large. And the value is small relative to what it's been. If you think back to the first quarter, on average, first quarter deposits were worth roughly 100 basis points. Just think about the cost of funds versus the IOER rate. In the second quarter, we expect deposits across the spectrum to be worth a fraction that closer to 10 basis points. So, it's just in an order of magnitude difference. And so, while we'll have -- we may have a surge or higher levels of deposits, we'll not be particularly renumerative this time around. Yes, Brennan, it's Eric. Let me give you a little bit of texture perhaps on what's included in the $13 billion of fund finance, and how we think about it. And you can imagine, over the last month, between finance and our risk organization and our business teams, we spent extra time. And heightening our oversight and monitoring. But let me describe for you what we have there, and kind of how we think about the -- each of those books and maintaining the quality that we like. So, within fund finance, the largest piece is capital call financing. That's literally lines to some of the premier investors around the world, and that's done on a -- that's been allocated on a fund-by-fund basis. But the work that was goes on behind the scenes is that, each of those funds as a set of investors behind it. And what we need to do is maintain a diversified group of leads to those investors. And we want to avoid all concentration. So, there's a lot of work that gets done as we grow that book to make sure that there aren't any unknown concentrations or the concentrations are all within limits, on a literally an investor-by-investor basis, because that's where we have recourse. So, that's the primary approach on the capital call financing. The next piece within fund finance is the 40 Act liquidity funds that -- these are the funds that can have a certain amount of leverage. They're very well described, I think, in the 40 Act rules and they have limits on the amount of leverage they can. And there, the monitoring is what the asset pool? It's effectively a version of margin lending. What's the underlying asset pool? What are the line sizes? How do we constrain those appropriately and have our limit structures? And then there is literally the daily monitoring of that leverage in that margining. So, that's pretty straightforward in some sense. But, just like you say, you never say, never. And so, there's extra oversight in these volatile times to measure and to monitor the underlying collateral literally on a daily basis, as you'd expect. And then the smallest piece within fund finance is the BDCs. It's just over $1 billion. It tends to be BDCs with BBB pools of underlying loans. And so there, it's about diversification of the BDCs. They tend to be from some of the most premier alternative asset manager providers, right? Some of our largest clients because that's who we're trying to support there. And there, it's about a set of size limits and ongoing monitoring. So, that's maybe a little bit of texture. I think like I guess the frame of reference I'd give you is each of these a little different, and each of these have a different level of monitoring. And the process now, I think, like any bank, but ours is kind of simpler and more vanilla than most banks is to see if there're any -- if margin changes more than expected, occasionally you get questions around the possibility of adjusting covenants, and that's -- that quickly escalates. So that we have to make sure that how we react to those proactively and consciously. And sometimes we grant those and sometimes we grant those and actually ask the borrower to reduce their leverage or their -- or our exposure to -- our exposure to them. And so there's a -- I'd say there's a very natural set of actions that we use, both on a monitoring and intervention basis on an ongoing basis. But let me pause there with at least that texture. I'd just add that we're also -- obviously, these -- the revenues this year are based on the of bookings and the wins from last year by and large, I think about the installation process. And so far, I think we've been pleased with the continued implementation. Our onboarding team has been active through the end of March on-boarding some sizable clients on schedule. April, we've -- we're halfway through April and have visibility of the rest of the month and are not seeing any unusual or major delays. And so for the time being and I think if we could get through March and April, the -- that will bode well. But the previously one business tends to be installed on schedule because it needs to be, right? You've got the previous provider who needs to come off. You've got a lot of preparation that's been done. And so, so far, we've actually seen good progress or good continuity on the onboarding side, which is important because that's when the revenues tend to begin to be accrued. Ken its Eric. Yes, that's for the rest of the year, primarily in the second quarter. I gave you a large range, because it's also highly dependent on short rates, right? If the overnight repo rates are one or two basis points or six or seven or 10 or 11, you literally -- you could go from zero to the -- to what could be the upper end of that range. But that would have been for the rest of the year, and it would be primarily in the second half. Yes. Yes. Betsy its Eric. The opportunity set is broad and it's a set of initiatives that we had underway. And in the spirit of -- when things are tougher, you've got to act more dramatically, is I think the theme that I share with you. So, if you think about the different areas of our expense base, the compensation benefits line won't be as much of a tailwind as we've, I think, made a very conscious and appropriate choice on protecting our people. But if you think about the expense base, that's only about half of the expense base. And even within the compensation benefits line, for example, there are contractors, there's significant amount of contractors that we employ. And if you think about it, if we're going to end up with a larger employee workforce than we expected, right? Contractors could be an area that we -- where we adjust. So, it's that kind of action. Occupancy is another natural one, whoever thought that you could run a company at a 80% or 90% work from home, but it does give us a real perspective as we have lease rollovers or where we might have been planning on taking additional leases, and there's always a role instead of either potential exits or ads that you're doing as you load balance. You can imagine, we've got lease ads on a complete moratorium. And where we had rollovers, you can imagine, we're now starting to move in the opposite direction and say, hey, why can't I let this space go? And when employees do come back, I want all my employees back, but we clearly have more flexibility than we ever would. So, that's another example. Third one might be around all the other expenses in technology, there's software, there's hardware purchases, et cetera. While our teams are spending time on supporting clients and literally hourly daily basis, it's also a natural time for us to slow some of our purposes of capital equipment or software, doesn't say we won't come back and naturally think about outspending some of that in the future, but it does mean that we can slow some of those purchases because it's -- we've shifted some of our time and energy to more immediate situation as opposed to some of the medium term investments. So, I think that's the other one, which is the -- kind of the reinvestment. We'll naturally slow to some extent. And if you remember the chart we did at the fourth quarter earnings call in January, we showed expenses down 1%. Now, we're saying down 1% to 2%. But within that, there was 3% or 4% increase in investments of expenses due to investments and 4% to 5% decrease going in the other direction. And so part of what we're doing is also, I think, being more disciplined about those reinvestments that we're doing now and pacing them. Sure. Let me -- Brian, let me take those in order. So on the average balance sheet, you're right. The non-U.S. deposit costs fell, they were minus four basis points or minus 20 basis points. It's literally the effect of the FX swaps, which are diagrammed out in the footnote on that page. I think it's page seven of the financial addendum. And as well as some modest reductions in interest rates in foreign jurisdictions, right? Some of the European and Asian central banks drop rates, and so that will flow through that line as well. In terms of the NII that we reported in first quarter, we did note that there was about $20 million of higher-than-usual NII separate from the deposits. The deposits for welcome and additive NII. But away from deposits and loans and investments, the $20 million was really split into two. About half of that was literally the hedging effect that goes through. We hedge either debt or the rate coupons on some of the loans, and that creates a mark-to-market as you've got changes in the debt market. So it's worth about half of the $20 million. And the other half was actually some good positioning that we took in the quarter with the influx of deposits and in particular dollar deposits, we were dollar rich. Dollars were quite valuable. And so we -- the treasury team did quite well to invest those in either yen or euros. They're kind of one and two-day overnight basis swaps and that was renumerative to us. And at the same time, it was helpful to either clients or counterparties in those foreign jurisdictions who were $1 poor and needed some of the access to the dollars that we could provide. So those were the two components of the $20 million. Finally, on the deposits, what I did say to one of the earlier questions is the value of deposits has changed significantly in P&L terms. I mean, the value of deposits always high on a balance sheet basis and not that we needed more deposits. But we were happy to accept them from our clients. The point that I made is that the level of deposits in the first quarter and then last year were a big -- had a large impact to NII, because the kind of typical deposit. Let me kind of use that in very broad swap might have been worth 100 basis points, think about the cost we would have paid on average for the deposits, saying in the U.S., versus the IOER rate at the Fed. That would be kind of a simple approximation. If you fast forward in, say, in April or in second quarter, how valuable is that same mix of U.S. deposits? It's much less. It's closer to 10 basis points. And why is that? It's because our cost of funds -- the cost of those deposits to us could be zero or one basis points or two or three. But we reinvest them at IOER rates of 10 basis points. And so what we effectively had is a very large change in the value of incremental deposits between kind of the pre the Fed moves and then post Fed move. So, that was the point I was making. So the profit will matter a little bit to NII in the -- going forward, but not nearly as much as they would have mattered in the past. Brian, it's Eric. The end-of-period balance sheet is a good starting point for -- to follow-up on that question. And here's how I'd frame it. I think the MMLF balance is, we're at about $27 billion at the end of the reporting period on March 31. And they've been in that range, I mean, plus/minus a few billion dollars has we've been in that range for the first two weeks of April. And then deposits, which had spiked to just over $250 billion or probably closer to $200 billion to $210 billion.  So it's really the deposit -- the reduction in deposits that are adjusting the balance sheet down by call it, $50 billion end of period relative to what we saw. There will be a few other smaller movements. Overdrafts have continued to float back down to more traditional levels, the mark on the forwards and the FX books have started to revert. So, there's a few billion here or there and a couple of other areas, but the biggest one is the guidance, I gave on deposits coming down by about $50 billion from the end-of-period levels, will be the biggest change so far that we see. Steven, its Eric. There are a number of factors that you've got to assemble to really predict the path of NII. And in our 10-K, we tend to assemble them all together. And the securities portfolio is just one of them. If you think about the average duration of our balance sheet, you are right. The securities portfolio has an average duration of 2.6, 2.7 years. But the rest of the asset side of the balance sheet is actually much more floating rate. And remember, the securities portfolio is ex the MMLF to keep it simple is call it, just shy of $100 billion out of a $250 billion typical balance sheet. So it's an important piece, but it's not the only piece. The effect of that is that the average duration of the asset side of the balance sheet that we have is about 1.3 years, so about half of the duration of the securities portfolio. And it's that -- and that shorter net asset or the lower duration of the total asset side of the balance sheet is what creates a re-pricing that tends to be a little faster than you would have expected by just thinking about the investment portfolio. So, as we've played that through our models and, obviously, in our models, there are a lot of different factors, but those two are important ones. You see a step down from first quarter to second quarter that's significant. I gave an indication of that. We see another step down, but not as large in percentage terms from second quarter to third quarter. And then starting in the fourth quarter, you see a fair amount of stability between fourth quarter and then our guesstimates of what we might see in the first and second quarter of 2021. And part of that is that you've got the interest rate effects playing out. Then you've got some natural balance sheet growth, which creates a bit of a tailwind. And so once we get through the bulk of the interest rate effect, which happens in the first couple of quarters, the headwinds and the tailwinds tend to roughly even out, which is why we think we'll see some stability from the fourth quarter onwards. Yes, the -- I'm trying to think about a good way to describe that to you. So, our investment portfolio yield right now is about just over 2%. And that will -- that's been -- that floated down just marginally, but that's because rates fell quickly towards the very end of the quarter. If I think about reinvestment levels in the portfolio, I guess we could talk about new investments, what's rolling off. There's a lot of ins and outs of that. Maybe the better way to describe it is that the average yield on the portfolio is about 2% on average for first quarter. If we start to think about what's the average yield in second quarter and maybe in the third and fourth quarter, we're closer to about 1.5% kind of roughly if I eyeball what the averages will look like. And that will be driven by the new roles being added and the old roles coming off. But that's probably a good rough amount, a good rough estimate for you. Steve its Eric. So, a couple of perspectives there some of which you touched on and others, which I'll add. I think first, we added to a reserve about $35 million. So, the reserve was up about one-third. And I think when I scanned across peers, you saw reserve increases of anywhere between 30% and 50% on corporate books. So, I think we're -- we made the right upward adjustment just given what we do at the time and what our forecasts were as of March 31. In terms of comparing the reserves to say, the CCAR losses, either the Fed model or our own models or to loans, I think that's where the mix of the loan book is in -- at all those ratios is incredibly sensitive to the mix of the loan book. If you think about it, our fund finance loans and one could go back to the last crisis, the 2008 crisis, performed particularly well. And so we've got to factor that into our reserving. And what I would say is that the reason the fed both does its math on estimated losses under CCAR and then asks us to do our math, is not just to say, hey, there will be a natural bid ask, but it is to reflect the different nature of the books. If you think about it, I think the Fed spent an enormous amount of time as you would expect on what is the typical mid-market corporate lending book going to result in, in terms of losses? Or what's the typical credit card book that it's -- and how will it perform under stress? I would think that, while they have extensive modelers, they probably spent a little less time on our fund finance to capital call line book just because it's small and it's not widespread around the industry. So, I would at least say that in our particular circumstances, the company run stress tests that you've been referencing are in our mind is a good indicator of credit under stress and May. But I'll be sensitive to it because all models are informative, maybe a bit more indicative than some of the Fed models just because they tend to be much more averaged across more kind of a non-custodial set of banks. Hey, Bob, it's- Yes. Rob, it's Eric. I'd just add that pricing has been a natural part of this custody business for decades. And what we're doing in the disclosure on the slide deck is literally given you for servicing fees, what's the very transparent roll forward and net new business flows and client activity, which were up this quarter actually was a tailwind, market appreciation and depreciation and then pricing going the other way. So, it's just part of our natural disclosure now and on a going-forward basis. But as Ron said, we expected a certain amount of pricing to come through during this year at that kind of 3% level, so down from the 4% headwinds we saw last year. And we're -- everything we're seeing suggests that we're on track for that currently and it will be -- it will moderate from last year's levels, so in line with what we currently expect. Gerard its Eric. I think the answer is an easy yes to both of those. So we tend to be a participant in a set of syndicates with the other large banks and work closely with them. We'll occasionally, but we tend to be a participant at the table. And we tend to operate within syndicates of sister banks that we feel when they lead are very thoughtful about credit and credit appetite because it's not just a particular loan, but it's the covenants, it's the terms and conditions that matter. And so the choice we make of which syndicates to join, and which lead banks to partner up with is important. So -- but that tends to be our position to participate. And then absolutely, we participate in the SNC reviews and SNC tests. And so that's a way for us to, I think, for the industry and for our supervisors to make sure that we evaluate credit consistently. I think what's helpful about leverage loans is they're also traded in the marketplace. So, there's an external market benchmark, and that's -- they are external ratings. And oftentimes there are prices, but there's also the SNC review process. We participate in that. And so we feel like we've got a very good read into the quality and health and -- of our book. And as I mentioned, it tends to be double the average book with actually some BBBs and higher and just very few under the BB level. Sure. Gerard, let me give you a little bit of texture because if you think about our client base, it's asset managers, asset owners, alternative providers, insurance, a wide breadth. I think what we -- what we saw is that while they all tended to become more liquid and go to cash, and so we had some increase in deposits from across all those segments, the single largest area came from our asset managers. And sometimes, it was the asset managers who were running money funds and they were derisking those funds and then leaving the deposits with us. And sometimes it was just the asset managers running various funds that we custody for equity funds, bond funds, U.S., international, et cetera, where they were derisking within those funds and shifting to cash. And so those are probably the two different factors within asset management -- asset manager complexes. And it's that cash that's come back and sits on our balance sheet. And so I think part of what we're watching for is how quickly does that cash get reinvested versus how liquid do those managers want to stay, whether it's the kind of money market complexes they run? And so sometimes they stay in cash as opposed to even buying short and medium-term treasuries. Or how risk off some of the long players or even the alternative providers want to be. But those are the factors, and it was primarily around asset managers. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're delighted to make our balance sheet available to them, both on the -- as they have these flight to quality deposits or even operationally as we support them with overdrafts, because that's -- both of those are important parts of our business. In addition, even to some of the off-balance sheet activity, the sponsored repo and other facilitation that we provided, let's get another source of liquidity as well."

Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRonald O’Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the dedication and strong performance of State Street employees during the past year. These team members remain central to the continued successful execution of our strategy as we help to create better outcomes for the world’s investors. Together, we accomplished a great deal in 2021, including higher fee and total revenue generation, successful execution against both sales effectiveness and client retention goals that is driving growth and business momentum, as well as announcing the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services. All of this would not have been possible without our employees’ hard work, skill and commitment. Slide 3 of our presentation highlights the progress we made during 2021, with both of our business segments performing strongly as we advance towards achieving our medium-term financial targets. Within the Investment Servicing business, we enhanced – our enhanced core strategy, combined with our strategic pivot to an enterprise outsourced solutions provider across the front, middle and back office, manifested itself in stronger business momentum and revenue growth in 2021, which you can see along the top of the slide. As we successfully diversify and broaden our wins by region and client segments, we achieved record AUC/A servicing wins of $3.5 trillion in 2021 and continued to deploy our enterprise outsourcing capabilities underpinned by our integrated front to back Alpha platform. We announced nine additional Alpha wins in 2021, with 10 Alpha clients now live at year-end. We also continue to enhance our product capabilities in 2021, launching Alpha for private markets as well as our new State Street Digital division. At Global Advisors, we executed well against our long-term strategy, which contributed to a number of records for that business in 2021, including revenues, assets under management and ETF inflows. Importantly, Global Advisors full year pre-tax margin expanded by over 6 percentage points in 2021 to a record 32%, deepening the value of our investment management franchise to State Street’s results. Our SPDR business performed particularly well in 2021, gaining U.S. ETF flow market share, including low-cost and active in addition to the record inflows I just mentioned. As I look back at 2021, I am particularly pleased with our client impact, improvement in our sales effectiveness and heightened focus on client satisfaction, service quality and retention across our businesses, together with a favorable equity market backdrop, helps to drive a stronger revenue performance. Notably, full year servicing and management fees each reach our highest level on record in 2021, with total fee revenue increasing by 5% year-on-year and exceeding $10 billion for the first time. While we delivered a strong revenue performance in 2021, expense management remained a key focus for us, with company-wide productivity and engineering efforts achieving approximately $330 million of gross expense savings. Because of our strong revenue and sales performance in 2021 and the healthy pipeline in front of us, these efficiency savings allowed us to fund investments in our talent, technology and business in the fourth quarter to drive future growth. Even with this increase in investment, total expenses will contain relative to revenue growth, helping to drive a significant improvement in a number of key financial metrics that you can see on the bottom of the slide. Despite record low interest rates and excluding notable items, we delivered meaningful full year pre-tax margin expansion, positive fee and total operating leverage and EPS growth in 2021, and we expect to do this again in 2022. Turning to Slide 4, I will briefly touch on our fourth quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. 4Q 2021 EPS increased 28% year-over-year, or 18%, excluding notable items. The strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by solid total fee revenue growth, which more than offset interest rate headwinds on NII, leading to a good fourth quarter total revenue performance. We delivered 130 basis points of total positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter, excluding notable items. Importantly, we again expanded State Street’s pre-tax margin, which increased by more than a percentage point relative to the year-ago period to 28% in the fourth quarter, excluding notable items. The solid business momentum that we saw during 2021 continued into the fourth quarter, which you can see in the middle of the slide. AUC/A increased to a record $43.7 trillion at quarter-end and new asset servicing wins amounted to $332 billion for the quarter. AUC/A won, but yet to be installed, was $2.8 trillion at quarter-end, while Charles Rivers’ annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter increased 9% year-over-year to $244 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $4.1 trillion at quarter-end, management fees increased to a record $530 million in the fourth quarter, benefiting from higher year-on-year average equity market levels and record inflows to our ETF franchise. Turning to our balance sheet at the bottom of the slide. Capital return remains a key part of our medium-term targets and we recognize its importance to our shareholders. As you know, we suspended common share repurchases in Q3 in connection with our intended purchase of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services. We currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of this year, in line with our previous expectations. To conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased with the strategic operational and financial progress we demonstrated in 2021. We meaningfully improved our full year financial performance across a number of key metrics, creating value for our shareholders and advancing us towards our medium-term financial targets. Looking ahead, I have four core strategic objectives for 2022, which are aimed at helping us achieve our vision for the organization and position the business for future success. First is to continue to grow revenue by executing on a number of key strategic priorities this year, including completion of our pivot to an enterprise outsourcer underpinned by our Alpha platform build out; continuing to develop key product offerings and capabilities, particularly private markets; and further strengthening sales and client management capabilities and processes. Second, the successful integration of BBH Investor Services is a key priority. The proposed acquisition is a financially compelling use of capital. And once closed, it will strengthen our market leadership by creating the world’s largest custodian, expand and deepen our international reach, further propel our Alpha strategy and add strong talent that will supplement our focus on client and service excellence and expertise. Third, as we did in 2021, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization. We are developing and implementing a simplified, scalable, configurable end-to-end operating model. This more scalable model will allow us to deliver increased client quality, operational capacity, speed and resilience. Fourth, we must continue to build an even higher performing organization. A performance culture and improved employee experience will enable us to sustain a more diverse, engaged and empowered team with the experience, capabilities and desired behaviors required for further – for future growth. These four goals reflect our relentless focus on performance and achieving our medium-term financial targets. I have confidence that we’ll be able to meet our strategic and client goals, while also delivering positive fee and total operating leverage and expanding our pre-tax margin each year through our medium-term horizon, aided by the strong momentum we are seeing across our businesses. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognize in the quarter outlined on Slide 5. First, we recognize acquisition restructuring costs, most of which were related to CRD and whose integration is now complete. Second, we recognize the net repositioning release of $3 million, which consists of occupancy costs of $29 million as we continue to reduce our footprint and a release of previously accrued compensation costs were $32 million, as attrition picked up and we redeployed staff more effectively than anticipated. Third, we saw an opportunity to correct an imbalance in the competitiveness of our compensation program by accelerating expenses associated with certain deferred cash incentive awards. The impact of the acceleration increased expenses by $147 million in this quarter. This change will allow us to realign the mix of immediate versus deferred cash in our incentive compensation awards in future periods, which will make our pay practices competitive and enable us to better attract talent in an increasingly tight talent market. Our mix of deferred equity remains unchanged. Finally, you’ll see that in the fourth quarter also benefited from a $58 million gain on sale legacy LIBOR base securities previously classified as held to maturity. This sale and this quarters’ higher than usual tax benefits help to offset some of the deferred compensation expense acceleration I just mentioned. Turning to Slide 6, I’ll begin my review of both fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. As you can see on the top left of the slide, we finished the fourth quarter with strong revenue growth compared to 4Q 2020. 4Q 2021 fee revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting strong growth in servicing fees, management fees and CRD revenues, only partially offset by lower FX trading services. 4Q expenses were well managed, delivering positive total operating leverage notwithstanding the significant 2021 NII headwind. 4Q pre-tax margin is up more than 1 percentage point year-on-year and ROE is up almost 2 percentage points. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2021 revenue performance. As Ron highlighted earlier, 2021 was a record year for us for fee revenues. And despite historically low interest rates in 2021, I’m quite pleased that for the full year, we still delivered positive operating leverage of more than a percentage point improvement in pre-tax margin and EPS growth in the double digits. Turning to Slide 7, you’ll see our Investment Services balanced growth remain strong as we saw record AUC/A the end of the fourth quarter of $43.7 a year-on-year increase of 13%, largely driven by higher market levels, client flows and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A growth was muted as markets were pretty mixed. At Global Advisors, AUM at year-end increased 19% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter to a record $4.1 trillion. The year-on-year in sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher market levels, coupled with net inflows. Of note, we reported strong net inflows during the fourth quarter of almost $80 billion. Our global SPDR ETF business recorded the highest ever quarter, driven by strong U.S. flows, pushing total net ETF inflows to $107 billion for the full year. Turning to Slide 8, you can see another quarter of good business momentum. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased 6% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels, client activity inflows and positive net new business again. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about a full point of currency translation. On a sequential basis, I would remind you that while the S&P was up on average, international markets were down, so markets were relatively neutral. Servicing fees were down 1%, primarily due to client activity and adjustments and the impact and appreciating U.S. dollar, partially offset by another quarter of positive net new business. AUC/A wins totaled a solid $332 billion in the fourth quarter, which gets us to a record $3.5 trillion new wins across client segments and regions for the full year and our pipeline remains strong. At quarter-end, AUC/A won, but yet to be installed, amounted to $2.8 trillion, without representing a nice proportion, which reflects a unique value proposition and our competitive strengths as the only front to back offering from a single provider. Turning to Slide 9, fourth quarter management fees reached a record $530 million, up 8% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in an investment management pre-tax margin of 34% for fourth quarter. The year-on-year management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF inflows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by previously reported client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers of $20 million in the quarter. The quarter-on-quarter results were largely driven by a slight uptick in equity market daily averages. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by both strong quarterly momentum and full year results. We were particularly pleased that the actions that we’ve previously taken over the years in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises delivered growth over the course of 2021. Regarding management fee money market waivers, we currently expect that they will come in at approximately $5 million less in the first quarter of 2022 based on an anticipated March Fed rate hike, which will be included in our 2022 outlook. Turning to Slide 10, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. FX trading services was down 7% year-on-year, reflecting lower FX volatility and lower volumes in our standing instruction business. On a sequential basis, FX revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by higher FX volatility, partially offset by lower volumes. Moving to securities finance. Fourth quarter fees increased 16% year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher clients securities loan balances and new business wins and enhanced custody. On a sequential basis, fees were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances. Finally, fourth quarter software and processing fees were down 4% year-on-year and 2% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by lower market-related adjustments, partially offset by continued growth in CRD, which I’ll turn to next. Moving to Slide 11, I’d like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong standalone CRD results in the quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 13%. Full year standalone revenue growth was a 11% year-on-year year, which makes this the second year in a row where we grew the business revenue in the double-digit range. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continue to grow nicely as we onboarded and converted more clients to the cloud. SaaS clients now represent nearly half of our CRD client base. In addition, we achieved record new bookings of $62 million for full year 2021, with a healthy revenue backlog of $117 million at quarter-end, demonstrating the continued business momentum as we head into 2022 supported by the Alpha – by the State Street Alpha value proposition. Turning to Alpha on the bottom right of this slide. Full year 2021 was a busy year, as we announced nine new Alpha mandates and nearly doubled the amount of wins we’ve achieved since inception. At year-end, we have 10 total live Alpha clients. We’ve also been busy enhancing our Alpha product offering this year. In addition to launching Alpha for private markets and our acquisition of Mercatus in the third quarter, we also went live with our Alpha data platform in the fourth quarter, which is our cloud native platform providing enterprise data management and access to all the data and analytics that our clients use to perform their daily end-to-end investment processes. Turning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII was down 3% year-on-year, mainly driven by the impact of a low 2021 interest rates on the investment portfolio yields, partially offset by another quarter of higher loan balances, as well as growth in deposits and the investment portfolio. Relative to the third quarter, 4Q NII came in 1% lower, primarily as a result of the expected normalization of premium memorization. As you may recall, third quarter 2021 included an episodic benefit worth about $7 million, which we previously noted wasn’t expected to repeat in fourth quarter. We do, however, see continued premium amortization slowing. We, like many of you, are excited about the rise we’ve seen in long-end rates this year. However, short rates have been flat so far and it’s really the prospect of Fed action in the March timeframe, which would have a significant benefit on NII. On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Average assets increased 4% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by higher deposit levels. We consciously allowed average deposits to float up this past quarter, which we then expect to monetize in a period of rising interest rates. Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were up 1% year-on-year as we previously decided to increase incentive compensation to reflect strong year-on-year performance and pulled forward some investments in the business. At the end of the year, however, we also experienced some higher than expected episodic expenses. Medical costs were higher as we saw ramp-up in year-end claims, we saw some elevated IT vendor costs and we realized higher marketing spend associated with GA volumes. Compared to 4Q 2020, on a line item basis excluding notable items, compensation and employee benefits was up 2%, driven by higher incentive compensation medical costs, partially offset by lower headcount and salaries. Notably, our continued focus on digitization, automation, as well as resource discipline has helped us reduce our headcount this year by 2 percentage points, even as we onboarded larger deals and process more transaction volume. Information systems and communications were up 11% due to continued investment in our technology infrastructure and resiliency, as well as the equipment expenses as we move more activities to the cloud. Transaction processing was down 7%, primarily driven by lower market data and brokerage costs. Occupancy was down 6%, reflecting the benefits from eliminating another 5,000 seats, and achieving 115% occupancy rate, and other expenses were down too. Overall, we’re pleased this year with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline. Excluding the impact of currency translation with approximately 1 percentage point, full year 2021 expenses would have been flat. And in a year where fee revenue growth grew by mid single digits, we meaningfully expanded our pre-tax margin and generated positive total and fee operating leverage despite a challenging interest rate environment. Moving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels, whether without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements. As of quarter-end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 14.2% increased 0.7 percentage points quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting an outsized reduction of about $5 billion in RWA related to the impact of FX mark-to-markets and higher retained earnings. We expect our RWAs to increase in the first quarter to more normalized business levels and the effects of expected regulatory changes coming in 2022, all of which has been previously considered in our capital guidance. Our Tier 1 leverage decreased slightly quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by higher client deposits, and lastly returned a total of $209 million to shareholders in the form of fourth quarter dividends. As previously communicated, we expect our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges for the first half of 2022, inclusive of the implementation of SACCR and the expected closing of the Brown Brothers Investment – Investor Services acquisition. Turning to Slide 15. You can see a summary of our 4Q 2021 and full year 2021 results. I’ve already covered fourth quarter in detail. So let me say a few words about our full year results before jumping into our outlook for 2022. In summary, we’re pleased with our strong performance this year. Notwithstanding the challenging industry environment, we delivered a 5% increase in total fee revenue for the year with servicing and management fees reaching our highest levels on record. Our expenses for the full year remained well controlled, and despite higher revenue-related costs and investments in our business and people. As a result, even in last year’s low rate environment, we delivered positive operating leverage and we’re able to drive pre-tax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced medium-term targets. And with that, I’ll turn to outlook. On Slide 16, let me cover our full year 2022 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which do not yet include the previously announced acquisition of the Brown Brothers Investor Services. We continue to target a closing by the end of the first quarter, although the timing could fall in the second quarter. We are in the process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals, some of which have already been secured. The process is proceeding at a slower pace than anticipated with many regulators around the world addressing the high volume of global M&A activity. That said, given the current higher equity markets step off and new interest rate forwards, we now expect about 25% year-on-year year EBIT growth for the acquired business for each quarter in the first year post closing instead of just 15% year-on-year EBIT growth in our original acquisition deal modeling. Now, as I usually do, let me first share some assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, our rate outlook largely aligns the current forward curve and assumes we see three U.S. rate hikes in 2022 with the first hike occurring in March. We are also assuming around 5 percentage point to point growth for equity markets in 2022, as well as further normalized FX market volatility, which influences our trading businesses. As for currency translation, we expect the U.S. dollar will be stronger for the year, which will be a headwind to revenues, but mostly offset as a benefit to expenses. So beginning with revenue. For the full year, we currently expect that fee revenue will be up 3% to 4%, with servicing fees growing 2% to 3%, both include about a point of currency translation headwind for 2022. Regarding the first quarter of 2022, we expect fee revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year, given equity market expectations and continue business momentum, with servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and management fees expected to be up 8% to 9%. For full year NII, depending on the timing of the projected rate hikes, we expect 2022 NII to be up 10% to 12% on a year-on-year basis. Regarding first quarter of 2022, we expect NII to be up 3% to 4% year-over-year and still flattish sequentially. Now turning to expenses. As you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex-notables will be up just 1.5% to 2% on a nominal basis in 2022, as we continue to invest in the business and our people, while driving both positive total and fee operating leverage. We currently assume that this includes a 1 percentage point benefit to expenses due to this stronger U.S. dollar. You can also see on the walk that for full year 2022, we expect another year of growth saves of approximately 3 to 4 percentage points, which will help fund variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like Alpha, digital, tech infrastructure and automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2022, we expect year-on-year expense growth to be largely in line with the full year guide, and includes the seasonal compensation expenses, which occur in the first quarter. All in all, our plan is to invest behind the revenues and deliver both positive total and positive fee operating leverage. Finally, we estimate our effective tax rate to be in the 17% to 19% range for 2022. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRonald O’Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning, guys. Happy New Year to both of you. So maybe we can start unpacking some of the guidance and I’m sure there’s going to be a good amount of follow-ups on the back of that as well. But maybe just starting with the fee guide, really zoning in on service and fees. State Street has obviously made a considerable amount of improvement in retaining clients and winning a business. So maybe help us unpack within the 2% to 3% growth for the year. What sort of contemplated from markets in terms of the benefit of the 5% that you guys highlighted earlier? So how much is the market benefit versus net new business and pricing? And I’m assuming BlackRock is included in this guidance as well. But how much of a drag in this service and fee revenue you guys expect from loss of the BlackRock mandate?\nEric Aboaf: Alex, it’s Eric. Happy New Year to you, too. Let me cover fees and then servicing fees, which I think is where your focus. Our guide for total fee revenue is up 3% to 4% for the year, our guide for servicing fees up 2% to 3%. And obviously, that includes about a percentage point of headwind from foreign exchange. So in effect, the servicing fees are up, for example, 3% to 4% in our guide, adjusted for currency translation. If you think about the drivers, we’ve factored in all the known events, both our growth, our installations, net new business and so forth. If you want to peel it apart a little more deeply, we start off at a good equity market level and we expect some year-on-year growth from equity markets, that’s probably worth about 2 percentage points of a tailwind to growth. Flows and client activity, which – variable is probably worth another percentage point and part of our kind of fee structures. Net new business is – continues to tick up. We expect core net new business to be up 2%. And that obviously includes all the new onboarding, offset by any attrition. So that’s on a net basis. And then obviously, there’s just the usual, 2%, grind down of pricing. And that kind of gets you to the low end of our range. We think there’s some upside, which is why adjusted for currency, the servicing fee guide is in the 3% to 4% range. And what it does is, it represents the continued acceleration of our business towards our medium-term targets, which are really in the 4% to 5% range.\nAlexander Blostein: Great, that’s perfect. And just maybe staying on the topic, but looking at the expense side of the P&L, the 1.5% to 2% growth, I think, is contemplated on obviously the fee outlook that you’ve just outlined. If we are in a tougher equity market backdrop, and let’s say, you guys don’t hit the 2% to 3% servicing fee growth, or the 3% to 4% fee growth. What is sort of the bookends around the expense growth trajectory that that will continue this year? So in other words, like in flat equity markets, should we expect you to be below the guide on expenses, given there’s maybe more flexibility or kind of the range is the range and the revenue will be more kind of working independently?\nEric Aboaf: Alex, that’s a fair question. And you can see that part of the way we create some, I’ll call it insulation for ourselves as we think about equity markets and where they might go, whether it’s up a lot of modestly flat or down, is that we’ve designed our plans with a view that we should and intend to deliver a couple points of operating leverage, and actually a couple points of fee operating leverage, right? That that couple of points gives us some flexibility to handle some variability in the – in what happens in actuality in equity markets. I think, certainly will move within our range based on what we see. Obviously, if we see a market – an equity market correction of down 5%, or down 10%, we’ll do everything we can to come in below our range. And certainly, we can flex in this business, a full point can be flexed. It’s not easy, but it can be flexed. And that would be the approach that that we take. But we’re confident with kind of the level of equity markets they are today. Part of this – part of what we see is fairly – a fairly nominal uptick in equity markets. So we think there’s a good kind of middle of the fairway plan, but we’ll certainly flex it, we, to the extent that we can.\nAlexander Blostein: That’s great. Thanks very much for the color.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJames Mitchell: Hey, good morning. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the BBH. I appreciate the discussion around the increase in EBIT from rates, how much is that? Can you speak to their off-balance sheet sweep, deposits, maybe update us on the level of that? And how you think those act at a rising rate environment in terms of the sweep fees is pretty similar to the spread on deposits?\nEric Aboaf: Jim, it’s Eric. The business that Brown Brothers has run on the investment services side is performing well. So what we’ve seen is, with the higher equity markets, we’ve seen their servicing fees come in a bit stronger for this coming year. I think that deposits both on-balance sheet and the swept ones are within the range of what we’ve seen. And I think we describe those as bit under $10 billion on-balance sheet and a bit over $65 billion swept and they’re coming in right around that range. And that’s our expectation for 2022. The – both the on and off-balance sheet do have a good translation into higher revenues as rates move up. And the on-balance sheet betas are similar to ours. And we’ve – we had very nice betas in the early part of the last rate cycle and expect to have that again on ours and on there. And then the off-balance suites also have betas. They’re not quite as strong as deposits, but they’re in the range actually and that also will provide some very nice, I think, fee growth as we take on that business.\nJames Mitchell: Okay, great. And then maybe just pivoting to the asset management business, you had record flows, strongest flows in many years. Can you just describe where the biggest drivers of that growth are coming from? What you’re doing to enhance that growth? And is this more just the environment’s grade? Or do you think there’s some sustainability to that inflow?\nRonald O’Hanley: Jim, it’s Ron. Let me take that. I think that the growth is reasonably broad-based in the sense that it’s, firstly from our investments – an ongoing investments in the ETF business. So you saw lots of strength in the core SPDR offerings, which are really instruments of choice for the – for large institutional investors and good growth in areas where we invested active ETFs, fixed income, the low-cost ETFs or non-U.S. So we expect to continue to see a good performance there, particularly as we’ve worked to solidify our position with institutional investors. Secondly, in the institutional – in the traditional institutional space, the team’s done a lot of work in developing products that are companions to the core index business. We have a great client roster, and we’ve seen some diversification in the – in that business. Then finally, we’ve got a great cash business. And obviously, it ebbs and flows as cash does itself, but will also benefit a little bit from rising rate environments as is the remainder of the fee waivers goes away. So it’s really across the board.\nJames Mitchell: Okay, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. So first, Eric, I just wanted to unpack some of the NII – the assumptions underpinning some of the NII guidance. I was hoping you could just share some insights in terms of what you’re contemplating as the Fed initiates QT in terms of just deposit flight broadly, or deposit runoff, and maybe deposit remixing kind of non-interest bearing deposits. And just in terms of spot rates, where you’re reinvesting today versus the bank book yields?\nEric Aboaf: Steve, it’s Eric. Let me do that in reverse order. I think the front book and the back book are starting to converge in the investment portfolio. And you’ll see that our investment portfolio yields took a – another small tick downward this quarter in fourth quarter. But starting in first quarter, we’ll see that relatively flat and then you’ll see a slow progression upward. So we’re comfortable with where we are in terms of long rates. And obviously, the higher the loan rates come in, the better off, we’ll be. The NI uptick for this year and then let me get to the question around balances and quantitative tightening, I think, is just comfortably dependent on the Fed increases. I think we’re showing 10% to 12% expectations in NII, low more than half of that is off of rising short-term U.S. rates, about a little less than a quarter is off rising non-U.S. short-term rates, and then the last portion is off of the rise in long rates. So, we’re really geared towards the front end rates, and then that flows through directly to balances. For deposit balances, we currently expect U.S. and international deposit balances to be flattish, I’d say this this year. And I think we’re all wrestling with what’s the pace of the Fed’s actions in terms of rising interest rates. When does that start? And then when did they start with the – with some amount of quantitative tightening? And I think it’s just helpful to book in this. There has been a lot of discussion about quantitative tightening over the last week or two. Certainly, it will happen. If you go back to the last cycle, which was just three, four years ago, so not a long time away, quantitative tightening started two years after the first rate rise, and a full year after the second and third and fourth, kind of that steeper part of the rate rising cycle. And so, I think quantitative tightening, though, there’ll be a bid ask range on this. This is something to expect in 2023, more than 2022. And we’ll thereby and then have some effect on deposits. How much, it’s hard to tell. As you know, this cycle, we’ve controlled some of the uptick in deposits. We had pushed them off in third quarter, as you recall, let them back in this quarter. We’ll certainly see some deposits ebb downwards in 2023 and 2024, perhaps, or potentially just say flattish. Because the question is the pace of the quantitative tightening. And if you recall, last time around, just, I guess, three, four years ago, I think the Fed felt like it tightened too much, right, and created some disruptions in the short-term money markets. And so while we expect some tightening to happen in, say, a year-and-a-half from now, or thereabouts, we’ll see. The – I think the pace of the tightening maybe more moderate. But anyway, we’ll see. We’ll see. That’s, call it, 2023 topic. I think, 2022 should be fairly straight.\nSteven Chubak: Oh, thanks for that context, Eric. And just for a follow-up on how you’re thinking about capital management. You spoke about reinitiating the buyback beginning in 2Q. I was hoping you can give us some context as to like what level of payout you’re planning as we look ahead to 2022 to 2023. And just in terms of future changes to the capital regime, any guidance you can provide on the impact of SACCR or and preliminary thoughts on the impact of upcoming changes under Basel IV regime would be really helpful.\nRonald O’Hanley: Sure. There’s a lot there, Steve, in your question. So let me take it kind of from the near end timeframe to further out. We’ve – I think we’re pretty comfortable with our capital guidance that will be at the low end of our 10% to 11% range for CET1 in the first quarter. That includes both the SACCR being implemented and the consummation of the Brown Brothers acquisition. So, that I think will carry us through at the low end of our range for the first half of this year. And we – we’re, I think comfortable with both of those. As we go through the year in the second quarter, we’d certainly like to start the buyback. We’ll see at what pace the pace of a buyback start will depend on the kind of the exact capital ratios as we hit first quarter and then second quarter. We’ll see how OCI swings either positively or negatively. And so I think that then sets us up to start buying back stock in second quarter and then proceeding at pace in the third quarter, fourth quarter and beyond. And then I think at that point, we’re back to trying to, or we’re not trying, but operating within our guidance, that capital return should be in the 80%-plus of earnings. And that puts us, I think, in a way that we continue to return through dividends and buybacks capital in a nice, comfortable way. So, anyway, a nice path forward. But first half of this year, I think, low end of our ranges, and then the second quarter, and then third quarter, fourth quarter, we start to reinstate and then accelerate in buybacks to a comfortable level. The Basel III refinements, Basel IV end game, there are different ways, different vocabulary out there, certainly come to pass. Clearly, we’ll get some benefits on the loan book that we have a smaller loan book than others, though, we’ll probably get some headwinds from the funnel and to review the trading book, and then some headwinds from the ops risk capital charges. So my guess is it’ll be a bit of a headwind. But like I said before, it’s been all factored into our capital ratio guidance. We generate quite a bit of capital each year. And we feel comfortable that we can continue to deliver on our medium-term targets of returning 80% or more of earnings back to shareholders.\nSteven Chubak: That’s great a color. And just quickly, can you – did quantify the impact from SACCR just so we could start to reflect that in our models?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. I didn’t in the prepared remarks. But the rough amount, we carry typically about $115 billion of RWAs, it was a little less this quarter. SACCR is – will cost us in the first quarter, just over $10 billion. And we’ve got offsetting actions worth about half of that – about half. So call it around $5 billion. So I think net basis, it’s probably worth about $5 of RWA. But as I said before in my prepared remarks, this has all been factored in to our capitol guidance that we gave back over the last several quarters, and we’re confirming and affirming that we’ll be within our ranges in the first half of the year.\nSteven Chubak: Understood, Eric. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Eric. Good morning, Ron.\nRonald O’Hanley: Hey, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Eric, can you give us some for the color on, you gave us good detail on the servicing fee growth, and how you expect to see that 3% to 4% grow this year with some new inflows, as you pointed out, but also from some equity improvement in the markets. I think you said about 2 percentage points of that number. When you take the – when you look at the equity portion, how important is the U.S. markets versus and EMEA and the other markets? Can you kind of give us a flavor, is it generally geared toward the U.S. markets that drives your growth?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, it’s Eric. It’s really a mix, I think, maybe almost if I just think about the ranges, it’s a bit under half, that’s thrown by U.S. markets closer to probably, I don’t know, a 30ish European markets and then Australian emerging markets just because of the, in some cases, the higher fee rates is also important, that could be worth 20%, 25%. The other, as you remember, we have part of our book is fixed income assets that we service. And so, that’s why equity market tailwinds effect part of our book, but not all of our book in rising rates, we’ve thought the opposite effect in – on the fixed income side. What I – just as we from a planning purposes as we go into the year, though, on a point-to-point basis or if we were to stay flat from now through the end of the year versus the average of last year of 2021, that in and of itself should give us at least point and a half of servicing fee lifts. And then what we’re talking about is whether the point-to-point growth from December 31 to – 2022 December 31, can give us that extra half a point. So, I think that’s how you get the roughly 2 percentage point tailwind that we expect, somebody has in a way baked in assuming markets don’t go down. And then a smaller piece is coming from some modest appreciation.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, you discussed it at your peers about the expectation of rising interest rates – short-term rates, Fed fund rates in 2022. Can you share with us the duration of the fixed income portfolio? And what rates should we watch carefully that would impact the AOCI, meaning, the mark-to-market would be negative for the portfolio?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. We – the duration of the investment portfolio, we inch down this quarter, you could have seen that in the NII slide that we had, I think, we’re at about 2.9 years. So, trended down a bit from the last quarters – last couple of quarters. And right now, we’re a little more comfortable. We’ve been investing in the belly of the curve, kind of a two to five-year range. I think the 10-year up through 2 percentage points is quite comfortable for us, including from an OCI management standpoint. I think if you get good bit of buffs, 2 percentage points on the 10-year, you kind of have a – you got a double effect. On one hand, you get an OCI ahead, which obviously creeps back over time. So it’s temporary. And the other hand, you celebrate higher rates flowing through the investment portfolios over the coming quarters. So, I think it’s mix, but net positive if we have some sort of spike at the back end. But it would affect just the mechanics of how we operate quarter-to-quarter on the margin.\nGerard Cassidy: I appreciate that. Thank you, Eric.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Gerard.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.\nRob Wildhack: Good morning, guys. You had another good quarter of loan growth here with average loans up 7.5% sequentially. What were the drivers there? And how sustainable do you think that is into 2022?\nEric Aboaf: Rob, it’s Eric. Loan growth has been good for us the last, say, couple of years, to be honest. I think we’ve comfortably driven loan growth quarter after quarter, up in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, we continue to see good client demand, but we also shifted some – we also added some CLOs in loan form, as we reduced the CLOs and securities form from the investment portfolio. So, there was a bit of a shift. That said, I think, in general, what we’re comfortable doing is continue to grow poor loans, because that’s – we won’t always have a shift every quarter, this is more episodic, just as we rebalance and think about stress testing and how to operate efficiently with our multiple constraints. But we’re still comfortable, continue to grow this loan portfolio in the low double-digit range, it won’t happen every quarter. There’s a little bit of seasonality, but we continue to see quite strong demand from our alternatives clients and private equity capital call financing. We see demand in some parts of the alternative and real estate markets that we play in. And the biggest focus I’d say is as we lend more and deploy capital to our clients, a lot of what we do is work with them and make sure that’s part of a broader relationship because that’s where it really is renew motive for us and for them and helps us grow the – helps us build the reputation and the momentum to build the fee line as well.\nRob Wildhack: Got it. Thank you. And then turning to expenses and operating leverage, the outlook implies maybe a 2 percentage point delta between fee growth and expense growth, but it also bakes in plus 5% or 6% from investments and variable costs. Do you think of that is still an elevated level of investment? And there’s some more operating leverage available longer-term? Or is this kind of the required level of investment going forward?\nEric Aboaf: It’s hard to forecast the future. The amount of investments is partly around what’s table stakes in the marketplace and partly around where do we see opportunities to differentiate our offerings. And clearly, you’ve seen us invest in particular in Alpha, in the front office and Alpha that spans into the middle and back office. And we’re also finding opportunities in the back office to invest through sort of feature functionality enhancements and custody in some areas of accounting, which also is attractive in segment by segment. So it’s hard for me to say, what’s the necessary amount of investments, we think there’s a range. We think last year, we probably invested a bit less than this, probably, instead of 5% to 6%, I’d say, there was probably a 0.5 less of investments during 2021. So I think what you’ll see is, you’ll see us flex the amount of investments from one year to the next. I think what we’re conscious of is that confidence in investing should come from seeing the revenue growth and seeing the revenue growth from past investments. And that’s what we’re seeing. We’re seeing the revenue growth on the past investments that we’ve made across the franchise, and I think that gives us the confidence to continue to carefully invest in some cases, accelerate that, but I think in in modest ways. I think the other part of our culture has been to – at the same time as we invest, find productivity and savings. And that’s – we think that’s an important part of how to run a business, but certainly a business that over time, we’re digitizing and automating should come with productivity, savings and engineering. And I think the other part of our business processes, and I think you hear this from our senior executives, the more we can drive in productivity saves, the more we feel comfortable in investing, and that’s a very – that’s a virtuous circle.\nRob Wildhack: Yes, that’s helpful.\nRonald O’Hanley: Rob, what…\nRob Wildhack: I’m sorry, Ron, go ahead.\nRonald O’Hanley: What I would just add to that is that it’s actually good news that we’re seeing opportunities to invest in the business. Because particularly as we’ve built out the Alpha platform, which was originally aimed at the asset management space in the traditional asset managers, we’re now starting to roll out Alpha for private markets. So it’s good that we’re seeing the opportunities. But I would underscore Eric’s point that notwithstanding that goodness, what we’re focused on is continuing to eke out higher and higher productivity. And we see more opportunities there. So we see the ability of this virtuous cycle to continue for quite a while longer. And the fact that there are investment opportunities, is actually a good thing, because it shows that notwithstanding the narrowness of our, where we operate, there’s plenty of places to grow.\nRob Wildhack: Got it. And fair to characterize it then that this level of investment maybe last year and this year gives you the capacity and the room to play both offense and defense?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes.\nRob Wildhack: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: I like that Ron’s. Question, on the deferred comp acceleration, I’m just curious, what level employ we – are we talking? And I’m asking because the deferred portion, obviously, you saying to get practices more competitive. So that is – that presumes that you are different more than peers and that going forward, you have a higher cash piece going forward. I’m just curious on, it’s probably included, obviously, in your expense guide, but what’s changing here and what why was well sticking?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes, Glenn, for the – the employees that are going to feel this would be our – not our most senior employees, it would be kind of the middle senior, lower senior, if you will, and down. So in our parlance, AVPs, VPs, MDs and some of the Senior Vice Presidents will fear.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay.\nEric Aboaf: And then, Glenn, just to give you a context, the – we’ve made this change, we had made one change five years back, and I think this now gets us to be competitive with the marketplace. And the way to the content – the facts that might help a little bit is way back when we had immediate cash in the 30% range of compensation for the average employee, the deferred cash was 40% and the equity, the deferred equity was 30%. That was a place that was completely out of market. We fixed about two-thirds of that five years ago and got to 50% immediate cash, 20% deferred cash, and 30% deferred equity. And now we’re – with this final change, we’re going to take that up to the immediate cash to 60% to 65% deferred cash to just 5% to 10%, mostly for the most senior folks and then the deferred equity stays at 30%. So we think we’re now in line with the market as part of this change. What does happen is you’ve got to crystallize some of the – some of these deferrals into the P&L in the current period. And then what that allows us to do is going forward to add to the cash mix. And because we’ve crystallized the previous deferrals, those don’t hit the P&L in the future, but the new cash will hit the P&L in the future. So this will be neutral to subsequent periods on the expense line.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Thank you. Very helpful. The one I was going through your four objectives, Ron, and the first three, I think, are straightforward, and I think everyone has high confidence in your ability to do those. I’m curious on the how to and what you’re doing, what you’re going to measure? And number four, which was the must be a higher performance oriented organization, just curious how you talk to us – how you can execute on that?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes. So I mean, this is an ongoing objective of ours, Glenn, and it really is around performance culture. And if you think about culture, which is a very used and sometimes maligned term, for us, it’s about desired behaviors. And on the flip side, kind of eliminating undesirable behaviors. So what we’re focused on is those desirable behaviors, all those – all related to kind of driving performance. I would argue that it’s even more important now than when we started a couple of years ago, because on top of everything else that we need in terms of serving our clients and serving our shareholders, we’re now operating, we’re now all operating in this hybrid world for the foreseeable future. That puts a burden – new burdens and new requirements on managers, particularly middle managers. So it’s all about being able to eke out the benefits, which are considerable in a hybrid world in terms of employee flexibility and some real estate cost savings and those kinds of things, but at the same time, making sure that we’re continuing to deliver where we are. So we think about performance in terms of – and we think about culture and high performance in terms of behaviors.\nGlenn Schorr: Excellent, Ron.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to circle back, Eric, I believe, just wanted to kind of clarify some of the points you made. I think you talked about BBH and the EBIT growth expected to accelerate here in 2022 up to 25%. So just to make sure I’m level setting correctly, you also talked about some strengths in servicing, it’s not all NII. That 25%, should we apply that to the $375 million that you provided previously, when you announced the deal? Or did that actual number shift from expectation? And am I using the right baseline? And then for the other disclosures you provided around the revenue and whatnot, should we – did those shakeout in line with expectations? Or did they work out to be a little better, as you alluded to? And how should we think about that baseline when we think about three quarters of a year here for them?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Let me – fair questions, Brennan. It’s Eric. We had, as you remember, accurately estimated their 2021 performance to be EBIT of about $375 million, and they came in right around that level. So we’re comfortable with that as a base case. And if you recall, we had shown 17% growth from 2020 to 2021 in our – in some of our documentation, as we announced, the Brown Brothers Investor Services acquisition. From a deal model perspective, at the time, we had expected off of the 2021 base to grow at about 15%. So, in line with the past part of that was the the equity market tailwinds continued to play through, and part of that was just good business performance, the – our Brown Brothers colleagues and investment services really tried a nice set of initiatives each year to try grows, client activity, and so forth. And what we’re finding now, it’s because of the equity market step off in the interest rate environment, and we expect to be roughly at about a 25% EBIT growth from 2021 to 2022. I think a portion of that is the – is on the equity – is on the servicing fee line, a portion that is on the fee line that comes from the sweeps, remember that comes through the feeds as well. And then a portion is from on-balance sheet NII, and I don’t have the pieces handy. But clearly, the interest rate tailwind is probably the more significant of those factors, and that’ll affect both the on-balance sheet and the sweat deposits.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay, great. Thank you for that clarification. And then a separate issue. From my second question, it looks like there’s a transition of leadership, seems like Cyrus is retiring in the asset management business. That’s been a business where there has been both speculation and open discussion with you all in the past about strategic direction and whatnot. What does the transition in leadership present as far as an opportunity to shift strategic direction? And what can you let us know about your updated thoughts on that business and whether or not a leadership transition is impacting the direction you want to go? Thanks.\nRonald O’Hanley: Brennan, I mean, as you can maybe see from our results, we’ve invested in that business. Over the years, the investments are paying off. We’d like the business. It’s very complimentary to the core servicing business, having one of the largest asset managers, also as our client of our core business has been able to let us have a bit of an R&D laboratory. There’s client overlap in certain segments like asset owners and sovereign wealth funds, that we’ve gotten better and better at it leveraging. So we’d like the business. We intend to stay in the business. Under Cyrus leadership, they’ve done a great job, and the numbers speak for themselves there. So I wouldn’t expect to see a broad strategic change here. Certainly not in that direction I just outlined. I mean, there’s always opportunities to do more and do better in all of our businesses. So we’ll want to continue to do that. We’ve got a very strong talent base there, but this is an attractive business and one in which we will look inside and out and get the right person to take us to the next level here, but we have full intention of continuing to plan and grow that business.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW.\nMichael Brown: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I appreciate the update on BBH and the – you made outlook there. And I guess as we move closer to that closing date, I was just curious that the change in the EBIT outlook in the operating environment, does that actually trigger any increase in the total consideration that will need to be be paid? Obviously, the implied valuation would be lower than at announcements. So that was just one thought that crossed my mind. And then the follow-up there is, can you just remind us of the unexpected fee synergies specifically, which ones do you feel confident that you can deliver on sooner after the close versus the one that will take more time to come through? Thank you.\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes, Mike, why don’t I start that and I’ll turn the synergy part of the question over to, Eric. But no, there’s no contingencies in the purchase price either up or down other than than the usual ones that you would expect in terms of risk management. So no, there’s no additional payment that will be due here.\nEric Aboaf: And, Mike, it’s Eric. Just on the synergies, I think each one of them has a cadence, some of which we did spell out I think on the cost synergies, which is the opportunity, and that’s obviously sometimes will come out of there base of expenses, sometimes our base of expenses, as we put the two together. We had estimated about 40% of our cost synergies would come in, in year one, and then the balance, year two and three, and that’s probably the single largest area. In terms of the the fee synergies, the balance sheet actions should come through relatively quickly. We can modulate the amount of swept versus on-balance sheet deposits, because we’ve got the capital resources plan for that. And I think that’s one of the ways that we create real value./ And then the last one on the fee revenue synergies. Now some of the FX kind of markets, synergies come in a little more quickly, right, because it’s about offering a broader set of, say, FX products on which were more capital intensive than simple swaps forwards, that is more about setting up clients, and then quickly being there for them. And then some of the servicing ones take a little longer and part of the sales cycle, but I think there’s a good mix. And obviously, as we work on closing and bring Brown Brothers in, part of what we’ve been doing is, as you expect kicking the tires on what are the opportunities, how to go the next round of definition on those, so that we can hit the ground running. And as I said, when we announced the deals, we’d like to meet or exceed our targets. And I think the exogenous market, tailwinds are part of that, but we’d also like to do it on through old fashioned execution as well.\nMichael Brown: Okay, great. Appreciate the color there. And maybe just one last one, just a quick clarification. Apologies, I missed. But did you quantify that discrete tax benefit? Or is the best way to think about that is just back into it after considering your typical tax rate?\nEric Aboaf: It’s – I wrestled, Mike, with that, because there were actually a series of tax benefits that came through this quarter, there was some closing of the previous year tax books, there were some foreign credits that accrue in those jurisdictions, which then help our GAAP taxes, and then there’s some foreign credits that then kind of map back into the U.S. as a tax payments as deduction. So there’s a series of them. I think the best way to do it is to probably take our full year tax rates are typically in the 17% to 19% range. So, you take the midpoint of that, think about full year this year now with this – with these discrete, which were more elevated than usual in a good way got us to closer to 15% tax rates. I think the difference is probably the – you might call the lumpy piece. What I do – what I would though also notice that I think tax planning has been the kind of thing that we’ve done for many years. We do it. We’re always on the bright side of the line, and we do it carefully. We – part of it being an international bank. We, like other international banks, are able to do some a modest amount of tax planning. And so you’ll see it, I think it’s – we see that come through the P&L annually, it just tends to be a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter and it was a little more lumpy, good than usual this particular quarter.\nMichael Brown: Okay, understood, I appreciate. The taxes are always complicated subject. So thanks for the color there, Eric.\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning. Maybe circle back on the deposit opportunity for BBH. Just to clarify, I think you said there’s right now $10 billion of deposits set on the balance sheet at BBH and then $55 million additional in the sweep program. And I think initially, you’re planning to bring about a total of $20 billion, inclusive of the deposits on the balance sheet over to, say, if you convert, initially, I think $14 billion was the conversion to get you to $20 billion. Maybe if you could just update us on the plan for 2022, if you do close at quarter-end in the first quarter of what you’d like to bring on? And then maybe just talk more strategically about what – maybe what kind of portion of that sweep opportunity you might bring on to on the balance sheet, I guess capital submitting?\nEric Aboaf: Hey, Brian, it’s Eric. I think you have a good estimate of those just for the broader group, I think we said about $5 billion to $10 billion are on the balance sheet today. About $65 billion are off-balance sheet and swept. And as we consummate the acquisition, and we’re targeting the first quarter, we said it – at the end of the first quarter, we’re targeting, we said it could be in the second quarters, this stuff just takes time. We’ll – we’re looking to bring on the $5 billion to $10 billion that they have on the balance sheet, and probably another 10ish or so, that is swept. I think over time, the question is really, at what interest rate levels do we operate at if we’re at prevailing short rates of 50 basis points, let’s say, then on balance sheet deposits aren’t terribly attractive. But when you hit prevailing rates of 100 bps, or 200 bps, and obviously, you can do this across different currencies, then you’re more inclined to bring more on balance sheet. And so we think of it as a range. I think we also, though, are quite – we want to be quite thoughtful about maintaining a program that, that works. It works well, for our clients, and the Brown Brothers Investment Services clients. It works well for a number of global financial institutions, that they have relationships with that they sweep, primarily dollar deposits to who appreciate those deposits. And so we certainly want to maintain the program for suites, want to maintain it in size. But you can certainly see swings of another $10 billion beyond the initial move potentially. But we’re – I think we’ll see when we get there. And part of it will be discussions with the clients themselves on one hand, and part of it will be the with the counterparties. And I think there’ll be goodness and opportunity here in most circumstances.\nBrian Bedell: That’s great color. And maybe just this segue to second question on deposit beta expectations. I think you mentioned, you thought they might be the similar to the last hiking cycle, just to confirm that. It seemed like it moved around a bit during the cycle, but kind of ended up around, it looks like a little over 30% of its deposit beta relative to Fed funds rates at the time. I don’t know maybe if you can clarify that and if you think that would be similar this cycle and obviously, if you would – you’d be treating those BBH deposits in a similar fashion or do they have a different profile?\nEric Aboaf: Sure, Brian, and it was actually a good opportunity as we see rates rise and the likelihood of Fed funds, but we did get a chance to go back and revisit what we both said and what we saw in from a deposit beta standpoint back in 2015, 2016, 2017. I do expect the Brown Brothers deposits behave similarly to ours. They are primarily with asset managers. They are currency by currency similar to ours. But if you go back, and I think we were good about disclosing our quarter-on-quarter interest-bearing deposit betas, and usually you have to do it by currency, right? So, because of how the betas play through. But in the first rate, the first one or two rate hikes, we saw and expect, again, to see deposit betas and, call it, 10% range, maybe 10% to 15% range, but it’s quite low. When you get to the third, fourth or fifth hike, you’re in the 30% range plus or minus some as you like into the rate cycle. And it’s really, when you get in the past, they’re in the fifth, sixth, seventh hike, where you’re likely to get closer to 50% interest-bearing deposit betas. Now, I’d like to get there. I – we’d be pleased with with 50% if we get there with that level prevailing rates. But there’s – I think there’s a good opportunity here, because in truth, we’ve been quite limited in our ability to earn NII that covers our cost of capital. And so a lot of this is just catch up in a to a levels that are more in line with the long-term averages.\nBrian Bedell: That’s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I’ll turn the call over to Ronald O’Hanley for closing remarks.\nRonald O’Hanley: Thank you, operator, and thanks to all on the call for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Ronald O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the dedication and strong performance of State Street employees during the past year. These team members remain central to the continued successful execution of our strategy as we help to create better outcomes for the world's investors. Together, we accomplished a great deal in 2021, including higher fee and total revenue generation, successful execution against both sales effectiveness and client retention goals that is driving growth and business momentum, as well as announcing the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services. All of this would not have been possible without our employees' hard work, skill and commitment. Slide 3 of our presentation highlights the progress we made during 2021, with both of our business segments performing strongly as we advance towards achieving our medium-term financial targets. Within the Investment Servicing business, we enhanced – our enhanced core strategy, combined with our strategic pivot to an enterprise outsourced solutions provider across the front, middle and back office, manifested itself in stronger business momentum and revenue growth in 2021, which you can see along the top of the slide. As we successfully diversify and broaden our wins by region and client segments, we achieved record AUC/A servicing wins of $3.5 trillion in 2021 and continued to deploy our enterprise outsourcing capabilities underpinned by our integrated front to back Alpha platform. We announced nine additional Alpha wins in 2021, with 10 Alpha clients now live at year-end. We also continue to enhance our product capabilities in 2021, launching Alpha for private markets as well as our new State Street Digital division. At Global Advisors, we executed well against our long-term strategy, which contributed to a number of records for that business in 2021, including revenues, assets under management and ETF inflows. Importantly, Global Advisors full year pre-tax margin expanded by over 6 percentage points in 2021 to a record 32%, deepening the value of our investment management franchise to State Street's results. Our SPDR business performed particularly well in 2021, gaining U.S. ETF flow market share, including low-cost and active in addition to the record inflows I just mentioned. As I look back at 2021, I am particularly pleased with our client impact, improvement in our sales effectiveness and heightened focus on client satisfaction, service quality and retention across our businesses, together with a favorable equity market backdrop, helps to drive a stronger revenue performance. Notably, full year servicing and management fees each reach our highest level on record in 2021, with total fee revenue increasing by 5% year-on-year and exceeding $10 billion for the first time. While we delivered a strong revenue performance in 2021, expense management remained a key focus for us, with company-wide productivity and engineering efforts achieving approximately $330 million of gross expense savings. Because of our strong revenue and sales performance in 2021 and the healthy pipeline in front of us, these efficiency savings allowed us to fund investments in our talent, technology and business in the fourth quarter to drive future growth. Even with this increase in investment, total expenses will contain relative to revenue growth, helping to drive a significant improvement in a number of key financial metrics that you can see on the bottom of the slide. Despite record low interest rates and excluding notable items, we delivered meaningful full year pre-tax margin expansion, positive fee and total operating leverage and EPS growth in 2021, and we expect to do this again in 2022. Turning to Slide 4, I will briefly touch on our fourth quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. 4Q 2021 EPS increased 28% year-over-year, or 18%, excluding notable items. The strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by solid total fee revenue growth, which more than offset interest rate headwinds on NII, leading to a good fourth quarter total revenue performance. We delivered 130 basis points of total positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter, excluding notable items. Importantly, we again expanded State Street's pre-tax margin, which increased by more than a percentage point relative to the year-ago period to 28% in the fourth quarter, excluding notable items. The solid business momentum that we saw during 2021 continued into the fourth quarter, which you can see in the middle of the slide. AUC/A increased to a record $43.7 trillion at quarter-end and new asset servicing wins amounted to $332 billion for the quarter. AUC/A won, but yet to be installed, was $2.8 trillion at quarter-end, while Charles Rivers' annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter increased 9% year-over-year to $244 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $4.1 trillion at quarter-end, management fees increased to a record $530 million in the fourth quarter, benefiting from higher year-on-year average equity market levels and record inflows to our ETF franchise. Turning to our balance sheet at the bottom of the slide. Capital return remains a key part of our medium-term targets and we recognize its importance to our shareholders. As you know, we suspended common share repurchases in Q3 in connection with our intended purchase of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services. We currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of this year, in line with our previous expectations. To conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased with the strategic operational and financial progress we demonstrated in 2021. We meaningfully improved our full year financial performance across a number of key metrics, creating value for our shareholders and advancing us towards our medium-term financial targets. Looking ahead, I have four core strategic objectives for 2022, which are aimed at helping us achieve our vision for the organization and position the business for future success. First is to continue to grow revenue by executing on a number of key strategic priorities this year, including completion of our pivot to an enterprise outsourcer underpinned by our Alpha platform build out; continuing to develop key product offerings and capabilities, particularly private markets; and further strengthening sales and client management capabilities and processes. Second, the successful integration of BBH Investor Services is a key priority. The proposed acquisition is a financially compelling use of capital. And once closed, it will strengthen our market leadership by creating the world's largest custodian, expand and deepen our international reach, further propel our Alpha strategy and add strong talent that will supplement our focus on client and service excellence and expertise. Third, as we did in 2021, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization. We are developing and implementing a simplified, scalable, configurable end-to-end operating model. This more scalable model will allow us to deliver increased client quality, operational capacity, speed and resilience. Fourth, we must continue to build an even higher performing organization. A performance culture and improved employee experience will enable us to sustain a more diverse, engaged and empowered team with the experience, capabilities and desired behaviors required for further – for future growth. These four goals reflect our relentless focus on performance and achieving our medium-term financial targets. I have confidence that we'll be able to meet our strategic and client goals, while also delivering positive fee and total operating leverage and expanding our pre-tax margin each year through our medium-term horizon, aided by the strong momentum we are seeing across our businesses. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Jim, it's Ron. Let me take that. I think that the growth is reasonably broad-based in the sense that it's, firstly from our investments – an ongoing investments in the ETF business. So you saw lots of strength in the core SPDR offerings, which are really instruments of choice for the – for large institutional investors and good growth in areas where we invested active ETFs, fixed income, the low-cost ETFs or non-U.S. So we expect to continue to see a good performance there, particularly as we've worked to solidify our position with institutional investors. Secondly, in the institutional – in the traditional institutional space, the team's done a lot of work in developing products that are companions to the core index business. We have a great client roster, and we've seen some diversification in the – in that business. Then finally, we've got a great cash business. And obviously, it ebbs and flows as cash does itself, but will also benefit a little bit from rising rate environments as is the remainder of the fee waivers goes away. So it's really across the board. Sure. There's a lot there, Steve, in your question. So let me take it kind of from the near end timeframe to further out. We've – I think we're pretty comfortable with our capital guidance that will be at the low end of our 10% to 11% range for CET1 in the first quarter. That includes both the SACCR being implemented and the consummation of the Brown Brothers acquisition. So, that I think will carry us through at the low end of our range for the first half of this year. And we – we're, I think comfortable with both of those. As we go through the year in the second quarter, we'd certainly like to start the buyback. We'll see at what pace the pace of a buyback start will depend on the kind of the exact capital ratios as we hit first quarter and then second quarter. We'll see how OCI swings either positively or negatively. And so I think that then sets us up to start buying back stock in second quarter and then proceeding at pace in the third quarter, fourth quarter and beyond. And then I think at that point, we're back to trying to, or we're not trying, but operating within our guidance, that capital return should be in the 80%-plus of earnings. And that puts us, I think, in a way that we continue to return through dividends and buybacks capital in a nice, comfortable way. So, anyway, a nice path forward. But first half of this year, I think, low end of our ranges, and then the second quarter, and then third quarter, fourth quarter, we start to reinstate and then accelerate in buybacks to a comfortable level. The Basel III refinements, Basel IV end game, there are different ways, different vocabulary out there, certainly come to pass. Clearly, we'll get some benefits on the loan book that we have a smaller loan book than others, though, we'll probably get some headwinds from the funnel and to review the trading book, and then some headwinds from the ops risk capital charges. So my guess is it'll be a bit of a headwind. But like I said before, it's been all factored into our capital ratio guidance. We generate quite a bit of capital each year. And we feel comfortable that we can continue to deliver on our medium-term targets of returning 80% or more of earnings back to shareholders. Hey, Gerard. Rob, what... What I would just add to that is that it's actually good news that we're seeing opportunities to invest in the business. Because particularly as we've built out the Alpha platform, which was originally aimed at the asset management space in the traditional asset managers, we're now starting to roll out Alpha for private markets. So it's good that we're seeing the opportunities. But I would underscore Eric's point that notwithstanding that goodness, what we're focused on is continuing to eke out higher and higher productivity. And we see more opportunities there. So we see the ability of this virtuous cycle to continue for quite a while longer. And the fact that there are investment opportunities, is actually a good thing, because it shows that notwithstanding the narrowness of our, where we operate, there's plenty of places to grow. Yes. Yes, Glenn, for the – the employees that are going to feel this would be our – not our most senior employees, it would be kind of the middle senior, lower senior, if you will, and down. So in our parlance, AVPs, VPs, MDs and some of the Senior Vice Presidents will fear. Yes. So I mean, this is an ongoing objective of ours, Glenn, and it really is around performance culture. And if you think about culture, which is a very used and sometimes maligned term, for us, it's about desired behaviors. And on the flip side, kind of eliminating undesirable behaviors. So what we're focused on is those desirable behaviors, all those – all related to kind of driving performance. I would argue that it's even more important now than when we started a couple of years ago, because on top of everything else that we need in terms of serving our clients and serving our shareholders, we're now operating, we're now all operating in this hybrid world for the foreseeable future. That puts a burden – new burdens and new requirements on managers, particularly middle managers. So it's all about being able to eke out the benefits, which are considerable in a hybrid world in terms of employee flexibility and some real estate cost savings and those kinds of things, but at the same time, making sure that we're continuing to deliver where we are. So we think about performance in terms of – and we think about culture and high performance in terms of behaviors. Brennan, I mean, as you can maybe see from our results, we've invested in that business. Over the years, the investments are paying off. We'd like the business. It's very complimentary to the core servicing business, having one of the largest asset managers, also as our client of our core business has been able to let us have a bit of an R&D laboratory. There's client overlap in certain segments like asset owners and sovereign wealth funds, that we've gotten better and better at it leveraging. So we'd like the business. We intend to stay in the business. Under Cyrus leadership, they've done a great job, and the numbers speak for themselves there. So I wouldn't expect to see a broad strategic change here. Certainly not in that direction I just outlined. I mean, there's always opportunities to do more and do better in all of our businesses. So we'll want to continue to do that. We've got a very strong talent base there, but this is an attractive business and one in which we will look inside and out and get the right person to take us to the next level here, but we have full intention of continuing to plan and grow that business. Yes, Mike, why don't I start that and I'll turn the synergy part of the question over to, Eric. But no, there's no contingencies in the purchase price either up or down other than than the usual ones that you would expect in terms of risk management. So no, there's no additional payment that will be due here. Thank you, operator, and thanks to all on the call for joining us."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognize in the quarter outlined on Slide 5. First, we recognize acquisition restructuring costs, most of which were related to CRD and whose integration is now complete. Second, we recognize the net repositioning release of $3 million, which consists of occupancy costs of $29 million as we continue to reduce our footprint and a release of previously accrued compensation costs were $32 million, as attrition picked up and we redeployed staff more effectively than anticipated. Third, we saw an opportunity to correct an imbalance in the competitiveness of our compensation program by accelerating expenses associated with certain deferred cash incentive awards. The impact of the acceleration increased expenses by $147 million in this quarter. This change will allow us to realign the mix of immediate versus deferred cash in our incentive compensation awards in future periods, which will make our pay practices competitive and enable us to better attract talent in an increasingly tight talent market. Our mix of deferred equity remains unchanged. Finally, you'll see that in the fourth quarter also benefited from a $58 million gain on sale legacy LIBOR base securities previously classified as held to maturity. This sale and this quarters' higher than usual tax benefits help to offset some of the deferred compensation expense acceleration I just mentioned. Turning to Slide 6, I'll begin my review of both fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. As you can see on the top left of the slide, we finished the fourth quarter with strong revenue growth compared to 4Q 2020. 4Q 2021 fee revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting strong growth in servicing fees, management fees and CRD revenues, only partially offset by lower FX trading services. 4Q expenses were well managed, delivering positive total operating leverage notwithstanding the significant 2021 NII headwind. 4Q pre-tax margin is up more than 1 percentage point year-on-year and ROE is up almost 2 percentage points. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2021 revenue performance. As Ron highlighted earlier, 2021 was a record year for us for fee revenues. And despite historically low interest rates in 2021, I'm quite pleased that for the full year, we still delivered positive operating leverage of more than a percentage point improvement in pre-tax margin and EPS growth in the double digits. Turning to Slide 7, you'll see our Investment Services balanced growth remain strong as we saw record AUC/A the end of the fourth quarter of $43.7 a year-on-year increase of 13%, largely driven by higher market levels, client flows and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A growth was muted as markets were pretty mixed. At Global Advisors, AUM at year-end increased 19% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter to a record $4.1 trillion. The year-on-year in sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher market levels, coupled with net inflows. Of note, we reported strong net inflows during the fourth quarter of almost $80 billion. Our global SPDR ETF business recorded the highest ever quarter, driven by strong U.S. flows, pushing total net ETF inflows to $107 billion for the full year. Turning to Slide 8, you can see another quarter of good business momentum. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased 6% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels, client activity inflows and positive net new business again. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about a full point of currency translation. On a sequential basis, I would remind you that while the S&P was up on average, international markets were down, so markets were relatively neutral. Servicing fees were down 1%, primarily due to client activity and adjustments and the impact and appreciating U.S. dollar, partially offset by another quarter of positive net new business. AUC/A wins totaled a solid $332 billion in the fourth quarter, which gets us to a record $3.5 trillion new wins across client segments and regions for the full year and our pipeline remains strong. At quarter-end, AUC/A won, but yet to be installed, amounted to $2.8 trillion, without representing a nice proportion, which reflects a unique value proposition and our competitive strengths as the only front to back offering from a single provider. Turning to Slide 9, fourth quarter management fees reached a record $530 million, up 8% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in an investment management pre-tax margin of 34% for fourth quarter. The year-on-year management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF inflows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by previously reported client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers of $20 million in the quarter. The quarter-on-quarter results were largely driven by a slight uptick in equity market daily averages. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by both strong quarterly momentum and full year results. We were particularly pleased that the actions that we've previously taken over the years in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises delivered growth over the course of 2021. Regarding management fee money market waivers, we currently expect that they will come in at approximately $5 million less in the first quarter of 2022 based on an anticipated March Fed rate hike, which will be included in our 2022 outlook. Turning to Slide 10, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. FX trading services was down 7% year-on-year, reflecting lower FX volatility and lower volumes in our standing instruction business. On a sequential basis, FX revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by higher FX volatility, partially offset by lower volumes. Moving to securities finance. Fourth quarter fees increased 16% year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher clients securities loan balances and new business wins and enhanced custody. On a sequential basis, fees were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances. Finally, fourth quarter software and processing fees were down 4% year-on-year and 2% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by lower market-related adjustments, partially offset by continued growth in CRD, which I'll turn to next. Moving to Slide 11, I'd like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong standalone CRD results in the quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 13%. Full year standalone revenue growth was a 11% year-on-year year, which makes this the second year in a row where we grew the business revenue in the double-digit range. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continue to grow nicely as we onboarded and converted more clients to the cloud. SaaS clients now represent nearly half of our CRD client base. In addition, we achieved record new bookings of $62 million for full year 2021, with a healthy revenue backlog of $117 million at quarter-end, demonstrating the continued business momentum as we head into 2022 supported by the Alpha – by the State Street Alpha value proposition. Turning to Alpha on the bottom right of this slide. Full year 2021 was a busy year, as we announced nine new Alpha mandates and nearly doubled the amount of wins we've achieved since inception. At year-end, we have 10 total live Alpha clients. We've also been busy enhancing our Alpha product offering this year. In addition to launching Alpha for private markets and our acquisition of Mercatus in the third quarter, we also went live with our Alpha data platform in the fourth quarter, which is our cloud native platform providing enterprise data management and access to all the data and analytics that our clients use to perform their daily end-to-end investment processes. Turning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII was down 3% year-on-year, mainly driven by the impact of a low 2021 interest rates on the investment portfolio yields, partially offset by another quarter of higher loan balances, as well as growth in deposits and the investment portfolio. Relative to the third quarter, 4Q NII came in 1% lower, primarily as a result of the expected normalization of premium memorization. As you may recall, third quarter 2021 included an episodic benefit worth about $7 million, which we previously noted wasn't expected to repeat in fourth quarter. We do, however, see continued premium amortization slowing. We, like many of you, are excited about the rise we've seen in long-end rates this year. However, short rates have been flat so far and it's really the prospect of Fed action in the March timeframe, which would have a significant benefit on NII. On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Average assets increased 4% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by higher deposit levels. We consciously allowed average deposits to float up this past quarter, which we then expect to monetize in a period of rising interest rates. Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were up 1% year-on-year as we previously decided to increase incentive compensation to reflect strong year-on-year performance and pulled forward some investments in the business. At the end of the year, however, we also experienced some higher than expected episodic expenses. Medical costs were higher as we saw ramp-up in year-end claims, we saw some elevated IT vendor costs and we realized higher marketing spend associated with GA volumes. Compared to 4Q 2020, on a line item basis excluding notable items, compensation and employee benefits was up 2%, driven by higher incentive compensation medical costs, partially offset by lower headcount and salaries. Notably, our continued focus on digitization, automation, as well as resource discipline has helped us reduce our headcount this year by 2 percentage points, even as we onboarded larger deals and process more transaction volume. Information systems and communications were up 11% due to continued investment in our technology infrastructure and resiliency, as well as the equipment expenses as we move more activities to the cloud. Transaction processing was down 7%, primarily driven by lower market data and brokerage costs. Occupancy was down 6%, reflecting the benefits from eliminating another 5,000 seats, and achieving 115% occupancy rate, and other expenses were down too. Overall, we're pleased this year with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline. Excluding the impact of currency translation with approximately 1 percentage point, full year 2021 expenses would have been flat. And in a year where fee revenue growth grew by mid single digits, we meaningfully expanded our pre-tax margin and generated positive total and fee operating leverage despite a challenging interest rate environment. Moving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels, whether without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements. As of quarter-end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 14.2% increased 0.7 percentage points quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting an outsized reduction of about $5 billion in RWA related to the impact of FX mark-to-markets and higher retained earnings. We expect our RWAs to increase in the first quarter to more normalized business levels and the effects of expected regulatory changes coming in 2022, all of which has been previously considered in our capital guidance. Our Tier 1 leverage decreased slightly quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by higher client deposits, and lastly returned a total of $209 million to shareholders in the form of fourth quarter dividends. As previously communicated, we expect our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges for the first half of 2022, inclusive of the implementation of SACCR and the expected closing of the Brown Brothers Investment – Investor Services acquisition. Turning to Slide 15. You can see a summary of our 4Q 2021 and full year 2021 results. I've already covered fourth quarter in detail. So let me say a few words about our full year results before jumping into our outlook for 2022. In summary, we're pleased with our strong performance this year. Notwithstanding the challenging industry environment, we delivered a 5% increase in total fee revenue for the year with servicing and management fees reaching our highest levels on record. Our expenses for the full year remained well controlled, and despite higher revenue-related costs and investments in our business and people. As a result, even in last year's low rate environment, we delivered positive operating leverage and we're able to drive pre-tax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced medium-term targets. And with that, I'll turn to outlook. On Slide 16, let me cover our full year 2022 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which do not yet include the previously announced acquisition of the Brown Brothers Investor Services. We continue to target a closing by the end of the first quarter, although the timing could fall in the second quarter. We are in the process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals, some of which have already been secured. The process is proceeding at a slower pace than anticipated with many regulators around the world addressing the high volume of global M&A activity. That said, given the current higher equity markets step off and new interest rate forwards, we now expect about 25% year-on-year year EBIT growth for the acquired business for each quarter in the first year post closing instead of just 15% year-on-year EBIT growth in our original acquisition deal modeling. Now, as I usually do, let me first share some assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, our rate outlook largely aligns the current forward curve and assumes we see three U.S. rate hikes in 2022 with the first hike occurring in March. We are also assuming around 5 percentage point to point growth for equity markets in 2022, as well as further normalized FX market volatility, which influences our trading businesses. As for currency translation, we expect the U.S. dollar will be stronger for the year, which will be a headwind to revenues, but mostly offset as a benefit to expenses. So beginning with revenue. For the full year, we currently expect that fee revenue will be up 3% to 4%, with servicing fees growing 2% to 3%, both include about a point of currency translation headwind for 2022. Regarding the first quarter of 2022, we expect fee revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year, given equity market expectations and continue business momentum, with servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and management fees expected to be up 8% to 9%. For full year NII, depending on the timing of the projected rate hikes, we expect 2022 NII to be up 10% to 12% on a year-on-year basis. Regarding first quarter of 2022, we expect NII to be up 3% to 4% year-over-year and still flattish sequentially. Now turning to expenses. As you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex-notables will be up just 1.5% to 2% on a nominal basis in 2022, as we continue to invest in the business and our people, while driving both positive total and fee operating leverage. We currently assume that this includes a 1 percentage point benefit to expenses due to this stronger U.S. dollar. You can also see on the walk that for full year 2022, we expect another year of growth saves of approximately 3 to 4 percentage points, which will help fund variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like Alpha, digital, tech infrastructure and automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2022, we expect year-on-year expense growth to be largely in line with the full year guide, and includes the seasonal compensation expenses, which occur in the first quarter. All in all, our plan is to invest behind the revenues and deliver both positive total and positive fee operating leverage. Finally, we estimate our effective tax rate to be in the 17% to 19% range for 2022. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Alex, it's Eric. Happy New Year to you, too. Let me cover fees and then servicing fees, which I think is where your focus. Our guide for total fee revenue is up 3% to 4% for the year, our guide for servicing fees up 2% to 3%. And obviously, that includes about a percentage point of headwind from foreign exchange. So in effect, the servicing fees are up, for example, 3% to 4% in our guide, adjusted for currency translation. If you think about the drivers, we've factored in all the known events, both our growth, our installations, net new business and so forth. If you want to peel it apart a little more deeply, we start off at a good equity market level and we expect some year-on-year growth from equity markets, that's probably worth about 2 percentage points of a tailwind to growth. Flows and client activity, which – variable is probably worth another percentage point and part of our kind of fee structures. Net new business is – continues to tick up. We expect core net new business to be up 2%. And that obviously includes all the new onboarding, offset by any attrition. So that's on a net basis. And then obviously, there's just the usual, 2%, grind down of pricing. And that kind of gets you to the low end of our range. We think there's some upside, which is why adjusted for currency, the servicing fee guide is in the 3% to 4% range. And what it does is, it represents the continued acceleration of our business towards our medium-term targets, which are really in the 4% to 5% range. Alex, that's a fair question. And you can see that part of the way we create some, I'll call it insulation for ourselves as we think about equity markets and where they might go, whether it's up a lot of modestly flat or down, is that we've designed our plans with a view that we should and intend to deliver a couple points of operating leverage, and actually a couple points of fee operating leverage, right? That that couple of points gives us some flexibility to handle some variability in the – in what happens in actuality in equity markets. I think, certainly will move within our range based on what we see. Obviously, if we see a market – an equity market correction of down 5%, or down 10%, we'll do everything we can to come in below our range. And certainly, we can flex in this business, a full point can be flexed. It's not easy, but it can be flexed. And that would be the approach that that we take. But we're confident with kind of the level of equity markets they are today. Part of this – part of what we see is fairly – a fairly nominal uptick in equity markets. So we think there's a good kind of middle of the fairway plan, but we'll certainly flex it, we, to the extent that we can. Sure. Jim, it's Eric. The business that Brown Brothers has run on the investment services side is performing well. So what we've seen is, with the higher equity markets, we've seen their servicing fees come in a bit stronger for this coming year. I think that deposits both on-balance sheet and the swept ones are within the range of what we've seen. And I think we describe those as bit under $10 billion on-balance sheet and a bit over $65 billion swept and they're coming in right around that range. And that's our expectation for 2022. The – both the on and off-balance sheet do have a good translation into higher revenues as rates move up. And the on-balance sheet betas are similar to ours. And we've – we had very nice betas in the early part of the last rate cycle and expect to have that again on ours and on there. And then the off-balance suites also have betas. They're not quite as strong as deposits, but they're in the range actually and that also will provide some very nice, I think, fee growth as we take on that business. Steve, it's Eric. Let me do that in reverse order. I think the front book and the back book are starting to converge in the investment portfolio. And you'll see that our investment portfolio yields took a – another small tick downward this quarter in fourth quarter. But starting in first quarter, we'll see that relatively flat and then you'll see a slow progression upward. So we're comfortable with where we are in terms of long rates. And obviously, the higher the loan rates come in, the better off, we'll be. The NI uptick for this year and then let me get to the question around balances and quantitative tightening, I think, is just comfortably dependent on the Fed increases. I think we're showing 10% to 12% expectations in NII, low more than half of that is off of rising short-term U.S. rates, about a little less than a quarter is off rising non-U.S. short-term rates, and then the last portion is off of the rise in long rates. So, we're really geared towards the front end rates, and then that flows through directly to balances. For deposit balances, we currently expect U.S. and international deposit balances to be flattish, I'd say this this year. And I think we're all wrestling with what's the pace of the Fed's actions in terms of rising interest rates. When does that start? And then when did they start with the – with some amount of quantitative tightening? And I think it's just helpful to book in this. There has been a lot of discussion about quantitative tightening over the last week or two. Certainly, it will happen. If you go back to the last cycle, which was just three, four years ago, so not a long time away, quantitative tightening started two years after the first rate rise, and a full year after the second and third and fourth, kind of that steeper part of the rate rising cycle. And so, I think quantitative tightening, though, there'll be a bid ask range on this. This is something to expect in 2023, more than 2022. And we'll thereby and then have some effect on deposits. How much, it's hard to tell. As you know, this cycle, we've controlled some of the uptick in deposits. We had pushed them off in third quarter, as you recall, let them back in this quarter. We'll certainly see some deposits ebb downwards in 2023 and 2024, perhaps, or potentially just say flattish. Because the question is the pace of the quantitative tightening. And if you recall, last time around, just, I guess, three, four years ago, I think the Fed felt like it tightened too much, right, and created some disruptions in the short-term money markets. And so while we expect some tightening to happen in, say, a year-and-a-half from now, or thereabouts, we'll see. The – I think the pace of the tightening maybe more moderate. But anyway, we'll see. We'll see. That's, call it, 2023 topic. I think, 2022 should be fairly straight. Yes. I didn't in the prepared remarks. But the rough amount, we carry typically about $115 billion of RWAs, it was a little less this quarter. SACCR is – will cost us in the first quarter, just over $10 billion. And we've got offsetting actions worth about half of that – about half. So call it around $5 billion. So I think net basis, it's probably worth about $5 of RWA. But as I said before in my prepared remarks, this has all been factored in to our capitol guidance that we gave back over the last several quarters, and we're confirming and affirming that we'll be within our ranges in the first half of the year. Sure. Gerard, it's Eric. It's really a mix, I think, maybe almost if I just think about the ranges, it's a bit under half, that's thrown by U.S. markets closer to probably, I don't know, a 30ish European markets and then Australian emerging markets just because of the, in some cases, the higher fee rates is also important, that could be worth 20%, 25%. The other, as you remember, we have part of our book is fixed income assets that we service. And so, that's why equity market tailwinds effect part of our book, but not all of our book in rising rates, we've thought the opposite effect in – on the fixed income side. What I – just as we from a planning purposes as we go into the year, though, on a point-to-point basis or if we were to stay flat from now through the end of the year versus the average of last year of 2021, that in and of itself should give us at least point and a half of servicing fee lifts. And then what we're talking about is whether the point-to-point growth from December 31 to – 2022 December 31, can give us that extra half a point. So, I think that's how you get the roughly 2 percentage point tailwind that we expect, somebody has in a way baked in assuming markets don't go down. And then a smaller piece is coming from some modest appreciation. Yes. We – the duration of the investment portfolio, we inch down this quarter, you could have seen that in the NII slide that we had, I think, we're at about 2.9 years. So, trended down a bit from the last quarters – last couple of quarters. And right now, we're a little more comfortable. We've been investing in the belly of the curve, kind of a two to five-year range. I think the 10-year up through 2 percentage points is quite comfortable for us, including from an OCI management standpoint. I think if you get good bit of buffs, 2 percentage points on the 10-year, you kind of have a – you got a double effect. On one hand, you get an OCI ahead, which obviously creeps back over time. So it's temporary. And the other hand, you celebrate higher rates flowing through the investment portfolios over the coming quarters. So, I think it's mix, but net positive if we have some sort of spike at the back end. But it would affect just the mechanics of how we operate quarter-to-quarter on the margin. Thank you, Gerard. Rob, it's Eric. Loan growth has been good for us the last, say, couple of years, to be honest. I think we've comfortably driven loan growth quarter after quarter, up in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, we continue to see good client demand, but we also shifted some – we also added some CLOs in loan form, as we reduced the CLOs and securities form from the investment portfolio. So, there was a bit of a shift. That said, I think, in general, what we're comfortable doing is continue to grow poor loans, because that's – we won't always have a shift every quarter, this is more episodic, just as we rebalance and think about stress testing and how to operate efficiently with our multiple constraints. But we're still comfortable, continue to grow this loan portfolio in the low double-digit range, it won't happen every quarter. There's a little bit of seasonality, but we continue to see quite strong demand from our alternatives clients and private equity capital call financing. We see demand in some parts of the alternative and real estate markets that we play in. And the biggest focus I'd say is as we lend more and deploy capital to our clients, a lot of what we do is work with them and make sure that's part of a broader relationship because that's where it really is renew motive for us and for them and helps us grow the – helps us build the reputation and the momentum to build the fee line as well. It's hard to forecast the future. The amount of investments is partly around what's table stakes in the marketplace and partly around where do we see opportunities to differentiate our offerings. And clearly, you've seen us invest in particular in Alpha, in the front office and Alpha that spans into the middle and back office. And we're also finding opportunities in the back office to invest through sort of feature functionality enhancements and custody in some areas of accounting, which also is attractive in segment by segment. So it's hard for me to say, what's the necessary amount of investments, we think there's a range. We think last year, we probably invested a bit less than this, probably, instead of 5% to 6%, I'd say, there was probably a 0.5 less of investments during 2021. So I think what you'll see is, you'll see us flex the amount of investments from one year to the next. I think what we're conscious of is that confidence in investing should come from seeing the revenue growth and seeing the revenue growth from past investments. And that's what we're seeing. We're seeing the revenue growth on the past investments that we've made across the franchise, and I think that gives us the confidence to continue to carefully invest in some cases, accelerate that, but I think in in modest ways. I think the other part of our culture has been to – at the same time as we invest, find productivity and savings. And that's – we think that's an important part of how to run a business, but certainly a business that over time, we're digitizing and automating should come with productivity, savings and engineering. And I think the other part of our business processes, and I think you hear this from our senior executives, the more we can drive in productivity saves, the more we feel comfortable in investing, and that's a very – that's a virtuous circle. And then, Glenn, just to give you a context, the – we've made this change, we had made one change five years back, and I think this now gets us to be competitive with the marketplace. And the way to the content – the facts that might help a little bit is way back when we had immediate cash in the 30% range of compensation for the average employee, the deferred cash was 40% and the equity, the deferred equity was 30%. That was a place that was completely out of market. We fixed about two-thirds of that five years ago and got to 50% immediate cash, 20% deferred cash, and 30% deferred equity. And now we're – with this final change, we're going to take that up to the immediate cash to 60% to 65% deferred cash to just 5% to 10%, mostly for the most senior folks and then the deferred equity stays at 30%. So we think we're now in line with the market as part of this change. What does happen is you've got to crystallize some of the – some of these deferrals into the P&L in the current period. And then what that allows us to do is going forward to add to the cash mix. And because we've crystallized the previous deferrals, those don't hit the P&L in the future, but the new cash will hit the P&L in the future. So this will be neutral to subsequent periods on the expense line. Yes. Let me – fair questions, Brennan. It's Eric. We had, as you remember, accurately estimated their 2021 performance to be EBIT of about $375 million, and they came in right around that level. So we're comfortable with that as a base case. And if you recall, we had shown 17% growth from 2020 to 2021 in our – in some of our documentation, as we announced, the Brown Brothers Investor Services acquisition. From a deal model perspective, at the time, we had expected off of the 2021 base to grow at about 15%. So, in line with the past part of that was the the equity market tailwinds continued to play through, and part of that was just good business performance, the – our Brown Brothers colleagues and investment services really tried a nice set of initiatives each year to try grows, client activity, and so forth. And what we're finding now, it's because of the equity market step off in the interest rate environment, and we expect to be roughly at about a 25% EBIT growth from 2021 to 2022. I think a portion of that is the – is on the equity – is on the servicing fee line, a portion that is on the fee line that comes from the sweeps, remember that comes through the feeds as well. And then a portion is from on-balance sheet NII, and I don't have the pieces handy. But clearly, the interest rate tailwind is probably the more significant of those factors, and that'll affect both the on-balance sheet and the sweat deposits. And, Mike, it's Eric. Just on the synergies, I think each one of them has a cadence, some of which we did spell out I think on the cost synergies, which is the opportunity, and that's obviously sometimes will come out of there base of expenses, sometimes our base of expenses, as we put the two together. We had estimated about 40% of our cost synergies would come in, in year one, and then the balance, year two and three, and that's probably the single largest area. In terms of the the fee synergies, the balance sheet actions should come through relatively quickly. We can modulate the amount of swept versus on-balance sheet deposits, because we've got the capital resources plan for that. And I think that's one of the ways that we create real value./ And then the last one on the fee revenue synergies. Now some of the FX kind of markets, synergies come in a little more quickly, right, because it's about offering a broader set of, say, FX products on which were more capital intensive than simple swaps forwards, that is more about setting up clients, and then quickly being there for them. And then some of the servicing ones take a little longer and part of the sales cycle, but I think there's a good mix. And obviously, as we work on closing and bring Brown Brothers in, part of what we've been doing is, as you expect kicking the tires on what are the opportunities, how to go the next round of definition on those, so that we can hit the ground running. And as I said, when we announced the deals, we'd like to meet or exceed our targets. And I think the exogenous market, tailwinds are part of that, but we'd also like to do it on through old fashioned execution as well. It's – I wrestled, Mike, with that, because there were actually a series of tax benefits that came through this quarter, there was some closing of the previous year tax books, there were some foreign credits that accrue in those jurisdictions, which then help our GAAP taxes, and then there's some foreign credits that then kind of map back into the U.S. as a tax payments as deduction. So there's a series of them. I think the best way to do it is to probably take our full year tax rates are typically in the 17% to 19% range. So, you take the midpoint of that, think about full year this year now with this – with these discrete, which were more elevated than usual in a good way got us to closer to 15% tax rates. I think the difference is probably the – you might call the lumpy piece. What I do – what I would though also notice that I think tax planning has been the kind of thing that we've done for many years. We do it. We're always on the bright side of the line, and we do it carefully. We – part of it being an international bank. We, like other international banks, are able to do some a modest amount of tax planning. And so you'll see it, I think it's – we see that come through the P&L annually, it just tends to be a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter and it was a little more lumpy, good than usual this particular quarter. Sure. Thank you, Mike. Hey, Brian, it's Eric. I think you have a good estimate of those just for the broader group, I think we said about $5 billion to $10 billion are on the balance sheet today. About $65 billion are off-balance sheet and swept. And as we consummate the acquisition, and we're targeting the first quarter, we said it – at the end of the first quarter, we're targeting, we said it could be in the second quarters, this stuff just takes time. We'll – we're looking to bring on the $5 billion to $10 billion that they have on the balance sheet, and probably another 10ish or so, that is swept. I think over time, the question is really, at what interest rate levels do we operate at if we're at prevailing short rates of 50 basis points, let's say, then on balance sheet deposits aren't terribly attractive. But when you hit prevailing rates of 100 bps, or 200 bps, and obviously, you can do this across different currencies, then you're more inclined to bring more on balance sheet. And so we think of it as a range. I think we also, though, are quite – we want to be quite thoughtful about maintaining a program that, that works. It works well, for our clients, and the Brown Brothers Investment Services clients. It works well for a number of global financial institutions, that they have relationships with that they sweep, primarily dollar deposits to who appreciate those deposits. And so we certainly want to maintain the program for suites, want to maintain it in size. But you can certainly see swings of another $10 billion beyond the initial move potentially. But we're – I think we'll see when we get there. And part of it will be discussions with the clients themselves on one hand, and part of it will be the with the counterparties. And I think there'll be goodness and opportunity here in most circumstances. Sure, Brian, and it was actually a good opportunity as we see rates rise and the likelihood of Fed funds, but we did get a chance to go back and revisit what we both said and what we saw in from a deposit beta standpoint back in 2015, 2016, 2017. I do expect the Brown Brothers deposits behave similarly to ours. They are primarily with asset managers. They are currency by currency similar to ours. But if you go back, and I think we were good about disclosing our quarter-on-quarter interest-bearing deposit betas, and usually you have to do it by currency, right? So, because of how the betas play through. But in the first rate, the first one or two rate hikes, we saw and expect, again, to see deposit betas and, call it, 10% range, maybe 10% to 15% range, but it's quite low. When you get to the third, fourth or fifth hike, you're in the 30% range plus or minus some as you like into the rate cycle. And it's really, when you get in the past, they're in the fifth, sixth, seventh hike, where you're likely to get closer to 50% interest-bearing deposit betas. Now, I'd like to get there. I – we'd be pleased with with 50% if we get there with that level prevailing rates. But there's – I think there's a good opportunity here, because in truth, we've been quite limited in our ability to earn NII that covers our cost of capital. And so a lot of this is just catch up in a to a levels that are more in line with the long-term averages."

Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRon O’Hanley: Thank you, Ilene and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our Q3 results, which reflect continued strong performance across our enterprise. Before I discuss our third quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge our employees for their ongoing achievements in supporting our clients and generating the performance and momentum we are now seeing across the franchise. Thanks to their hard work and execution, we are now seeing measurable progress in our financial results even as we invest in our business for the future. We continue to successfully execute against our strategic objective of being an enterprise outsourced solutions provider across the front, middle, and back office and a leading asset manager. This is just the beginning. We are encouraged by the opportunities we see within our industry, our sales wins, the momentum in our pipeline, and what this means for our ability to drive future growth in 2022 and achieve our recently enhanced medium-term financial targets. We are encouraged by the trajectory of our organic profile as demonstrated by our year-to-date business wins. For example, on a year-to-date basis, we have delivered the strongest AUC/A wins in the company’s history, while AUC/A 1, but not yet installed stood at $2.7 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, our ETF franchise crossed $1 trillion of AUM this year with year-to-date SPDR flows on track for a record year and already surpassing the full year 2020 flows. Global Advisors financial performance continues to strengthen with pre-tax margin expanding to 36% in Q3. I also want to take a moment to note the intended acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services, which we announced in the third quarter. We are excited by the opportunities this transaction presents. It is a strong demonstration of our confidence in the industry, our investment servicing business, and our overall strategy. The transaction is also financially compelling as it will enhance State Street’s financial profile, and importantly it will create long-term value for our shareholders. From a strategic perspective, this combination will strengthen our competitive positioning and market leadership and deepen geographic coverage with State Street becoming the number one provider of asset servicing globally by assets under custody. Further, the accompanying talent will build on State Street’s already strong expertise and better position us for growth. The compelling nature of the deal has enabled us to raise our medium-term pre-tax margin targets. Turning to Slide 3, I will review our third quarter highlights. Third quarter EPS was $1.96, up 35% year-over-year. We delivered about 7 percentage points of positive operating leverage this quarter and generated a strong improvement in State Street’s third quarter pre-tax margin, which increased by about 5 percentage points year-over-year to over 29%. This year-over-year improvement was driven by solid fee revenue growth, good organic results, and higher NII supported by robust loan growth, leading to a strong total revenue performance. Meanwhile, our focus on expense discipline continued to drive earnings growth as expenses remain well contained. Relative to the year ago period, quarterly total fee revenue increased 9% as we delivered broad-based improvement across all fee revenue lines. Servicing and management fees increased 7% and 10% year-over-year respectively, and we delivered solid results within our markets businesses despite a continued moderation of FX market volatility. Even with 9% year-over-year total fee revenue growth, expenses were well controlled, increasing just 1% over the same period. Though expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items as our productivity improvements continued to yield results. AUC/A increased to a record $43.3 trillion at quarter end with new asset servicing wins increasing to $1.7 trillion for the quarter, including a large Alpha mandate with legal in general, which was announced in July. As a result, AUC/A 1, but not yet installed increased to $2.7 trillion at quarter end, as I noted a moment ago. Including the legal and general mandate, we reported three new Alpha client wins in the third quarter, making the total number of – taking the total number of Alpha clients to 18 at quarter end. At Charles River, annual recurring revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $239 million, and I am pleased with its business performance and how it continues to propel our Alpha strategy. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.9 trillion at quarter end and management fees increased to a record $526 million in the third quarter, benefiting from higher average equity market levels and continued inflows to our ETF franchise, where we continue to innovate. For example, in recent years, we have been expanding our actively managed ETF capabilities. And through three quarters this year, we have the most successful active ETF in the U.S. in terms of asset growth with the SPDR Blackstone senior loan ETF. By quarter end, this fund had gathered $5.5 billion inflows in 2021 and had AUM of $7.7 billion. We also made an addition to our actively managed fixed income ETF range in the third quarter for the launch of the SPDR Loomis sales opportunistic bond ETF. Turning to our balance sheet and capital, we completed a $1.9 billion common stock offering related to the proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services in the third quarter. Also related to the transaction, we suspended common share repurchases in the third quarter and currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of next year. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter. Capital return remains a key part of our medium-term targets and we recognized its importance to our shareholders. We believe that the BBH Investor Services acquisition is a financially compelling use of our capital and that it will deliver earnings accretion and value creation for our shareholders over time. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning everyone. I will begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4. We reported GAAP EPS of $1.96 or $2 excluding the impact of notable items. On the left panel of the slide, you can see that we delivered strong revenue growth year-over-year across every line item, controlled expenses. We delivered significant pre-tax margin expansion, all of which drove strong earnings growth. In fact, expenses were down year-on-year, excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation, which you can see at the bottom of the slide. This was another strong quarter where we are able to demonstrate the progress we are making in delivering on both our strategic priorities and our medium-term targets. Turning to Slide 5, you will see our business volume growth. Period end, AUC/A increased 18% year-on-year to a record $43.3 trillion. The year-on-year increase was largely driven by higher market levels, net new business growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 23% year-on-year to $3.9 trillion. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by higher market levels coupled with net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, both AUC/A and AUM were relatively flat given relatively stable domestic market levels. Turning to Slide 6, you can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Third quarter servicing fees increased 7% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels, good client activity and flows, and positive net new business. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about 1 percentage point of impact from some divestiture activity. On a sequential basis, servicing fees were flat as favorable equity markets and client activity were offset by about a percentage point of currency translation from the U.S. dollar appreciation. AUC/A wins totaled roughly $1.7 trillion in the third quarter, which gets us to a record of over $3 trillion of new AUC/A wins year-to-date. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in gross AUC/A wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition, normal pricing headwinds. And given the strong wins we have garnered year-to-date, we have already more than doubled that this year. At quarter end, AUC/A 1, but not yet installed amounted to $2.7 trillion. And I would also note that the unique Alpha value proposition represents a large proportion, which reflects our competitive strength as the only front to back office offering from a single provider. I will remind you that installations typically incur in phases and over time and deals will vary by fee and product mix. And as we have discussed previously, we would expect current one, but yet to be installed AUC/A to be converted over the coming 12 to 24-month time period with about half of the annualized revenue benefit through 2022 and about half in 2023. We continue to be pleased with our pipeline and our robust wins this quarter further showcases the broad-based geographic and multi-segment momentum of our business and will help drive net new business revenue growth in 2022. Turning to Slide 7, third quarter management fees reached a record $526 million, up 10% year-on-year and were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in a record investment management pre-tax margin of about 36%. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF flows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by the impact of the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers. Notably, we previously estimated that gross money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter. As a result of the recent improvement in short-end rates, we now expect they will be modestly lower at around $20 million in the fourth quarter, assuming current forward rates. Lastly, as you will recall, we have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises and we continue to have strong momentum and year-to-date results as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other important revenue – fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading services, we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes, which remained above pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. Relative to the third quarter of 2020, FX revenue increased 3% year-on-year, reflecting higher direct sales and trading revenue and indirect volumes, partially offset by lower FX volatility. FX revenue was down 2% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower client volumes and spreads. Moving to securities finance, third quarter fees increased 26% year-on-year mainly reflecting higher client securities loan balances and spreads as well as business wins and enhanced custody. On a sequential basis, fees were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances. Finally, third quarter software and processing fees increased 15% year-on-year, but were 8% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by CRD, which I will turn to next. Moving to Slide 9, I’d like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong standalone CRD results in the quarter, with a year-on-year revenue growth of 22%. We saw growth across all three categories of CRD revenues, on-premise, professional services and software enabled. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continued to grow nicely and were up 18% year-on-year. Record new quarterly bookings of $28 million and a healthy revenue backlog of $105 million also demonstrate the continued business momentum that we are seeing in CRD supported by the Alpha value proposition. On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the third quarter highlights from our State Street Alpha mandates. We reported 3 new Alpha mandates during the third quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception, through third quarter, we now have 7 of 18 total Alpha client mandates that are live. As a testament to our ongoing commitment and investment to further building out our Alpha value proposition, we have also acquired Mercatus, a premier front and middle office solutions and data management provider for private market managers. In connection with the acquisition, we launched Alpha for private markets, which will extend our end-to-end data platform offering for alternatives. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter NII increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher loan balances, growth in the investment portfolio and more deposits as well as the absence of the previously disclosed third quarter ‘20 true-up partially offset by lower investment portfolio yields due to the low rate environment. Relative to the second quarter, NII came in 4% higher primarily as a result of higher loan balances and a larger investment portfolio as well as higher short-term rates, all of which was partially offset by ongoing compression of yields. I would also note that we saw larger than usual slowdown in premium amortization in the quarter due to some tactical rotation of the MBS portfolio, which accounted for about a third of the sequential quarter improvement and something we wouldn’t expect to repeat in the fourth quarter. On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. Notably, total average deposits decreased by $9 billion in the third quarter or a decrease of roughly 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the active management of non-operational deposits. We also put more of our surplus balance sheet cash to work. We added approximately $3 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio. We also increased our average loan balances quarter-on-quarter to $32 billion in response to the good client demand. Turning to Slide 11, third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were flat year-over-year as productivity savings for the quarter continue to more than offset targeted business investments, typical expense headwinds, and $10 million to $20 million of higher than expected revenue-related quarterly costs. Compared to the third quarter of last year on a line item basis, excluding notables, compensation employee benefits was down 1%, driven by higher salary deferrals and lower headcount, partially offset by higher medical benefit cost as claims begin to normalize. Information Systems and Communications were up 3% due to continued investment in infrastructure and our technology estate, partially offset by our savings programs. Transaction processing was up 8%, primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses associated with sub-custody volumes and market data costs. Occupancy was down 6%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts. And other expenses were down 5%, primarily driven by lower asset management sub-advisory fees and the timing of some marketing costs. Relative to the second quarter, expenses excluding notable items were down primarily driven by the currency translation of the strong dollar and lower headcount. Overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline while driving high single-digit fee revenue growth year-over-year. When combined together, we delivered a solid pre-tax margin of nearly 30% and generated a robust operating leverage of about 7 percentage points year-over-year. Moving to Slide 12, on the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. As Ron mentioned earlier, to finance our proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Investment Services business, we completed a $1.9 billion common offering this quarter. Also in conjunction with the transaction, we did not repurchase any stock during the third quarter and intend to temporarily suspend repurchases before resuming them during the second quarter of 2022. Lastly, we still increased our quarterly dividend by 10% and returned a total of $179 million to shareholders in the third quarter in the form of dividends paid. To the left of this slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels with or without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements. As of the third quarter, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by roughly 230 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 13.5%. The improvement was primarily driven by the issuance of $1.9 billion of common stock related to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Investment Services and higher retained earnings. We also managed down our RWAs. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio also improved quarter-on-quarter by a little over 100 basis points to 6.3%, primarily driven by the issuance of the common stock, a decrease in the balance sheet size as we actively reduced some excess deposits and higher retained earnings. Post closing of the Brown Brothers Investment Services acquisition, we expect both capital ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges. Turning to Slide 13, in summary, I am pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates continued business momentum on our top line and productivity and engineering across our operating model. Total fee revenue was up 9% year-over-year, continuing the momentum we saw last quarter, reflecting growth in all businesses with management fees reaching a record level this quarter. Our expenses remained effectively flat excluding the impact of notable items as a result of our productivity efforts, notwithstanding higher revenue related costs mentioned earlier. As a result, we delivered about 7 percentage points of operating leverage year-on-year and we are able to drive pre-tax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced medium-term targets even in this low rate environment. Next, I’d like to update our outlook. With just one quarter left in the year, I would like to provide our current thinking regarding the full year outlook. At a macro level, our rate outlook broadly aligns to the current forward rate curve. We are also assuming global equity market levels will be flat to the third quarter average for the rest of the year as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility. In terms of the full year outlook, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 5% year-over-year, with servicing fees expected to be up 7.5% to 8.5% year-over-year. You will recall that at the beginning of the year, our guide was for total fee revenue to be flat to up 2%. So, this continues to be a meaningful increase over our earlier expectations. We increased this due to both higher equity markets and our net new business performance. Regarding NII, we had a small rebound in the short end market rates and some movement in the longer end of the curve as well. We now expect NII in the range of $475 million to $490 million next quarter, which is a meaningful improvement from the range we provided last quarter. This assumes rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to trend favorably though as I mentioned earlier, we would not expect the same episodic slowdown in amortization that we saw in the third quarter to repeat in 4Q. Turning to expenses, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs, while on-boarding new clients and investing in the business. Given the strong revenue performance this year and a healthy pipeline in front of us, we now see the need to both invest in our staff and in our business as well as covering some revenue-related costs. We thus expect full year expenses ex-notables to be up 1% to 1.25% year-over-year, which means a sequentially quarter increase into the fourth quarter. This is the equivalent of full year expenses being flat adjusted for the currency translation headwind and this would put us in a position to drive solid full year margin expansion and operating leverage in spite of the double-digit year-on-year decline in NII. On taxes, we now expect that full year 2021 tax rate will be towards the lower end of our range of 17% to 19%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRon O’Hanley: Thanks, Eric. To conclude our prepared remarks, we had a strong third quarter and continued to demonstrate measurable progress towards achieving our medium-term financial targets, including our recently increased pre-tax margin target. As we look ahead, we need to both appropriately recognize staff for a strong year and proactively invest in our business as we see growth accelerate. These strategic investments will include the Alpha platform and private markets expansion in particular as well as State Street Digital to drive future growth. As we stand here today and make these business investments for the next stage of growth, we have confidence that we will be able to do so while also delivering positive operating leverage and expanding our pre-tax margin each year through our medium-term horizon aided by the strong momentum we are seeing across our businesses. With that, operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe we can start with a question around asset management. I am not sure if you can answer, but I will give it a shot. So, we obviously continue to see market speculation surrounding strategic alternatives to SSGA. We have seen that in the past as well. Ron, you have been very vocal about sort of the secular changes in the asset management industry that are sort of supporting your growth strategy on the servicing fee side and a lot of that has just emphasized the scale. So, I guess with that in mind, do you think SSGA has enough scale to succeed in the marketplace today? And if there are sort of strategic alternatives that you are considering, do you need to remain a majority shareholder of any asset management kind of entity or if minority or a GB structure would make more sense, are the capital rules just too onerous and the obstacles too high to ultimately get anything done here?\nEric Aboaf: Well Alex, thanks and you have said a mouthful there. The – I mean I will begin this by saying that we like the business, and we particularly like our business. It is continued – its performance has continued to improve, and it’s now at least at average, if not above average in terms of the market and continues to grow in what are secularly growing areas, if you think about the ETF business, particularly fixed income ETFs etcetera. So, we think the business is – it’s an attractive business. It’s a business that helps us strategically from a portfolio perspective; and for many years now, it’s been a bit of a laboratory for us to test out different things that gives us an insight into the rest of the marketplace. So, our overriding goal would be to continue to participate in the business assuming that we continue to believe that we can improve performance. I am not going to comment on speculation other than say that it’s speculation. And if we have something to talk about, we will certainly come to you.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Fair enough. Eric, maybe one follow-up for you, just on the servicing fee side, obviously, a really nice momentum in terms of wins, but servicing fees are flattish quarter-over-quarter and even taking into account some of the [indiscernible]. So it sounds like a lot of it is just timing with next kind of 12 to 24 months. Hopefully, we will see the benefit of the revenues on the yet to be installed business. Can you help us frame and sort of size the revenue pool attached to the $2.7 trillion on yet to be installed? And then within that, maybe hit on the pricing dynamics as well. I think in your comments, you said the – you continue to see kind of normal pricing headwinds in the business. I think it’s been kind of in the 2% to 3% range long-term. Is that sort of the headwind we are still talking about or has that changed? Thanks.\nRon O’Hanley: Alex, let me – thanks for the question. Let me answer them maybe in reverse order. I think we continue to see the normalized pricing headwinds in the marketplace. We feel they are well controlled. We feel like they are understandable. They are logical. And that headwind is back down to about 2%, which is the historical norm. And a lot of that is how we go to market, how we engage with clients, how we now have added more feature functionality to our offering, Alpha is a big part of that of course and the duration of some of these deals will, I think, help reinforce that over time. We are very pleased, I think as you could expect with the wins this quarter, last quarter or the first quarter for that matter, and they are certainly in the range of the fee rates that we have for the company. We don’t – I think we don’t feel comfortable going into individual deals or individual quarters on that, but they are in that range that you see – that you broadly see on average and that gives us confidence that as this business get installed, it’s going to have a meaningful impact to revenues. We have been clear. We need about $1.5 trillion plus of AUC/A wins. We need that at current or around the fee rates that we have create the right amount of gross revenue wins as well, which then get implemented over time. So, that’s why we have put that benchmark out there. And what I would say is, while I think we have had until this year, a couple of lighter years in terms of sales, we need to continue the momentum we have been building. And part of the reason we referenced the pipeline is we feel comfortable with the pipeline and we see maybe not another $3.2 trillion of AUC/A wins, but at least substantial wins embedded in the pipeline for us to continue this momentum into next year.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Appreciate all of that. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Mr. Hawken, your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken: Sorry, I was on mute. Thanks for taking my question. I’d like to start maybe with BBH, could you talk about what you would expect the impact of that acquisition could do to your asset sensitivity and how the inclusion or pro forma balance sheet would be sensitive to a 100-basis-point shift in rates? And then also to help contextualize investors, Eric, you had discussed on the M&A call that the cost savings assumption is conservative, what’s a historical range for the right way to think about expenses for these types of deals? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Let me start on the deposit side and then we will leg into the other part of the P&L. And obviously, it’s early with Brown Brothers Investment Services. We are now – we have now gotten our regulatory filings in. We are obviously working through the closing process and with – are continuing to target a year end close. In terms of asset sensitivity, I think it’s a little early to model it too finely, but I think I would say is that the asset sensitivity of the book is probably in the range of what we have at State Street just because it’s similar asset management-oriented clients. They have similar expectations of deposits and deposit pricing, and I think you get similar betas and well similar betas and adjustments overall. I think what’s different, Brennan, and constructive here is because of the Brown Brothers bank sweep program, we have more flexibility than usual to either bring in deposits at attractive rates. And so that could, in a way, enhance our asset sensitivity though you have to be careful by the – you have to model that in or it could let us protect the size of the balance sheet and the leverage constraint – leverage ratio constraints that we have, which also led us adjust the amount of preferred securities that we need to run the business. So, I would say, overall, it’s probably in the same ballpark but with an ability through the rate cycle to either add deposits and NII or to manage leverage, and I think that’s a constructive program and a new functionality that they bring to us and one that will continue. In terms of the expense guide, I did say I was hopeful it’d be a bit on the conservative side. I think the expense guide was for a reduction of about 25%. So kind of, I think, on the lower end of what we’ve achieved before. I think – but it’s hard to compare to past deals to, I guess, too forcefully because every deal is different. We need to bring this business on, and I’ve said in the past, we’ve not always finished what we started and made sure that all the integration happens and all the functionality that we bring in from an acquisition gets fully integrated and created in our own offering. And I think that’s why it’s been at the lower end of our expense savings targets. But I think there is – we will see. I think it’s early. I think we will be – we will certainly give guidance as to some of those cost estimates in January, and we will certainly keep you posted. But we stand by the guidance. And as the see if I’m hopeful we can – we certainly want to meet those. And I always like to exceed where I can, but I think it’s a little early to lean too far.\nRon O’Hanley: Hey, Brennan, it’s Ron. What I would just add to that is we’ve emphasized about this acquisition. It is about capabilities and geographic reach and talent. So as we think about the synergies here, we’re thinking about them as combined synergies, if you will. I mean there is instances, where there is just some better capabilities that exist over at Brown Brothers.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thanks for all that color. And then for my second question, Ron, actually, Eric, when you provided the color on the fourth quarter expense expectation you made reference to some needs to invest and whatnot. I know it’s probably early. You’re probably just starting to work on the budget for 2022. But cost inflation is very much on the minds of investors. We hear about it broadly. One of your competitors at a recent conference raised the point that there would probably be some upward expense pressure in 2022. Should we begin to prepare for a bit of a lift? Is it appropriate maybe to use the fourth quarter as the jumping off point and then adjust for seasonality and then think about that into next year? Is there just some general guiding principles you could provide to help people level set on ‘22?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes. Brennan, let me start on that, okay? Because we are definitely seeing instances where there is some cost pressure, but it’d be untrue to say that it’s across the board. Certain types of employees for example, in the technology area, as you’d expect, because there, we’re not just competing with other customer banks, we’re competing with technology firms. So we are definitely seeing that. But we also continue to see productivity improvements in our business. We’re engineering them in. So we do see an ability to offset some, if not all that. And we’re just going to be careful about how we proceed forward. We don’t want to underinvest in key staff. But we also think that – I mean, as we see performance, we can pay for performance and do it through the incentive line. So it’s something we’re watching out for. And there are particular areas where we are seeing the need to raise the fixed cost of talent, but not at an overwhelming – we’re not seeing an overwhelming kind of thing yet. Eric, you probably want to add something.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Brennan, I’d add to that, you go through the line items of expenses. Ron covered the salary comp incentives. And obviously, we have a little pressure there, but we also have a little more attrition. I think everyone seen that as they – so we’re trying to – we need to net that out as we go into next year. I think you see a little bit of creep on the tech side. Obviously, some of those cost and transactional costs. But again, we have our engineering programs to offset some of that. And while it means there is more work to do. There is always more work to do. That’s just how it plays out. I think from a – if you step back and you say what are the guiding principles that we use as we go into our budget process, which is just really started and full swing in November and then comes through in December. Is really about how do we continue to make healthy or solid progress in expanding margin each year? How do we do that with a positive operating leverage? And you’ve heard me say before, we don’t like to live on the edge and be too hopeful of an equity market tailwind or something of that sort. And so I think you’ve got to think of it as commitment to progressing towards our medium-term targets and progressing at pace where we can make a progress each year. You’ve seen us notwithstanding the interest rate headwinds this year. We’re making progress this year towards those targets. We’re proud of that, and we need to feel like we need to continue that.\nBrennan Hawken: Thanks for all that color.\nOperator: Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nRon O’Hanley: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So two questions. One, I think on the expense side, one of the reasons why there are so many questions here is that there had been a period where State Street had a tougher time delivering positive operating leverage. And then more recently, you’ve had very good success. So when I hear the point about, hey, we’re going to be reinvesting a bit for future growth. I’m just wondering, is this a message we should take that the investment spend was a bit under – you underinvested over the past 1.5 years and now we’re going to ramp back up to \"normal\"? Or is this more of a temporary, we’ve got some things specific opportunities that we need to invest in. We can’t tell you how many quarters it’s going to take, but it’s more of a specific opportunity and the positive operating leverage we’ve been used to seeing recently will persist once we get through this period? I guess that’s part of the reason why there is so many questions on expenses. And if we could frame it like that, would there be any more color you could share with us. Thanks.\nRon O’Hanley: Betsy, it’s Ron. So we’ve been – we certainly have not been underinvesting in our business. And whether it’s inorganic or organic. I mean, obviously, as Charles River, more recently, Brown Brothers on an inorganic basis. But as we’ve tried to emphasize quarter-over-quarter, every time we’ve talked about us keeping expenses flat or even down. That’s been done by a fairly aggressive engineering effort to bring down BAU expenses, while also continuing to invest in the business particularly in the technology area. In terms of future investments, we just see the momentum building in areas where we’ve already started to invest and there is opportunity to invest more and accelerate growth. And the three areas that we highlighted were: one, just continuing to invest in Alpha and kind of bring more and more of that to market quicker. Second is private markets. And then third is the whole digital space where you’re seeing a lot of activity there, and that’s a combination of both supporting our clients in their digital kinds of ventures and also continuing to go to the next stage of digitization of our own business. So that’s what we’re talking about there. And again, I would underscore what I said at the end of my prepared remarks that we will do so with a commitment to positive operating leverage and continued margin expansion over the short to medium term.\nBetsy Graseck: That’s great color. And those three threads, those are top of our list too in terms of revenue generating growth potential over the next 3 to 5 years. So that seems like it makes a lot of sense to be investing for that. Maybe a little bit more quarterly-oriented kind of question. But just on the loan growth that you saw in the quarter, I just want to get a sense as to key drivers of that growth? And should we think that it was specific to this quarter? Or there is a demand there that we will likely see that kind of growth continue as we look into next year? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Betsy, it’s Eric. It’s a little bit of both, actually. We saw higher than usual opportunities this quarter. I think sequentially, our loan balances were up. They are talking $3 billion. That’s quite a bit on a $30 billion base of loans. We – a little bit of that was some discretionary lending we do, and then some of it was literally higher demand from private equity capital call financing, obviously, as the alternatives market continues to boom, some of our classic fund finance clients. We’re looking for some support and so forth. So I think it was a higher than usual quarterly print. I think year-on-year, what we’re seeing is some confidence that we can grow this loan book in the low double digits, which is nice. The one thing we are conscious of, though, is with loans comes RWA. And so what we’re always doing in background is optimizing the risk-weighted asset and the returns mix of those loans to make sure that in some cases, we add. In other cases, we sell fund by optimizing other positions, and that will be part of how we think about it going forward. But we do think of lending as an opportunity for us to drive NII in the coming quarters and years.\nBetsy Graseck: Thanks, Eric.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello. Good afternoon. I wonder if you could expand on the NII discussion. Just talk about what you think are non-operating excess deposits right now and how you think they behave as you have the model them behaving in a modestly rising world as we go into next year. Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yes, Glenn, it’s a really good and hard question, because there is not an easy answer to them. I think we clearly have, like others have had some amount of excess deposits flow in. What I would say, though, is if you go back, call it, 2 years, you can ask the question, is that the typical deposits and is all the increased excess. And I’d say that’s not true. What we’ve had over the last 2 years is very significant growth in our AUC/As. And with AUC/As, right, clients need to leave a certain amount of cash with us to handle the transaction volumes. And so a good bit of the increase that we’ve seen over the last couple of years is on the core deposit side. There is so some, as you’ve seen, that is excess. And we pulled off, I think, a reasonable amount this quarter. We don’t necessarily want to push down deposits too far because we do want to be there for our clients. If you go from – with that context to the, I think, the next part of your question, which is what happens in either tighter monetary policy with a slower expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet or rising rates. Does that reverse the course of deposits? I think it will eventually, but I think it will be a while. It will be a 2 to 3-year process reason for that to happen. And part of the reason I say that is the Fed continues even under a tapering to expand its balance sheet, right? They are just expanding it less is what the talk is all about. It’s not about actually stopping the expansion of its balance sheet. And so as the Fed continues to expand its balance sheet and then signal rising rates, I think we’re probably going to be in an environment of having healthy deposit levels, which effectively mean they are core, right, partly driven by the AUC/A need and partly driven by just the surplus of cash in the system and rising rates, which I think would be a positive – would be positive to certainly our balance sheet and NII and to the other banks as well.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. I wonder if you could just expand a little bit more on your thoughts. You mentioned private markets is one of the key growth areas. You’re one of the pioneers on the custody side of that. What does Mercatus do for you? And what can and can’t you do right now for the expanding world of private market? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. And private markets is a broad area, which is why I think we see some opportunities. If you recall, there is hedge fund activity in private markets. There is classic private equity. There is more fixed income kind of loan-oriented private markets. There is real estate. And so it’s in each of those areas where there is not one investment we need to make, but a series as we pick our spots and pick our spots not only across each of those products, but make some choices geographically as well. What Mercatus brings is a set of front-end functionality to the – that we can use to support our private other private market clients, so functionality around reporting to LPs, reporting to their own partnership. And that’s the front end that I think we value. And with that comes a set of data feeds and communication that’s quite valuable. And if you think about that, that is directly plugs into the historical custodial operation that we provide and why we’re so excited about it.\nRon O’Hanley: Hey, Glenn, what I would add to this that, that market is still largely an in-sourced market. So this isn’t about slugging it out with competitors and a race to the bottom on fees, that’s to be able to demonstrate a better offering than what these institutions are doing for themselves. The stakes are going up for them in terms of data reporting, particularly in ESG reporting. It’s not just that investors are demanding it, but in some cases, particularly outside the U.S. and Europe, you’re seeing reporting requirements being imposed not just on public companies but on private companies. And investors want to know what’s in their portfolio, including their private portfolio. So we think this is all going to be – and Mercatus helps us do that and this will all be further impetus to drive this to a more outsourced model.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you for all that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. Eric, I just want a couple of cleanups here. So you said that the premium was improved, but you called it episodic, but just wanted to make understand like what was that premium number in the third quarter so we can understand. I think you said it would continue to improve. So I just want to understand what the delta was this quarter.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. I think the best way to describe it, Ken, is remember, every quarter, we get some headwind from the compression in underlying yields in the portfolio. And what offsets that is less and less premium amortization, which comes through as a negative, but it’s a smaller negative each quarter. And this past quarter, I said about third of the $20 million improvement was from, I’ll describe as an excess reduction in premium amortization. And that’s the piece we don’t expect to repeat. We do, as I said, continue to expect some marginal headwinds in the underlying portfolio yields. We do expect some ongoing reduction in premium amortization, not just at that same level. And then we’ve also been pleased with some of what we’ve been able to do on the balance sheet asset size around lending and the investment portfolio. And that’s why we took our range up. But we’re a little conscious that the fourth quarter print we gave a range purposely. We don’t think the third quarter prints necessarily a perfect indicator of that. But all that said, I think we’re pleased with the direction that NII has taken over the last couple of quarters, and we think that sets us up for the future as well.\nKen Usdin: So do you have a number to give us versus the 157 in the second quarter?\nEric Aboaf: I think you’ll have to help me. I think in the second quarter, we had NII of 467 in the third quarter for 87. And I think the range I gave you was 475 to 490 for fourth quarter. That’s total NOI. I think what I’m trying to message is there are pieces below the surface, and we could get into a great amount of detail, but that’s kind of where the next falls out.\nKen Usdin: Okay. So on money market fee waivers, can you tell us what the money market fee waivers and asset management were in the third quarter?\nEric Aboaf: Sure. In the third quarter, the money market fee waivers were about $19 million. Back in the second quarter, they were close to $25 million. And that’s why we thought at current levels of front-end rates, which have stabilized, we said that fourth quarter is likely to be around the $19 million, $20 million that we just saw.\nKen Usdin: And what about the other fee waivers that were $21 million in the second quarter, do you have what that was in the third?\nEric Aboaf: I think we are focused – the biggest driver of money market fee waivers in our systems for GA, for our Global Advisors business, that’s the one we have spent the most time tracking I think is material. I think the – and dominates. So I think that’s the area to focus on.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Thanks a lot, Eric.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Hi, great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. First one is just on the asset servicing side, Eric, if you can maybe just sort of maybe give us a view on that step-up of asset servicing fee growth at legacy State Street, not including Brown Brothers in ‘22 and ‘23, given that the new wins have been so strong and you’re running at more than double the pace required to offset the pricing headwinds. So I mean, I guess the short question here is, should we expect a step-up in organic growth of asset servicing in ‘22 and again in 2023 given that pipeline? And not factoring in any kind of ignoring the market side of it.\nEric Aboaf: Brian, it’s Eric. I think it’s a little early to get out and start to forecast ‘22 and ‘23. I think what I was trying to signal is we’re very pleased with our sales performance this year. We’ve been able to book, and that clearly is going to be part of the components of delivering growth in ‘22 and ‘23. I would say we – and I’ve said this before, we need to earn our keep every quarter by continuing to drive sales and wins. And you saw that in the first quarter, we had $343 million of AUC/A wins. We’re very pleased with that. We’re pleased again with the second quarter with the third quarter. We need to keep at it because if you step back, remember, a portion of every year’s wins gets implemented in that particular year. It’s something like a third. About two-thirds of a year’s wins typically is – gets reported in the following calendar year. And then you still have some, it’s probably like a six in the year after that. So we are in a business where what we saw, we then start to implement and then we need to keep up that progress, and that’s what drives growth. And so I’d say we’re on a good trajectory. We’re pleased with this year’s successes and we’d like to continue to be successful. We expect to be given our pipeline, but it’s still early to forecast actual growth for next year and the year after.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. That’s fair enough. And then, Ron, just back on SSGA, obviously, you made a good case for the growth in that business longer term. But as you just think of strategically State Street as a whole, obviously, you’ve been the clear and away leader in the core asset servicing business. And your – you continue to enhance that lead with CRD and BBH and other investments for organically growing it. So as you think about State Street longer term, maybe would you prefer to be more of a pure-play on that leadership position or would you prefer to have the balance of the asset management business within that? And I guess also, is it really critical that you need SSGA for preferential capital treatment for going through the Fed’s stress test and CCAR?\nRon O’Hanley: Well, Brian, I mean, if you think about our portfolio of businesses, we are far and away the narrowest of both the U.S. and the total G-SIFI population. So we are pretty focused to begin with. And if you think about those two broad businesses, because I would put markets underneath our investment servicing business, because it’s really there to support that business, so if you think about those two businesses, they really are – they fall under that single purpose of helping institutional investors achieve better outcomes. So we start out from a position of being very focused. And then we ask ourselves all the time. First, are we satisfied with our performance and second, are we the right owner for these businesses? And at this point, as we look at it, we think and believe that given the performance, given the somewhat symbiotic relationship between two businesses that having this participation in that business is actually enhancing. And as you note, it’s certainly is helpful from a capital perspective and relative to our investment servicing and related activities, it’s a capital-light business. So when you add it all together, we like the business, but we recognize that you as shareholders can take care of diversification, and it’s not up to us to diversify for you. We have to make sure that as owners of these businesses that we’re good owners, and we can continue to grow the business, and we are looking at this all the time.\nBrian Bedell: That’s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.\nJim Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just on the security servicing side, outside of one-off large outflows like the BlackRock is. Can you speak to your efforts to reduced client attrition and kind of get that $1.5 trillion bogey of annual gross outflows down to really start to enhance the net growth from that side of the equation?\nEric Aboaf: Jim, it’s Eric. Let me start. There is a long history here in serving our clients, serving them well and being incredibly focused on what they need. And that’s what both create sales and sales opportunity because we’ve said over time, something like two-thirds, three-quarter of our sales come from our existing clients. And the other side of that coin is staying close to our clients when they are spending their needs, being there when they add funds or when they consider other options, is also a big part of what we do. Now sometimes our clients are involved in M&A, and we need to rebid what we’ve got. And so we have very active programs when that happens. And that’s part of the industry. We’ve got a set of client NPS, Net Promoter Score work that we do, that we’ve expanded over the last 2 years to now take on a very large portion of our clients. So that provides real-time feedback to us from the C-suite on down to the operational portions of our clients. And then it’s our coverage program. I think you saw us back in June describe how do you bridge with our Global Client division, our premium, our preferred and each one of them is geared towards making sure that we’re staying close and supporting our clients and making sure they are as satisfied and as can be. So, those are some of the elements, and I would say it’s deep in our culture and something we work on. That said, you have got to keep – if we want to grow and deliver core growth like we have done in the last few quarters, we have been able to drive core growth, which we are very pleased with. We have got to keep expanding and selling both to existing and to new clients. And you have seen us do that successfully. And then on the other side, we – I think we feel quite good about our retention rates and that will be – that’s always an area of intense effort and I would say this year has been successful as well.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. That’s helpful. And maybe just the second question on enhanced custody. If I look at the balance – if I am reading the balance sheet correctly, it seems like you have had very significant growth there. Is there any constraints on growing that business from a balance sheet perspective, capital perspective? How do we think about the – what’s driving the growth and the outlook for that over the next year or 2 years?\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Jim, it’s Eric again. I think for all of our balance sheet businesses, we always need to be careful about how much they consume in risk-weighted assets versus the earnings and the opportunities that they could provide us. We do that certainly on a standalone basis because you have got to look at every asset on the balance sheet, whether it’s lending asset for our loan book, for example, or securities finance business or enhanced custody business or FX business. And then you also have to think about it within the context of the client relationship because there is always a give and take and for a client that may not borrow very much, where they did do more securities finance for enhanced custody, that can be a reasonable mix and a way to serve them, but to serve them with decent returns. So, I would say there is certainly room in these businesses, but I think what we are doing is going into the end of the year as we close the Brown Brothers acquisition, we are being a bit disciplined about our risk-weighted asset position, right, because we want to close that deal, and we want to land within our capital ratios. And so I think while you have seen some very heavy growth in the last couple of quarters, just in the next one quarter to two quarters, I think you will see – you will continue to see some discipline. You have seen a little bit of that on the quarter-on-quarter balance sheet in some of the areas like securities finance. And you can imagine we will do that going into the beginning of next year. But what I would say is I think the franchise as we continue to grow the fee portion of the revenue base, manage our expenses, we can continue to put more capital to work over time, but sometimes there will be some ebbs and flows. And I think I have given you a little bit of an indication where we see some of those.\nJim Mitchell: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. So Eric, I wanted to start off just discussing some comments you made actually a bit ago at the BAB conference. You talked about the servicing fee growth algorithm and you framed it based on expectations around new store and same-store sales growth, pricing pressures, what have you. And I was hoping you can maybe just update us on how your thinking has evolved with regard to that algorithm, whether it’s strengthened just given the improved outcomes that we are seeing in terms of new business wins, at least relative to what you have seen historically?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, Steve, I think the algorithm that you are referring to that we have – that I have described and we have described as a company is that servicing fee growth comes from a mix of equity market tailwinds, client activity inflows, net new business, we can either be positive as it has been the last couple of quarters, neutral or negative and then pricing headwinds, right. It’s that four-part structure. I think the way I would update that is to say that the structure is still there and I think been fortified. I think the different areas move around a bit. I think equity market tailwinds, we have seen a very strong equity market tailwinds this year. I don’t think we are going to see that every year, but we would like to see flat to up equity market. So, you can imagine that part of the tailwind was very positive this year, which we are pleased with. And the way we monetize that is we didn’t take our expenses up with equity market uptick. The second one is client flows and activities. I think a couple of years back, this was a positive by a couple of points. I think a year or 2 years ago, as we saw outflows from packaged products in both – especially in the U.S. as mutual funds were on the wane and we saw less inflows in Europe. I think we felt less confident in client activity and flows of the tailwind. I think that’s actually rebounded nicely this year, and we expect that to continue given the current market dynamics. Net new business, as you referenced, I think we have got a strong year here in terms of wins. That will now start to get implemented next year and the year after. So, that takes time, but we are pleased with the backlog. And then pricing, I think as I have said, I think on the first question this morning has been well controlled and we just work on that intensely every day. So, I think the structure is intact. Every year will bring a little different mix and different elements of the – of that framework.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that color Eric. And just for my follow-up, I know you provided some helpful color on the BBH rate sensitivity, or additional flex from having the off-balance sheet suite option. I was just curious how the improving rate backdrop, just taking the forward curve, it informs your willingness to onboard more than the $10 billion of deposits, which you disclosed at the time of the deal and just speak to the relative attractiveness of on-boarding a larger percentage of deposits versus maybe other forms of capital return, like buybacks and dividend increase?\nEric Aboaf: Sure. And let me open up the aperture a little bit. Remember, the core of our capital constraint is around CET1, right, our common equity Tier 1 ratio, which is really a risk-weighted asset-based measure, not a leverage ratio measure. So, on the leverage ratio, we just need to be kind of within bounds. And so the decision on deposits and NII within reason is really around what rate levels we are sitting at. I think the way to think about the positives when prevailing short rates, call it, Fed funds is at the current levels, near zero, you are not incentive to have deposits on the balance sheet. That breakeven tends to flip at around two or three rate hikes, around 75 basis points of Fed funds. You start to be in a more neutral position and at 100 basis points of Fed funds you start to be the right way around or you would prefer the deposits on the balance sheet. And so it’s somewhere in that area, call it, two, three rate hikes from now, where we begin to seriously thinking about the benefit of adding more deposits instead of being – instead of holding them off. And so I think the question that we will – the decision criteria that we will get to is where are prevailing rates in the first quarter and the second quarter and the third quarter next year. And at that point, we will make some conscious decisions and trade off additional NII, which we would like to bring in, because it helps with our margin and our EPS. And we will just have to just be careful about the balance sheet size. But you have seen us manage the balance sheet side. You saw it this quarter. And in fact, it’s not like we – well, we know where to judiciously manage the balance sheet. And I think we will continue to do that while bringing on deposits and serving our clients as best as we can.\nSteven Chubak: That’s great color Eric. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Ron and good morning Eric.\nRon O’Hanley: Hi Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Eric can you share with us when you guys look at your asset under custody wins, can you break it out geographically? And also, are the wins coming from competitors, or are they coming from just companies that were doing it internally and now have chosen to go with somebody like yourself? And how do the numbers in this quarter look compared to the prior couple of years? Is there a shift going on in either of those two dynamics?\nRon O’Hanley: Gerard, maybe I will begin and Eric will add in color. If you look at this quarter, the standout, obviously, from an AUC/A was legal in general. So, mostly UK, but some – there is an American element to that also. In that case, it was for the most part, a new client to us. We did not have – we had a nominal existing relationship to it. And it’s an Alpha-driven mandate. So, lots of activities will be coming our way over time. If you look at the prior quarter, again, the standout there would have been Invesco, which was more of a U.S. based global client, where we had an existing relationship on the servicing side, we have – we are consolidating much of that and expanding into the middle and front office. So, I would say that what we have seen over the past couple of years in terms of the Alpha-related kinds of wins, it’s been nicely mixed geographically. And as importantly, it’s been – there has been more new client wins than we would have expected from the beginning. So, it’s enabled us to drive new client growth and what’s incumbent upon us then is to make sure that, obviously, if it’s a new client, there they have got the traditional servicing business with somebody else. So, what we are doing strategically is we will have the discussion on Alpha. We will win the Alpha and then say, now we want to move the servicing business over. In terms of the core wins, the – I would say that there has been a little bit of a cycle here and Eric will correct me if I am getting this wrong. But after – if you go back a couple – 3 years ago, EMEA was relatively light relative to the U.S., and we have seen actually over the past couple of years, a lot of activity in EMEA. And it’s not so much that it’s been less U.S. It’s just been more activity in EMEA. So, that had a lot to do with changing out and rebuilding a sales force and things like that, that had been done in the U.S., hadn’t quite been done until more recently in EMEA. So, it’s – what we like is it’s nicely mixed. And more recently, we are starting to see some activity in Asia Pacific, and we are really excited about Brown Brothers because of the truly leading position that they have in Japan that we will be able to leverage to support even more growth there.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Very good. And as a follow-up question and I apologize if you guys have addressed this already, in the revenue growth of servicing fees and management fees, 7% for servicing on a year-over-year basis, 10% for management. You have mentioned that client flows, new business growth, higher market levels contributed to this growth. How much of that growth was attributed to the higher market levels?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, it’s Eric. It varies by business. On servicing fees, a large proportion of the up 7% was driven by the equity markets tailwind, a smaller proportion from client flows and net new business. And then in the other direction, you have the usual smaller amount of pricing headwinds, and we also called out a little bit of divestiture activity. So, it’s kind of two-third, one-third, but what I think I am particularly pleased with is we are able to hold expenses flat, notwithstanding that. And that’s not been our history here as we have managed. On the management fee side, it was just the way that that business tends to be priced. The market tailwinds tend to come in and are a very important part of the tailwind. But we also had, I think, very nice net new business performance on the revenue side. You see it in flows. We also counted in revenues. But you saw there, us taking up our margin in the asset management business. And so while we are creating the environment for either an equity market tailwind or a flow tailwind in asset management, it’s the – we are also managing the other side of the P&L, and that’s been quite remunerative for us this quarter and pleasing.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you. And Eric, we all are looking forward to seeing you at the BancAnalysts Association of Boston Conference in about three weeks. So, we will see you then. Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: See you shortly.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.\nRob Wildhack: Good morning guys. Just one more on the expense side, you highlighted some productivity savings this quarter, and that’s been a trend recently. How much more is there left to do on the productivity side? And how much do you think that can continue to sort of offset any increases in other expenses going forward?\nRon O’Hanley: Rob, service productivity is hard work. And we have been at it now for a couple of years. And despite the progress that we see, we actually see more opportunities. It’s not as easy as just like in manufacturing just substitute a people-driven assembly line with a bunch of robots. It’s really activity-by-activity, substituting AI, substituting other kinds of automation, trying to eliminate reconciliations. And we are making progress against that, and we see the opportunity to do more. So, we see this as – it requires work, ongoing work and ongoing engineering, but we see opportunities over the next several years to continue to do more and more of this.\nEric Aboaf: And Rob, it’s Eric. I would just add as we adjust our outlook a little bit. Part of that was just year end incentives we need to reward really strong performance. But we also talked about starting to leg into investments. And we like to invest behind the revenue, not ahead of the revenue, but behind the revenue, and that’s what we are doing. One of those investments, to be honest, is engineering work, right, development work to actually automate processes, simplify processes and so forth. And so, part of what we are doing even into the fourth quarter is beginning some of that work so that several quarters from now, a year from now, 2 years from now, there is actually an engineering benefit. And so that’s where it comes together as well. But as Ron said, it takes real hard work and it gets done in phases.\nRob Wildhack: Got it. Thank you for that.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, Ron. Hi, Eric. A couple of questions for you folks on BBH acquisition, I remember you saying on the announcement of the call something about earn-outs. Can you talk a little bit about are these – is this additional payment over and above the purchase price, or is there something else for the partners who would have presumably gotten a part of that purchase price and cash that you are getting or can you give us some color on that. And what’s the driver of that? What is it tied to and over what time period?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, Vivek, so there is not an extra contingent payment here. So, let’s put that aside. But what we have put in place, and it was part of our – as we talked about expected accretion here. We have put in place an incentive plan that’s quite broad based. It’s – basically, it’s a success-based pool with the factors being client on-boarding and retention as well as staff retention. And everybody – well, all of senior management fairly deep into the BBH management participates in that. And there is targets out there in terms of client retention. There is targets out there in terms of desired staff retention. So, it was really meant to align BBH people around what we are aligned about, which is growing our client base and keeping our best talent.\nEric Aboaf: And Vivek, it’s Eric. You will see those costs in the acquisition restructuring line. So, we are purposely bounding it and – but including it in our financials. But they are modest. They are what you would expect us or any other acquirer to do in a deal. And given the combination, there is a real benefit in the execution here.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Great. Another one on BBH and Eric, maybe this is more for you, the BBH sweep program that you have mentioned previously too, how much of those deposits – how much of that sweep is at risk where banks not who are – who would not want to renew it because of capital constraints? So, how much of that would you need to take on? And if you couldn’t, what’s the alternative to that?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, Vivek, we – as part of our diligence, we looked at every part of this acquisition, how the revenues come together and there, there is a lot of share of wallet opportunity, expenses, how it comes together and certainly, the sweep program. The sweep program is modest when it comes to the bank counterparties. It’s not enormous for any one bank provider. I think the top 10 bank providers are important. But if you think about what swept away, I think we said about $60 billion, $70 billion is swept away today across 10 large banks. You are not talking about a real capacity constraint. And we did – we have done and we have actually engaged with each of those bank counterparties, most of whom we know extremely well and who we do business with, right. We often do business with those counterparties on the sub-custody side or in terms of other arrangements. And so there is kind of a – there is a bidirectional set of relationships that we have. So, we don’t see a lot of risk at this point and see more of an opportunity to actually sweep a little more, sweep a little less. What I would say is the core of the sweeps in U.S. dollar – and I don’t need to be patriotic to say that the U.S. dollar is an extremely valuable deposit and cash currency. And so that’s – so they are certainly valuable to U.S. and global banks. And so I think we have got a good program set up, and we see it continuing with some upside optionality for us.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. If you can provide more color on your phrase, business investment for the next phase of growth. That sounds like something more significant than simply tweaking budgets going into year-end or anything like that. So, when you talk about this next phase of growth, I know you talked about Alpha, private markets, the digital space, but if you maybe just give more color on the overall tech strategy and the tech budget. How much are you looking to increase the tech budget from where it is now? How much of that is to change the bank? And which areas of tech are you investing such as the cloud or other areas? Thanks.\nRon O’Hanley: Mike, it’s Ron. As I said earlier, we have been investing all along through this most recent period these last several years. And as Eric has noted, we have invested behind our revenue growth. So, the gates in our investment have not been necessarily opportunities, it’s been what can we do to fund this growth off of our BAU spending. And second, where and how is the growth coming in. In terms of what we are investing in, it really isn’t changing much other than from a balance perspective. I would say that much of the investment that you have seen over the past several years, if you think about the whole resilience area, the whole – I mean, this is imposed on all of us, resilience area, the cyber area would probably fall under the BAU or run the bank. Alpha has certainly been a change the bank kind of thing. And I think there is a – we would anticipate a little bit of a mix shift from run to change in terms of total amounts. But really, it’s not going to be a kind of peanut butter of thing where everybody gets a little something here for their pet project. It really is about those things where we see it positioning us for meaningful growth, meaningful additional growth. So, we explain why, but that would be Alpha private market and State Street Digital kind of primarily. What I would add to that, continuing to selectively invest in Global Advisors. I mean the investments we have made there in the past, particularly, for example, in the active ETF space, what we – the investments we made in European ETFs and a low-cost ETFs, all of which are growing, and we are gathering disproportionate share in those space. So, that’s how we think about it. I mean you shouldn’t expect us to be throwing a lot of money at things that we don’t know anything about or that are new to us, but it’s about things that we have already established can give us growth and that with a little more investment, we expect to be able to accelerate that growth.\nMike Mayo: Okay. So, spread around the peanut butter too much. But when you look at it by function, like I know you have – this predates you, Ron, but when you talk about the cloud or the back office and you talk about digitization, digitizing your operations, how are you looking at the cloud today in terms of public, private? How much of the workload has shifted? Where are you in that thought process? And how much does that play as part of your transformation?\nRon O’Hanley: I mean, Mike, we have been very active in the cloud, and we have, I think talked about this in other context. If you – I will use an example of what we are doing in Charles River and Alpha, which is an entirely right from the beginning when we said we were going to be open architecture and interoperable. That, by definition, meant that it had to be cloud-based. So, we have quite aggressively gone to the cloud. We have talked about our partnership, which was one of the first in this whole security services area with Microsoft and their Azure products. So, that is very much a part of it, and we think about it as being how can we – I mean, certainly there is a cost element to it is also how do we advance the business strategically and grow revenues.\nMike Mayo: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question is from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar.\nRajiv Bhatia: Good morning. Just one quick question from me, there are some headlines that hedge fund flows are pretty strong. So, can you comment on your alternative funds administration business? And what kind of growth are you seeing there?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes. Why don’t I begin and Eric will pick up, Rajiv. I mean you are right. Hedge fund floats have been strong and going back to Mike’s effort that would be another example of where we have invested fairly significantly in new technology there and in this case, using an outside provider. And we are enjoying the benefits of those flows. And I think that you will see – we expect to see more and more flows into alternatives, alternatives of all types. There is a further push to see this if you will, go into smaller, smaller accounts and the so-called democratization of it, and we want to be positioned for that.\nEric Aboaf: And Rajiv, it’s Eric. I will just add the private markets, the hedge funds are all attractive asset classes for us. And so year-on-year, we saw a 7% growth this year across the servicing fee franchise. In the private markets, you are seeing 2, 3 percentage point higher growth than the average for the company. And that’s one of the reasons why over the last year or 2 years and certainly going into the fourth quarter next year, we are investing more in private markets because we see those opportunities, and that adds to the growth trajectory of the company.\nRajiv Bhatia: Got it. Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to our presenters.\nRon O’Hanley: Well, thanks to all on the call for joining us. And we look forward to speaking with you further. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you again for joining us today. This does conclude today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ron O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our Q3 results, which reflect continued strong performance across our enterprise. Before I discuss our third quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge our employees for their ongoing achievements in supporting our clients and generating the performance and momentum we are now seeing across the franchise. Thanks to their hard work and execution, we are now seeing measurable progress in our financial results even as we invest in our business for the future. We continue to successfully execute against our strategic objective of being an enterprise outsourced solutions provider across the front, middle, and back office and a leading asset manager. This is just the beginning. We are encouraged by the opportunities we see within our industry, our sales wins, the momentum in our pipeline, and what this means for our ability to drive future growth in 2022 and achieve our recently enhanced medium-term financial targets. We are encouraged by the trajectory of our organic profile as demonstrated by our year-to-date business wins. For example, on a year-to-date basis, we have delivered the strongest AUC/A wins in the company's history, while AUC/A 1, but not yet installed stood at $2.7 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, our ETF franchise crossed $1 trillion of AUM this year with year-to-date SPDR flows on track for a record year and already surpassing the full year 2020 flows. Global Advisors financial performance continues to strengthen with pre-tax margin expanding to 36% in Q3. I also want to take a moment to note the intended acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services, which we announced in the third quarter. We are excited by the opportunities this transaction presents. It is a strong demonstration of our confidence in the industry, our investment servicing business, and our overall strategy. The transaction is also financially compelling as it will enhance State Street's financial profile, and importantly it will create long-term value for our shareholders. From a strategic perspective, this combination will strengthen our competitive positioning and market leadership and deepen geographic coverage with State Street becoming the number one provider of asset servicing globally by assets under custody. Further, the accompanying talent will build on State Street's already strong expertise and better position us for growth. The compelling nature of the deal has enabled us to raise our medium-term pre-tax margin targets. Turning to Slide 3, I will review our third quarter highlights. Third quarter EPS was $1.96, up 35% year-over-year. We delivered about 7 percentage points of positive operating leverage this quarter and generated a strong improvement in State Street's third quarter pre-tax margin, which increased by about 5 percentage points year-over-year to over 29%. This year-over-year improvement was driven by solid fee revenue growth, good organic results, and higher NII supported by robust loan growth, leading to a strong total revenue performance. Meanwhile, our focus on expense discipline continued to drive earnings growth as expenses remain well contained. Relative to the year ago period, quarterly total fee revenue increased 9% as we delivered broad-based improvement across all fee revenue lines. Servicing and management fees increased 7% and 10% year-over-year respectively, and we delivered solid results within our markets businesses despite a continued moderation of FX market volatility. Even with 9% year-over-year total fee revenue growth, expenses were well controlled, increasing just 1% over the same period. Though expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items as our productivity improvements continued to yield results. AUC/A increased to a record $43.3 trillion at quarter end with new asset servicing wins increasing to $1.7 trillion for the quarter, including a large Alpha mandate with legal in general, which was announced in July. As a result, AUC/A 1, but not yet installed increased to $2.7 trillion at quarter end, as I noted a moment ago. Including the legal and general mandate, we reported three new Alpha client wins in the third quarter, making the total number of – taking the total number of Alpha clients to 18 at quarter end. At Charles River, annual recurring revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $239 million, and I am pleased with its business performance and how it continues to propel our Alpha strategy. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.9 trillion at quarter end and management fees increased to a record $526 million in the third quarter, benefiting from higher average equity market levels and continued inflows to our ETF franchise, where we continue to innovate. For example, in recent years, we have been expanding our actively managed ETF capabilities. And through three quarters this year, we have the most successful active ETF in the U.S. in terms of asset growth with the SPDR Blackstone senior loan ETF. By quarter end, this fund had gathered $5.5 billion inflows in 2021 and had AUM of $7.7 billion. We also made an addition to our actively managed fixed income ETF range in the third quarter for the launch of the SPDR Loomis sales opportunistic bond ETF. Turning to our balance sheet and capital, we completed a $1.9 billion common stock offering related to the proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services in the third quarter. Also related to the transaction, we suspended common share repurchases in the third quarter and currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of next year. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter. Capital return remains a key part of our medium-term targets and we recognized its importance to our shareholders. We believe that the BBH Investor Services acquisition is a financially compelling use of our capital and that it will deliver earnings accretion and value creation for our shareholders over time. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Eric. To conclude our prepared remarks, we had a strong third quarter and continued to demonstrate measurable progress towards achieving our medium-term financial targets, including our recently increased pre-tax margin target. As we look ahead, we need to both appropriately recognize staff for a strong year and proactively invest in our business as we see growth accelerate. These strategic investments will include the Alpha platform and private markets expansion in particular as well as State Street Digital to drive future growth. As we stand here today and make these business investments for the next stage of growth, we have confidence that we will be able to do so while also delivering positive operating leverage and expanding our pre-tax margin each year through our medium-term horizon aided by the strong momentum we are seeing across our businesses. With that, operator, we can now open the call for questions. Alex, let me – thanks for the question. Let me answer them maybe in reverse order. I think we continue to see the normalized pricing headwinds in the marketplace. We feel they are well controlled. We feel like they are understandable. They are logical. And that headwind is back down to about 2%, which is the historical norm. And a lot of that is how we go to market, how we engage with clients, how we now have added more feature functionality to our offering, Alpha is a big part of that of course and the duration of some of these deals will, I think, help reinforce that over time. We are very pleased, I think as you could expect with the wins this quarter, last quarter or the first quarter for that matter, and they are certainly in the range of the fee rates that we have for the company. We don't – I think we don't feel comfortable going into individual deals or individual quarters on that, but they are in that range that you see – that you broadly see on average and that gives us confidence that as this business get installed, it's going to have a meaningful impact to revenues. We have been clear. We need about $1.5 trillion plus of AUC/A wins. We need that at current or around the fee rates that we have create the right amount of gross revenue wins as well, which then get implemented over time. So, that's why we have put that benchmark out there. And what I would say is, while I think we have had until this year, a couple of lighter years in terms of sales, we need to continue the momentum we have been building. And part of the reason we referenced the pipeline is we feel comfortable with the pipeline and we see maybe not another $3.2 trillion of AUC/A wins, but at least substantial wins embedded in the pipeline for us to continue this momentum into next year. Hey, Brennan, it's Ron. What I would just add to that is we've emphasized about this acquisition. It is about capabilities and geographic reach and talent. So as we think about the synergies here, we're thinking about them as combined synergies, if you will. I mean there is instances, where there is just some better capabilities that exist over at Brown Brothers. Yes. Brennan, let me start on that, okay? Because we are definitely seeing instances where there is some cost pressure, but it'd be untrue to say that it's across the board. Certain types of employees for example, in the technology area, as you'd expect, because there, we're not just competing with other customer banks, we're competing with technology firms. So we are definitely seeing that. But we also continue to see productivity improvements in our business. We're engineering them in. So we do see an ability to offset some, if not all that. And we're just going to be careful about how we proceed forward. We don't want to underinvest in key staff. But we also think that – I mean, as we see performance, we can pay for performance and do it through the incentive line. So it's something we're watching out for. And there are particular areas where we are seeing the need to raise the fixed cost of talent, but not at an overwhelming – we're not seeing an overwhelming kind of thing yet. Eric, you probably want to add something. Hi, Betsy. Betsy, it's Ron. So we've been – we certainly have not been underinvesting in our business. And whether it's inorganic or organic. I mean, obviously, as Charles River, more recently, Brown Brothers on an inorganic basis. But as we've tried to emphasize quarter-over-quarter, every time we've talked about us keeping expenses flat or even down. That's been done by a fairly aggressive engineering effort to bring down BAU expenses, while also continuing to invest in the business particularly in the technology area. In terms of future investments, we just see the momentum building in areas where we've already started to invest and there is opportunity to invest more and accelerate growth. And the three areas that we highlighted were: one, just continuing to invest in Alpha and kind of bring more and more of that to market quicker. Second is private markets. And then third is the whole digital space where you're seeing a lot of activity there, and that's a combination of both supporting our clients in their digital kinds of ventures and also continuing to go to the next stage of digitization of our own business. So that's what we're talking about there. And again, I would underscore what I said at the end of my prepared remarks that we will do so with a commitment to positive operating leverage and continued margin expansion over the short to medium term. Hey, Glenn, what I would add to this that, that market is still largely an in-sourced market. So this isn't about slugging it out with competitors and a race to the bottom on fees, that's to be able to demonstrate a better offering than what these institutions are doing for themselves. The stakes are going up for them in terms of data reporting, particularly in ESG reporting. It's not just that investors are demanding it, but in some cases, particularly outside the U.S. and Europe, you're seeing reporting requirements being imposed not just on public companies but on private companies. And investors want to know what's in their portfolio, including their private portfolio. So we think this is all going to be – and Mercatus helps us do that and this will all be further impetus to drive this to a more outsourced model. Well, Brian, I mean, if you think about our portfolio of businesses, we are far and away the narrowest of both the U.S. and the total G-SIFI population. So we are pretty focused to begin with. And if you think about those two broad businesses, because I would put markets underneath our investment servicing business, because it's really there to support that business, so if you think about those two businesses, they really are – they fall under that single purpose of helping institutional investors achieve better outcomes. So we start out from a position of being very focused. And then we ask ourselves all the time. First, are we satisfied with our performance and second, are we the right owner for these businesses? And at this point, as we look at it, we think and believe that given the performance, given the somewhat symbiotic relationship between two businesses that having this participation in that business is actually enhancing. And as you note, it's certainly is helpful from a capital perspective and relative to our investment servicing and related activities, it's a capital-light business. So when you add it all together, we like the business, but we recognize that you as shareholders can take care of diversification, and it's not up to us to diversify for you. We have to make sure that as owners of these businesses that we're good owners, and we can continue to grow the business, and we are looking at this all the time. Hi Gerard. Gerard, maybe I will begin and Eric will add in color. If you look at this quarter, the standout, obviously, from an AUC/A was legal in general. So, mostly UK, but some – there is an American element to that also. In that case, it was for the most part, a new client to us. We did not have – we had a nominal existing relationship to it. And it's an Alpha-driven mandate. So, lots of activities will be coming our way over time. If you look at the prior quarter, again, the standout there would have been Invesco, which was more of a U.S. based global client, where we had an existing relationship on the servicing side, we have – we are consolidating much of that and expanding into the middle and front office. So, I would say that what we have seen over the past couple of years in terms of the Alpha-related kinds of wins, it's been nicely mixed geographically. And as importantly, it's been – there has been more new client wins than we would have expected from the beginning. So, it's enabled us to drive new client growth and what's incumbent upon us then is to make sure that, obviously, if it's a new client, there they have got the traditional servicing business with somebody else. So, what we are doing strategically is we will have the discussion on Alpha. We will win the Alpha and then say, now we want to move the servicing business over. In terms of the core wins, the – I would say that there has been a little bit of a cycle here and Eric will correct me if I am getting this wrong. But after – if you go back a couple – 3 years ago, EMEA was relatively light relative to the U.S., and we have seen actually over the past couple of years, a lot of activity in EMEA. And it's not so much that it's been less U.S. It's just been more activity in EMEA. So, that had a lot to do with changing out and rebuilding a sales force and things like that, that had been done in the U.S., hadn't quite been done until more recently in EMEA. So, it's – what we like is it's nicely mixed. And more recently, we are starting to see some activity in Asia Pacific, and we are really excited about Brown Brothers because of the truly leading position that they have in Japan that we will be able to leverage to support even more growth there. Rob, service productivity is hard work. And we have been at it now for a couple of years. And despite the progress that we see, we actually see more opportunities. It's not as easy as just like in manufacturing just substitute a people-driven assembly line with a bunch of robots. It's really activity-by-activity, substituting AI, substituting other kinds of automation, trying to eliminate reconciliations. And we are making progress against that, and we see the opportunity to do more. So, we see this as – it requires work, ongoing work and ongoing engineering, but we see opportunities over the next several years to continue to do more and more of this. Yes, Vivek, so there is not an extra contingent payment here. So, let's put that aside. But what we have put in place, and it was part of our – as we talked about expected accretion here. We have put in place an incentive plan that's quite broad based. It's – basically, it's a success-based pool with the factors being client on-boarding and retention as well as staff retention. And everybody – well, all of senior management fairly deep into the BBH management participates in that. And there is targets out there in terms of client retention. There is targets out there in terms of desired staff retention. So, it was really meant to align BBH people around what we are aligned about, which is growing our client base and keeping our best talent. Mike, it's Ron. As I said earlier, we have been investing all along through this most recent period these last several years. And as Eric has noted, we have invested behind our revenue growth. So, the gates in our investment have not been necessarily opportunities, it's been what can we do to fund this growth off of our BAU spending. And second, where and how is the growth coming in. In terms of what we are investing in, it really isn't changing much other than from a balance perspective. I would say that much of the investment that you have seen over the past several years, if you think about the whole resilience area, the whole – I mean, this is imposed on all of us, resilience area, the cyber area would probably fall under the BAU or run the bank. Alpha has certainly been a change the bank kind of thing. And I think there is a – we would anticipate a little bit of a mix shift from run to change in terms of total amounts. But really, it's not going to be a kind of peanut butter of thing where everybody gets a little something here for their pet project. It really is about those things where we see it positioning us for meaningful growth, meaningful additional growth. So, we explain why, but that would be Alpha private market and State Street Digital kind of primarily. What I would add to that, continuing to selectively invest in Global Advisors. I mean the investments we have made there in the past, particularly, for example, in the active ETF space, what we – the investments we made in European ETFs and a low-cost ETFs, all of which are growing, and we are gathering disproportionate share in those space. So, that's how we think about it. I mean you shouldn't expect us to be throwing a lot of money at things that we don't know anything about or that are new to us, but it's about things that we have already established can give us growth and that with a little more investment, we expect to be able to accelerate that growth. I mean, Mike, we have been very active in the cloud, and we have, I think talked about this in other context. If you – I will use an example of what we are doing in Charles River and Alpha, which is an entirely right from the beginning when we said we were going to be open architecture and interoperable. That, by definition, meant that it had to be cloud-based. So, we have quite aggressively gone to the cloud. We have talked about our partnership, which was one of the first in this whole security services area with Microsoft and their Azure products. So, that is very much a part of it, and we think about it as being how can we – I mean, certainly there is a cost element to it is also how do we advance the business strategically and grow revenues. Yes. Why don't I begin and Eric will pick up, Rajiv. I mean you are right. Hedge fund floats have been strong and going back to Mike's effort that would be another example of where we have invested fairly significantly in new technology there and in this case, using an outside provider. And we are enjoying the benefits of those flows. And I think that you will see – we expect to see more and more flows into alternatives, alternatives of all types. There is a further push to see this if you will, go into smaller, smaller accounts and the so-called democratization of it, and we want to be positioned for that. Well, thanks to all on the call for joining us. And we look forward to speaking with you further. Thanks very much."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning everyone. I will begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4. We reported GAAP EPS of $1.96 or $2 excluding the impact of notable items. On the left panel of the slide, you can see that we delivered strong revenue growth year-over-year across every line item, controlled expenses. We delivered significant pre-tax margin expansion, all of which drove strong earnings growth. In fact, expenses were down year-on-year, excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation, which you can see at the bottom of the slide. This was another strong quarter where we are able to demonstrate the progress we are making in delivering on both our strategic priorities and our medium-term targets. Turning to Slide 5, you will see our business volume growth. Period end, AUC/A increased 18% year-on-year to a record $43.3 trillion. The year-on-year increase was largely driven by higher market levels, net new business growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 23% year-on-year to $3.9 trillion. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by higher market levels coupled with net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, both AUC/A and AUM were relatively flat given relatively stable domestic market levels. Turning to Slide 6, you can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Third quarter servicing fees increased 7% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels, good client activity and flows, and positive net new business. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about 1 percentage point of impact from some divestiture activity. On a sequential basis, servicing fees were flat as favorable equity markets and client activity were offset by about a percentage point of currency translation from the U.S. dollar appreciation. AUC/A wins totaled roughly $1.7 trillion in the third quarter, which gets us to a record of over $3 trillion of new AUC/A wins year-to-date. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in gross AUC/A wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition, normal pricing headwinds. And given the strong wins we have garnered year-to-date, we have already more than doubled that this year. At quarter end, AUC/A 1, but not yet installed amounted to $2.7 trillion. And I would also note that the unique Alpha value proposition represents a large proportion, which reflects our competitive strength as the only front to back office offering from a single provider. I will remind you that installations typically incur in phases and over time and deals will vary by fee and product mix. And as we have discussed previously, we would expect current one, but yet to be installed AUC/A to be converted over the coming 12 to 24-month time period with about half of the annualized revenue benefit through 2022 and about half in 2023. We continue to be pleased with our pipeline and our robust wins this quarter further showcases the broad-based geographic and multi-segment momentum of our business and will help drive net new business revenue growth in 2022. Turning to Slide 7, third quarter management fees reached a record $526 million, up 10% year-on-year and were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in a record investment management pre-tax margin of about 36%. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF flows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by the impact of the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers. Notably, we previously estimated that gross money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter. As a result of the recent improvement in short-end rates, we now expect they will be modestly lower at around $20 million in the fourth quarter, assuming current forward rates. Lastly, as you will recall, we have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises and we continue to have strong momentum and year-to-date results as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other important revenue – fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading services, we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes, which remained above pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. Relative to the third quarter of 2020, FX revenue increased 3% year-on-year, reflecting higher direct sales and trading revenue and indirect volumes, partially offset by lower FX volatility. FX revenue was down 2% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower client volumes and spreads. Moving to securities finance, third quarter fees increased 26% year-on-year mainly reflecting higher client securities loan balances and spreads as well as business wins and enhanced custody. On a sequential basis, fees were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances. Finally, third quarter software and processing fees increased 15% year-on-year, but were 8% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by CRD, which I will turn to next. Moving to Slide 9, I'd like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong standalone CRD results in the quarter, with a year-on-year revenue growth of 22%. We saw growth across all three categories of CRD revenues, on-premise, professional services and software enabled. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continued to grow nicely and were up 18% year-on-year. Record new quarterly bookings of $28 million and a healthy revenue backlog of $105 million also demonstrate the continued business momentum that we are seeing in CRD supported by the Alpha value proposition. On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the third quarter highlights from our State Street Alpha mandates. We reported 3 new Alpha mandates during the third quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception, through third quarter, we now have 7 of 18 total Alpha client mandates that are live. As a testament to our ongoing commitment and investment to further building out our Alpha value proposition, we have also acquired Mercatus, a premier front and middle office solutions and data management provider for private market managers. In connection with the acquisition, we launched Alpha for private markets, which will extend our end-to-end data platform offering for alternatives. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter NII increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher loan balances, growth in the investment portfolio and more deposits as well as the absence of the previously disclosed third quarter ‘20 true-up partially offset by lower investment portfolio yields due to the low rate environment. Relative to the second quarter, NII came in 4% higher primarily as a result of higher loan balances and a larger investment portfolio as well as higher short-term rates, all of which was partially offset by ongoing compression of yields. I would also note that we saw larger than usual slowdown in premium amortization in the quarter due to some tactical rotation of the MBS portfolio, which accounted for about a third of the sequential quarter improvement and something we wouldn't expect to repeat in the fourth quarter. On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. Notably, total average deposits decreased by $9 billion in the third quarter or a decrease of roughly 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the active management of non-operational deposits. We also put more of our surplus balance sheet cash to work. We added approximately $3 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio. We also increased our average loan balances quarter-on-quarter to $32 billion in response to the good client demand. Turning to Slide 11, third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were flat year-over-year as productivity savings for the quarter continue to more than offset targeted business investments, typical expense headwinds, and $10 million to $20 million of higher than expected revenue-related quarterly costs. Compared to the third quarter of last year on a line item basis, excluding notables, compensation employee benefits was down 1%, driven by higher salary deferrals and lower headcount, partially offset by higher medical benefit cost as claims begin to normalize. Information Systems and Communications were up 3% due to continued investment in infrastructure and our technology estate, partially offset by our savings programs. Transaction processing was up 8%, primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses associated with sub-custody volumes and market data costs. Occupancy was down 6%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts. And other expenses were down 5%, primarily driven by lower asset management sub-advisory fees and the timing of some marketing costs. Relative to the second quarter, expenses excluding notable items were down primarily driven by the currency translation of the strong dollar and lower headcount. Overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline while driving high single-digit fee revenue growth year-over-year. When combined together, we delivered a solid pre-tax margin of nearly 30% and generated a robust operating leverage of about 7 percentage points year-over-year. Moving to Slide 12, on the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. As Ron mentioned earlier, to finance our proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Investment Services business, we completed a $1.9 billion common offering this quarter. Also in conjunction with the transaction, we did not repurchase any stock during the third quarter and intend to temporarily suspend repurchases before resuming them during the second quarter of 2022. Lastly, we still increased our quarterly dividend by 10% and returned a total of $179 million to shareholders in the third quarter in the form of dividends paid. To the left of this slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels with or without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements. As of the third quarter, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by roughly 230 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 13.5%. The improvement was primarily driven by the issuance of $1.9 billion of common stock related to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Investment Services and higher retained earnings. We also managed down our RWAs. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio also improved quarter-on-quarter by a little over 100 basis points to 6.3%, primarily driven by the issuance of the common stock, a decrease in the balance sheet size as we actively reduced some excess deposits and higher retained earnings. Post closing of the Brown Brothers Investment Services acquisition, we expect both capital ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges. Turning to Slide 13, in summary, I am pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates continued business momentum on our top line and productivity and engineering across our operating model. Total fee revenue was up 9% year-over-year, continuing the momentum we saw last quarter, reflecting growth in all businesses with management fees reaching a record level this quarter. Our expenses remained effectively flat excluding the impact of notable items as a result of our productivity efforts, notwithstanding higher revenue related costs mentioned earlier. As a result, we delivered about 7 percentage points of operating leverage year-on-year and we are able to drive pre-tax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced medium-term targets even in this low rate environment. Next, I'd like to update our outlook. With just one quarter left in the year, I would like to provide our current thinking regarding the full year outlook. At a macro level, our rate outlook broadly aligns to the current forward rate curve. We are also assuming global equity market levels will be flat to the third quarter average for the rest of the year as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility. In terms of the full year outlook, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 5% year-over-year, with servicing fees expected to be up 7.5% to 8.5% year-over-year. You will recall that at the beginning of the year, our guide was for total fee revenue to be flat to up 2%. So, this continues to be a meaningful increase over our earlier expectations. We increased this due to both higher equity markets and our net new business performance. Regarding NII, we had a small rebound in the short end market rates and some movement in the longer end of the curve as well. We now expect NII in the range of $475 million to $490 million next quarter, which is a meaningful improvement from the range we provided last quarter. This assumes rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to trend favorably though as I mentioned earlier, we would not expect the same episodic slowdown in amortization that we saw in the third quarter to repeat in 4Q. Turning to expenses, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs, while on-boarding new clients and investing in the business. Given the strong revenue performance this year and a healthy pipeline in front of us, we now see the need to both invest in our staff and in our business as well as covering some revenue-related costs. We thus expect full year expenses ex-notables to be up 1% to 1.25% year-over-year, which means a sequentially quarter increase into the fourth quarter. This is the equivalent of full year expenses being flat adjusted for the currency translation headwind and this would put us in a position to drive solid full year margin expansion and operating leverage in spite of the double-digit year-on-year decline in NII. On taxes, we now expect that full year 2021 tax rate will be towards the lower end of our range of 17% to 19%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Well Alex, thanks and you have said a mouthful there. The – I mean I will begin this by saying that we like the business, and we particularly like our business. It is continued – its performance has continued to improve, and it's now at least at average, if not above average in terms of the market and continues to grow in what are secularly growing areas, if you think about the ETF business, particularly fixed income ETFs etcetera. So, we think the business is – it's an attractive business. It's a business that helps us strategically from a portfolio perspective; and for many years now, it's been a bit of a laboratory for us to test out different things that gives us an insight into the rest of the marketplace. So, our overriding goal would be to continue to participate in the business assuming that we continue to believe that we can improve performance. I am not going to comment on speculation other than say that it's speculation. And if we have something to talk about, we will certainly come to you. Sure. Let me start on the deposit side and then we will leg into the other part of the P&L. And obviously, it's early with Brown Brothers Investment Services. We are now – we have now gotten our regulatory filings in. We are obviously working through the closing process and with – are continuing to target a year end close. In terms of asset sensitivity, I think it's a little early to model it too finely, but I think I would say is that the asset sensitivity of the book is probably in the range of what we have at State Street just because it's similar asset management-oriented clients. They have similar expectations of deposits and deposit pricing, and I think you get similar betas and well similar betas and adjustments overall. I think what's different, Brennan, and constructive here is because of the Brown Brothers bank sweep program, we have more flexibility than usual to either bring in deposits at attractive rates. And so that could, in a way, enhance our asset sensitivity though you have to be careful by the – you have to model that in or it could let us protect the size of the balance sheet and the leverage constraint – leverage ratio constraints that we have, which also led us adjust the amount of preferred securities that we need to run the business. So, I would say, overall, it's probably in the same ballpark but with an ability through the rate cycle to either add deposits and NII or to manage leverage, and I think that's a constructive program and a new functionality that they bring to us and one that will continue. In terms of the expense guide, I did say I was hopeful it'd be a bit on the conservative side. I think the expense guide was for a reduction of about 25%. So kind of, I think, on the lower end of what we've achieved before. I think – but it's hard to compare to past deals to, I guess, too forcefully because every deal is different. We need to bring this business on, and I've said in the past, we've not always finished what we started and made sure that all the integration happens and all the functionality that we bring in from an acquisition gets fully integrated and created in our own offering. And I think that's why it's been at the lower end of our expense savings targets. But I think there is – we will see. I think it's early. I think we will be – we will certainly give guidance as to some of those cost estimates in January, and we will certainly keep you posted. But we stand by the guidance. And as the see if I'm hopeful we can – we certainly want to meet those. And I always like to exceed where I can, but I think it's a little early to lean too far. Yes. Brennan, I'd add to that, you go through the line items of expenses. Ron covered the salary comp incentives. And obviously, we have a little pressure there, but we also have a little more attrition. I think everyone seen that as they – so we're trying to – we need to net that out as we go into next year. I think you see a little bit of creep on the tech side. Obviously, some of those cost and transactional costs. But again, we have our engineering programs to offset some of that. And while it means there is more work to do. There is always more work to do. That's just how it plays out. I think from a – if you step back and you say what are the guiding principles that we use as we go into our budget process, which is just really started and full swing in November and then comes through in December. Is really about how do we continue to make healthy or solid progress in expanding margin each year? How do we do that with a positive operating leverage? And you've heard me say before, we don't like to live on the edge and be too hopeful of an equity market tailwind or something of that sort. And so I think you've got to think of it as commitment to progressing towards our medium-term targets and progressing at pace where we can make a progress each year. You've seen us notwithstanding the interest rate headwinds this year. We're making progress this year towards those targets. We're proud of that, and we need to feel like we need to continue that. Betsy, it's Eric. It's a little bit of both, actually. We saw higher than usual opportunities this quarter. I think sequentially, our loan balances were up. They are talking $3 billion. That's quite a bit on a $30 billion base of loans. We – a little bit of that was some discretionary lending we do, and then some of it was literally higher demand from private equity capital call financing, obviously, as the alternatives market continues to boom, some of our classic fund finance clients. We're looking for some support and so forth. So I think it was a higher than usual quarterly print. I think year-on-year, what we're seeing is some confidence that we can grow this loan book in the low double digits, which is nice. The one thing we are conscious of, though, is with loans comes RWA. And so what we're always doing in background is optimizing the risk-weighted asset and the returns mix of those loans to make sure that in some cases, we add. In other cases, we sell fund by optimizing other positions, and that will be part of how we think about it going forward. But we do think of lending as an opportunity for us to drive NII in the coming quarters and years. Sure. Yes, Glenn, it's a really good and hard question, because there is not an easy answer to them. I think we clearly have, like others have had some amount of excess deposits flow in. What I would say, though, is if you go back, call it, 2 years, you can ask the question, is that the typical deposits and is all the increased excess. And I'd say that's not true. What we've had over the last 2 years is very significant growth in our AUC/As. And with AUC/As, right, clients need to leave a certain amount of cash with us to handle the transaction volumes. And so a good bit of the increase that we've seen over the last couple of years is on the core deposit side. There is so some, as you've seen, that is excess. And we pulled off, I think, a reasonable amount this quarter. We don't necessarily want to push down deposits too far because we do want to be there for our clients. If you go from – with that context to the, I think, the next part of your question, which is what happens in either tighter monetary policy with a slower expansion of the Fed's balance sheet or rising rates. Does that reverse the course of deposits? I think it will eventually, but I think it will be a while. It will be a 2 to 3-year process reason for that to happen. And part of the reason I say that is the Fed continues even under a tapering to expand its balance sheet, right? They are just expanding it less is what the talk is all about. It's not about actually stopping the expansion of its balance sheet. And so as the Fed continues to expand its balance sheet and then signal rising rates, I think we're probably going to be in an environment of having healthy deposit levels, which effectively mean they are core, right, partly driven by the AUC/A need and partly driven by just the surplus of cash in the system and rising rates, which I think would be a positive – would be positive to certainly our balance sheet and NII and to the other banks as well. Yes. And private markets is a broad area, which is why I think we see some opportunities. If you recall, there is hedge fund activity in private markets. There is classic private equity. There is more fixed income kind of loan-oriented private markets. There is real estate. And so it's in each of those areas where there is not one investment we need to make, but a series as we pick our spots and pick our spots not only across each of those products, but make some choices geographically as well. What Mercatus brings is a set of front-end functionality to the – that we can use to support our private other private market clients, so functionality around reporting to LPs, reporting to their own partnership. And that's the front end that I think we value. And with that comes a set of data feeds and communication that's quite valuable. And if you think about that, that is directly plugs into the historical custodial operation that we provide and why we're so excited about it. Yes. I think the best way to describe it, Ken, is remember, every quarter, we get some headwind from the compression in underlying yields in the portfolio. And what offsets that is less and less premium amortization, which comes through as a negative, but it's a smaller negative each quarter. And this past quarter, I said about third of the $20 million improvement was from, I'll describe as an excess reduction in premium amortization. And that's the piece we don't expect to repeat. We do, as I said, continue to expect some marginal headwinds in the underlying portfolio yields. We do expect some ongoing reduction in premium amortization, not just at that same level. And then we've also been pleased with some of what we've been able to do on the balance sheet asset size around lending and the investment portfolio. And that's why we took our range up. But we're a little conscious that the fourth quarter print we gave a range purposely. We don't think the third quarter prints necessarily a perfect indicator of that. But all that said, I think we're pleased with the direction that NII has taken over the last couple of quarters, and we think that sets us up for the future as well. I think you'll have to help me. I think in the second quarter, we had NII of 467 in the third quarter for 87. And I think the range I gave you was 475 to 490 for fourth quarter. That's total NOI. I think what I'm trying to message is there are pieces below the surface, and we could get into a great amount of detail, but that's kind of where the next falls out. Sure. In the third quarter, the money market fee waivers were about $19 million. Back in the second quarter, they were close to $25 million. And that's why we thought at current levels of front-end rates, which have stabilized, we said that fourth quarter is likely to be around the $19 million, $20 million that we just saw. I think we are focused – the biggest driver of money market fee waivers in our systems for GA, for our Global Advisors business, that's the one we have spent the most time tracking I think is material. I think the – and dominates. So I think that's the area to focus on. Sure. Brian, it's Eric. I think it's a little early to get out and start to forecast ‘22 and ‘23. I think what I was trying to signal is we're very pleased with our sales performance this year. We've been able to book, and that clearly is going to be part of the components of delivering growth in ‘22 and ‘23. I would say we – and I've said this before, we need to earn our keep every quarter by continuing to drive sales and wins. And you saw that in the first quarter, we had $343 million of AUC/A wins. We're very pleased with that. We're pleased again with the second quarter with the third quarter. We need to keep at it because if you step back, remember, a portion of every year's wins gets implemented in that particular year. It's something like a third. About two-thirds of a year's wins typically is – gets reported in the following calendar year. And then you still have some, it's probably like a six in the year after that. So we are in a business where what we saw, we then start to implement and then we need to keep up that progress, and that's what drives growth. And so I'd say we're on a good trajectory. We're pleased with this year's successes and we'd like to continue to be successful. We expect to be given our pipeline, but it's still early to forecast actual growth for next year and the year after. Jim, it's Eric. Let me start. There is a long history here in serving our clients, serving them well and being incredibly focused on what they need. And that's what both create sales and sales opportunity because we've said over time, something like two-thirds, three-quarter of our sales come from our existing clients. And the other side of that coin is staying close to our clients when they are spending their needs, being there when they add funds or when they consider other options, is also a big part of what we do. Now sometimes our clients are involved in M&A, and we need to rebid what we've got. And so we have very active programs when that happens. And that's part of the industry. We've got a set of client NPS, Net Promoter Score work that we do, that we've expanded over the last 2 years to now take on a very large portion of our clients. So that provides real-time feedback to us from the C-suite on down to the operational portions of our clients. And then it's our coverage program. I think you saw us back in June describe how do you bridge with our Global Client division, our premium, our preferred and each one of them is geared towards making sure that we're staying close and supporting our clients and making sure they are as satisfied and as can be. So, those are some of the elements, and I would say it's deep in our culture and something we work on. That said, you have got to keep – if we want to grow and deliver core growth like we have done in the last few quarters, we have been able to drive core growth, which we are very pleased with. We have got to keep expanding and selling both to existing and to new clients. And you have seen us do that successfully. And then on the other side, we – I think we feel quite good about our retention rates and that will be – that's always an area of intense effort and I would say this year has been successful as well. Sure. Jim, it's Eric again. I think for all of our balance sheet businesses, we always need to be careful about how much they consume in risk-weighted assets versus the earnings and the opportunities that they could provide us. We do that certainly on a standalone basis because you have got to look at every asset on the balance sheet, whether it's lending asset for our loan book, for example, or securities finance business or enhanced custody business or FX business. And then you also have to think about it within the context of the client relationship because there is always a give and take and for a client that may not borrow very much, where they did do more securities finance for enhanced custody, that can be a reasonable mix and a way to serve them, but to serve them with decent returns. So, I would say there is certainly room in these businesses, but I think what we are doing is going into the end of the year as we close the Brown Brothers acquisition, we are being a bit disciplined about our risk-weighted asset position, right, because we want to close that deal, and we want to land within our capital ratios. And so I think while you have seen some very heavy growth in the last couple of quarters, just in the next one quarter to two quarters, I think you will see – you will continue to see some discipline. You have seen a little bit of that on the quarter-on-quarter balance sheet in some of the areas like securities finance. And you can imagine we will do that going into the beginning of next year. But what I would say is I think the franchise as we continue to grow the fee portion of the revenue base, manage our expenses, we can continue to put more capital to work over time, but sometimes there will be some ebbs and flows. And I think I have given you a little bit of an indication where we see some of those. Yes, Steve, I think the algorithm that you are referring to that we have – that I have described and we have described as a company is that servicing fee growth comes from a mix of equity market tailwinds, client activity inflows, net new business, we can either be positive as it has been the last couple of quarters, neutral or negative and then pricing headwinds, right. It's that four-part structure. I think the way I would update that is to say that the structure is still there and I think been fortified. I think the different areas move around a bit. I think equity market tailwinds, we have seen a very strong equity market tailwinds this year. I don't think we are going to see that every year, but we would like to see flat to up equity market. So, you can imagine that part of the tailwind was very positive this year, which we are pleased with. And the way we monetize that is we didn't take our expenses up with equity market uptick. The second one is client flows and activities. I think a couple of years back, this was a positive by a couple of points. I think a year or 2 years ago, as we saw outflows from packaged products in both – especially in the U.S. as mutual funds were on the wane and we saw less inflows in Europe. I think we felt less confident in client activity and flows of the tailwind. I think that's actually rebounded nicely this year, and we expect that to continue given the current market dynamics. Net new business, as you referenced, I think we have got a strong year here in terms of wins. That will now start to get implemented next year and the year after. So, that takes time, but we are pleased with the backlog. And then pricing, I think as I have said, I think on the first question this morning has been well controlled and we just work on that intensely every day. So, I think the structure is intact. Every year will bring a little different mix and different elements of the – of that framework. Sure. And let me open up the aperture a little bit. Remember, the core of our capital constraint is around CET1, right, our common equity Tier 1 ratio, which is really a risk-weighted asset-based measure, not a leverage ratio measure. So, on the leverage ratio, we just need to be kind of within bounds. And so the decision on deposits and NII within reason is really around what rate levels we are sitting at. I think the way to think about the positives when prevailing short rates, call it, Fed funds is at the current levels, near zero, you are not incentive to have deposits on the balance sheet. That breakeven tends to flip at around two or three rate hikes, around 75 basis points of Fed funds. You start to be in a more neutral position and at 100 basis points of Fed funds you start to be the right way around or you would prefer the deposits on the balance sheet. And so it's somewhere in that area, call it, two, three rate hikes from now, where we begin to seriously thinking about the benefit of adding more deposits instead of being – instead of holding them off. And so I think the question that we will – the decision criteria that we will get to is where are prevailing rates in the first quarter and the second quarter and the third quarter next year. And at that point, we will make some conscious decisions and trade off additional NII, which we would like to bring in, because it helps with our margin and our EPS. And we will just have to just be careful about the balance sheet size. But you have seen us manage the balance sheet side. You saw it this quarter. And in fact, it's not like we – well, we know where to judiciously manage the balance sheet. And I think we will continue to do that while bringing on deposits and serving our clients as best as we can. Sure. Gerard, it's Eric. It varies by business. On servicing fees, a large proportion of the up 7% was driven by the equity markets tailwind, a smaller proportion from client flows and net new business. And then in the other direction, you have the usual smaller amount of pricing headwinds, and we also called out a little bit of divestiture activity. So, it's kind of two-third, one-third, but what I think I am particularly pleased with is we are able to hold expenses flat, notwithstanding that. And that's not been our history here as we have managed. On the management fee side, it was just the way that that business tends to be priced. The market tailwinds tend to come in and are a very important part of the tailwind. But we also had, I think, very nice net new business performance on the revenue side. You see it in flows. We also counted in revenues. But you saw there, us taking up our margin in the asset management business. And so while we are creating the environment for either an equity market tailwind or a flow tailwind in asset management, it's the – we are also managing the other side of the P&L, and that's been quite remunerative for us this quarter and pleasing. See you shortly. And Rob, it's Eric. I would just add as we adjust our outlook a little bit. Part of that was just year end incentives we need to reward really strong performance. But we also talked about starting to leg into investments. And we like to invest behind the revenue, not ahead of the revenue, but behind the revenue, and that's what we are doing. One of those investments, to be honest, is engineering work, right, development work to actually automate processes, simplify processes and so forth. And so, part of what we are doing even into the fourth quarter is beginning some of that work so that several quarters from now, a year from now, 2 years from now, there is actually an engineering benefit. And so that's where it comes together as well. But as Ron said, it takes real hard work and it gets done in phases. Sure. And Vivek, it's Eric. You will see those costs in the acquisition restructuring line. So, we are purposely bounding it and – but including it in our financials. But they are modest. They are what you would expect us or any other acquirer to do in a deal. And given the combination, there is a real benefit in the execution here. Yes, Vivek, we – as part of our diligence, we looked at every part of this acquisition, how the revenues come together and there, there is a lot of share of wallet opportunity, expenses, how it comes together and certainly, the sweep program. The sweep program is modest when it comes to the bank counterparties. It's not enormous for any one bank provider. I think the top 10 bank providers are important. But if you think about what swept away, I think we said about $60 billion, $70 billion is swept away today across 10 large banks. You are not talking about a real capacity constraint. And we did – we have done and we have actually engaged with each of those bank counterparties, most of whom we know extremely well and who we do business with, right. We often do business with those counterparties on the sub-custody side or in terms of other arrangements. And so there is kind of a – there is a bidirectional set of relationships that we have. So, we don't see a lot of risk at this point and see more of an opportunity to actually sweep a little more, sweep a little less. What I would say is the core of the sweeps in U.S. dollar – and I don't need to be patriotic to say that the U.S. dollar is an extremely valuable deposit and cash currency. And so that's – so they are certainly valuable to U.S. and global banks. And so I think we have got a good program set up, and we see it continuing with some upside optionality for us. Sure. And Rajiv, it's Eric. I will just add the private markets, the hedge funds are all attractive asset classes for us. And so year-on-year, we saw a 7% growth this year across the servicing fee franchise. In the private markets, you are seeing 2, 3 percentage point higher growth than the average for the company. And that's one of the reasons why over the last year or 2 years and certainly going into the fourth quarter next year, we are investing more in private markets because we see those opportunities, and that adds to the growth trajectory of the company. Sure."

Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released strong second quarter financial results, which demonstrate the meaningful progress we are making towards achieving our medium-term targets as we continue to execute on the multiyear strategic pivot of our business to that of an enterprise outsourced solutions provider. I am particularly pleased with our results, as quarterly total fee revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time in the company’s history. We delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of servicing fee growth, with servicing fees at the highest level in three years, propelled by both strong equity markets and the impact of our actions to strengthen relationship management and sales effectiveness. We continue to differentiate State Street through our unique product and operational capabilities, as well as through delivering enhanced client service quality. Our pipeline continues to deliver as evidenced by another strong -- another quarter of strong servicing and Alpha client mandates, which I will discuss shortly. Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and innovate across the franchise to drive growth and enduring shareholder value creation. For example, we announced the formation of State Street Digital in the second quarter, a new division focused on addressing the industry’s evolving shift to digital finance, both as product offerings and as a business model. This is just one example in a long history of innovation that State Street has and is continuing to drive within our industry. We also continue to develop State Street Alpha, our front to back offering. This unique capability has created an attractive value proposition that is resonating with both new and existing clients, as well as contributing to client retention and growth opportunities, which I will also discuss shortly. Turning to slide three, I will review our second quarter highlights before handing the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Second quarter EPS was $2.07 or $1.97 excluding notable items. Despite the impact of our -- of interest rates on our NII earnings per share ex notables reached the highest level since 4 Q 2019 when quarterly NII was notably higher more than 35% more than it was into Q2 2021. Relative to the year ago period, quarterly total fee revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time, increasing 6% year-over-year, driven by solid servicing and management fee growth, which increased 10% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, as well as better securities finance results. The strong performance was partially offset by the year-over-year impact on total revenues from lower software and processing fees, continued moderation of FX market volatility and ongoing interest rate headwinds. Even with record quarterly fee revenue, expenses were well controlled. While second quarter total expenses were up 1% relative to the year ago period, they were down almost 0.5 percentage point year-over-year, excluding notable items and currency translation, as our productivity improvements continued to yield results. We have created a culture of expense discipline over the last two and a half years, and we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs over the remainder of 2021. Our strong fee revenue performance, coupled with continued cost discipline, delivered a 200-basis-point improvement to our pretax margin year-over-year, which reached nearly 30% in the second quarter, excluding notable items. Further return on equity was 12.6% or 11.9% excluding notable items in the second quarter. AUC/A increased to a record $42.6 trillion at quarter end, supported by higher period end equity market levels and new business onboarding. New asset servicing wins increased to $1.2 trillion for the quarter, including the large Alpha mandate with Invesco announced in April. We reported two new Alpha wins in the second quarter, taking the total number of Alpha clients to 15. After the second quarter close, we also entered into an Alpha mandate with Legal & General. Well Invesco is an example of how Alpha is helping to expand and deepen existing client relationships, the Legal & General win demonstrates how the Alpha strategy is also helping us forge new client relationships with the world’s most sophisticated investors. Our experience to-date gives us confidence that Alpha relationships will drive stronger retention rates for existing clients, while also allowing us to broaden and deepen those relationships as we add additional products and services to these existing mandates. Additionally, we are signing Alpha clients that are new to State Street, demonstrating that Alpha is enabling us to reach new clients and deliver front, middle and back office services in a differentiated manner. We also create the new relationships to help drive revenue growth of costs across clients segments and regions. For example, earlier this week we announced the new strategic alliance with First Abu Dhabi Bank. The alliance will create a full service enterprise offering for institutional investors in the Middle East and North Africa region. It will provide investors with extensive reach into more than 100 markets around the world. Clients will have access to State Street’s full suite of front, middle and back office capabilities in addition to our extensive data management and analytics solutions, which seamlessly integrates with First Abu Dhabi Bank’s regional suite of security services products, local expertise and regional direct custody network. At CRD, annual recurring revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $230 million and we remain pleased with how the business is performing, while also enabling and propelling our Alpha strategy. Global Advisors continued to demonstrate strong performance, AUM increased to $3.9 trillion and management fees increased to $504 million, both records benefiting from strong second quarter flows of $83 billion across the ETF, institutional and cash businesses, as we continue to leverage the strengths of our asset management franchise. In ETFs, our low cost and sector funds, as well as our ESG and commodity products continuing to enjoy good market share with low cost ETFs expanding share in the second quarter. And an institutional, our sales force and relationship management realignment, coupled with a strong products that lead to good revenue growth. Turnings to our balance sheet and capital, we returned over $600 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter, inclusive of $425 million of common share repurchases consistent with the limits set by the Federal Reserve. I am pleased with yet another strong performance under this year’s annual stress test. The new SCB framework provides us with additional flexibility to manage our capital pace. As examples, yesterday we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase of our third quarter common dividend to $0.57 per share and authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $3 billion during the third quarter of 2021 through the fourth quarter of 2022. To conclude, we had a very strong quarter, business momentum is building and we have demonstrating meaningful progress towards our medium-term financial targets. As I look ahead to support our strategic vision and help us achieve those targets, we are continuing to prioritize improvement in our fee revenue growth, while controlling costs by transforming the way we work and building a higher performing organization for the future. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my review of our second quarter results on slide four. We reported EPS of $2.07 or $1.97, excluding the $0.10 positive impacts of notable items, which was driven by a previously announced sale of majority stake in a legacy business. On a left panel of the slide, you can see strong results as we continue to drive fee revenue growth while controlling expenses. We delivered pretax margin expansion and solid earnings growth. As a result of the weaker dollar relative to the year ago period, we continue to show our year-on-year results excluding the impact of currency translation in the right column. We also show results excluding notable items on the bottom of the slide. Turning to slide five, you will see our business volume growth, period end AUC/A increased 27% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $42.6 trillion. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were largely driven by higher period end market levels, net new business growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 28% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter to $3.9 trillion, also a record. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net inflows. Turning to slide six, you can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Second quarter servicing fees increased 10% year-on-year, including currency translation, which was worth approximately 3 percentage points year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average market levels, positive net new business onboarded and client flows, only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and the absence of elevated prior year client activity. AUC/A wins totaled $1.2 trillion in the second quarter substantial -- substantially up from recent quarters, primarily as a result of the large Alpha client mandate announced last April that John just -- that Ron just mentioned. AUC/A won but yet to be installed also amounted to $1.2 trillion at quarter end, as we smoothly on boarded over $400 billion of client assets this past quarter. We remain focused on reigniting business growth across both client segments and regions. This quarter, we have strong growth in the EMEA region, aided by our intense coverage efforts, which now extend to approximately 350 overall of our top clients. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in growth AUC/A wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, and we have clearly exceeded that mark this year. I will remind you that installations typically occur in phases and overtime and deals will vary by fee and product mix. At this time, we expect the current won but yet to be installed AUC/A will be converted over the coming 12-month to 24-month time period with the associated revenue benefits beginning in 2022 and the majority occurring in 2023. As we said in June, we are pleased with our pipeline and our momentum. Turning to slide seven. Second quarter management fees reached a record $504 million, up 14% year-on-year inclusive a 2-percentage-point impact from currency translation and were up 2% quarter-on-quarter resulting in investment management pretax margin approaching 35%. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee performance benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF flows. These benefits were only partially offset by the run rate impact from the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional client asset reallocation, as well as about $25 million of money market fee waivers this quarter. While we previously estimated that money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately $35 million per quarter. As a result of the recent improvement in short end rates following the June FOMC meeting, we now expect that they will be about $20 million to $25 million per quarter for the rest of the year, which is about a third lower than we had previously expected. Global Advisors record solid flows across institutional, ETFs and cash for the quarter, with took -- the total amount amounting to $83 billion. We have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises, which are driving this momentum as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. Turning to slide eight, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading services, we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes, which remain above pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter. Relative to a strong second quarter in 2020, FX revenue fell 12% year-on-year as declining FX market volatility compared to the COVID environment last year, more than offset higher client volumes. FX revenue was down 17% quarter-on-quarter to invite moderation of client volumes from index rebalances experienced in the first quarter and lower market volatility. Our securities finance business recorded strong revenue growth, with fees increasing 18% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher enhance custody and agency balances as clients leverage rebounded. Finally, second quarter software and processing fees were down 12% year-on-year, largely due to the absence of prior year positive mark-to-market adjustments. Software and processing fees increased 24% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher CRD revenues. Moving to slide nine, I’d like to provide some further updates on our CR D and Alpha performance. We delivered strong standalone CRD results in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher client renewals and episodic fee revenues. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continue to grow nicely and were up 10% year-on-year, resulting in an increase in standalone annualized recurring revenue to $230 million. This quarter marks a three-year anniversary since announcing the CRD acquisition and we are very pleased with how the business has performed. We are winning in part thanks to State Street’s brand and reputation, and the benefit to clients of our integrated Alpha offering. On the bottom right of the slide we show some of the second quarter highlights from State Street Alpha mandates. We reported two new Alpha mandates during the second quarter, as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception through the second quarter, we now have five Alpha client mandates that are live. Although, Alpha deals usually take somewhat longer to implement given the size and scope, the payoff outweighs the longer implementation period as we are able to further expand share wallet to generate attractive revenue growth rates and increase the contract length, which can be up to 10 years in length for Alpha services that span the front and middle office. Turning to slide 10, second quarter NII declined 16% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of lower interest rate environment, our investment portfolio yields and sponsored member repo products. These impacts were partially offset by balance sheet expansion driven by higher balances. Relative to the first quarter, however, NII was flat has lower investment portfolio yields and the impact of short end rates were offset by further expansion of the investment portfolio and lending activity. On the right side of the slide, we show the growth of our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Total average deposits increased by $16 billion in the second quarter or an increase of 7% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the continued impact of the Federal Reserve’s expansionary monetary policy. While we continue to remain mindful of OCI risk in the current rate environment, we tactically added about $5 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio a few months ago, before the recent downdraft in rates. We also increased our average loan balances by approximately 5% quarter-on-quarter to over $29 billion, driven by higher utilization by asset managers and private equity capital call clients. We also have a number of initiatives in flight to reverse and reduce this recent deposit uptake that we saw during the quarter. Turning to slide 11, second quarter expenses excluding notable items increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by the weaker dollar. Excluding the impact of notable items and currency translation, total expenses were down nearly 0.5 percentage point year-on-year, as productivity savings for the quarter more than offset higher revenue related expenses and targeted investments and client onboarding costs. Compared to 2Q 2020, on a line item basis and excluding notable items and the impact of currency translation, compensation employee benefit costs was flat as we reduce high costs location headcount, which offset higher medical costs as claims began to normalize to pre-pandemic levels. Information systems and communications were up 5% due to continued investment in our technology estate. Transaction processing was up 10%, primarily driven by higher revenue related expenses for subcustody balances and market data costs. Occupancy was down 13%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts and some timing benefits. And other expenses were down 11%, primarily driven by lower than usual professional services fees. Relative to the first quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by the absence of seasonal and deferred compensation reported in the first quarter. So, overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate expense discipline, as we have effectively managed total expenses ex notables and currency down year-on-year in the second quarter, while driving strong total fee revenue growth. Moving to slide 12, on the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are pleased with our performance under this year CCAR with a calculated stress capital buffer well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a preliminary SCB at that floor. The new SCB framework provides us with additional flexibility to deploy our capital base in a number of different ways, including investment opportunities, dividends and buybacks. For example, yesterday we announced a 10% increase to our third quarter common dividends to $0.57 per share and our Board has authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $3 billion from the third quarter of 2021 through a year-end 2022. In addition, we are also pleased that the Federal Reserve has provided State Street with one additional year until January 1, 2024, to retain its current G-SIB surcharge of 1%. To the left of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels in excess of the requirements. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 11.2% as we had expected and sits above the upper end of our 10% to 11% CET1 target range. The improvement was driven by solid capital appreciation and we also manage down RWAs despite balance sheet growth. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio remains well above the regulatory minimum, but declined by 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 5.2%, primarily as a result of the further increase in average client balances as the Fed’s quantitative easing continues. We continue to think that our Tier 1 leverage ratio in the 5s as appropriate for our business model. And we can operate the lower end of this range for a number of quarters, while we consciously limit and reduce client deposits and offer them a range of liquidity alternatives. Turning to slide 13, in summary, our quarterly performance demonstrates solid business momentum on our topline and the scale we are driving within our operating model. Total fee revenue was up almost 6% year-on-year and exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time, with double-digit growth in servicing and management fees, despite the year-on-year headwind from the strong FX trading services results we had in the second quarter of last year during COVID. Our expenses remain well controlled as a result for productivity program. As a result, we were able to drive pretax margin and ROE close to our medium-term targets, notwithstanding the low rate environment. Next, I’d like to update you on our economic outlook for the remainder of the year and provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter outlook. At a macro level, our rate view broadly aligns the current forward rate curve and assumes that short end rates remain low and there is some modest deepening to the yield curve. We are also assuming global equity markets will be relatively flat to quarter end for the rest of the year, as well as continuing normalization of FX market activity. In terms of the third quarter of 2021, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 7% to 8% year-over-year, with servicing and management fees each expected to be up 7% to 9% year-over-year. This means full year fee guidance is likely to be better than the upper end of the full year range we previously provided. Regarding NII, despite the recent flattening of the yield curve, we have seen an increase in short end market rates and we now expect a modestly improved quarterly NII range of $460 million to $470 million per quarter for the rest of the year. Assuming rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to attenuate. Turning to expenses, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs. We expect that third quarter expenses ex notable items will be flattish, plus or minus 0.5 percentage point year-over-year in 3Q. These fee and expense guides for 3Q include approximately a point of currency translation year-over-year. On taxes, we expect that the 3Q 2021 tax rate will be in the middle of our full year range of 17% to 19%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Thank you, Eric. And with that, Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much.\nRon O'Hanley: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I just start -- wanted to start off by talking a little bit about the fee guide that you just went through. Could you just give us a sense as to the major drivers? I mean, I realized that throughout the call, you were talking about the pipelines up? You have got a reinvigorated sales effort going on? Is that what’s driving this so quickly or is there something else that’s happening that leads you to the fee guide raise? Thanks.\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. Betsy, why don’t I start and Eric will comment. I mean, it’s -- I wouldn’t describe it as so quickly. I mean, what you are seeing here is the product of a lot of months and years of work that’s now coming together and starting to bear fruit. So and not that we were done. We have more work to do. But I think really it is about some of the things that we have told you in the past that we have been up to that are coming together and starting to have the impact -- the desired impact here.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe you could just refresh how you are thinking about the asset management business and where you would like to lean into growth, what pockets you are looking to invest in and if that’s by geography, too, that would be helpful?\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. I mean, they -- we think of the business is having three core elements to it, the ETF business, the institutional business and the cash business. And both are well established franchises. The areas that we like to lean into are the institutional business, first, and I will come back to the ETF business. But the institutional business has very strong client relationships around the world, but a limited product set. So what -- we spent a lot of time thinking about is, how do we take those relationships and that distribution channel and leverage it in some way through enhancing our product capabilities. On the ETF side, we have been on a long path to developing the products that there, as well as deepening our presence in geographies outside the U.S. You have seen a lot of payoff from that particularly in EMEA. We will continue to grow that. Areas of growth include ESG, which for us continues to do very nicely, as well as just continuing to emphasize the advantages of our core product set. It was an -- it’s an institutionally designed product set. It has a lot of liquidity to it. And liquidity is important to many investors. So it’s emphasizing what we have there. And then the cash business is, obviously, it’s a function of interest rates. But we have a very sophisticated cash business that works in different interest rate environments and we will continue to present that to both existing asset management and asset servicing clients, as well as clients that don’t have either of those relationships with us.\nBetsy Graseck: Thanks, Ron. Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nRon O'Hanley: Hi, Brennan.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for the -- hey. How are you, Ron? Hi, Eric. So another follow-up on the updated outlook. I noticed, Eric, that you said, we are going to be above the upper end of the range for the full year, which doesn’t seem that challenging, given how strong things were here in the second quarter and given how good 3Q looks at this point. Is it possible to narrow that full year fee revenue outlook to something more specific than just a greater than sign? How are you thinking about it and how should we think about it? And then also what are your assumptions for balance sheet size embedded in the updated NII outlook? Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Brennan, it’s Eric. Let me describe it this way. I think we are seeing very good performance across a number of our businesses. In addition to some of the tailwinds that you get from equity markets and I think it’s a combination of both. Equity markets are up globally quarter-on-quarter 5%. So that gives us another step up for servicing and management fee businesses. But in addition, I think, what we are seeing is strength in net new business revenues. Last quarter, I said, we were relatively neutral on net new business and servicing fees. This quarter we are nicely positive on that front on the servicing fee side. In management fees, we have been booking a couple quarters here in a row of very nice inflows. They have come with annualized net new revenues that are solidly positive and create a tailwind as well. And then you saw, we have had good performance across our sec lending franchise, CRD had another good quarter and so we are comfortable with a higher guide. I think I gave you primarily third quarter information and then maybe just try to answer the question directly. The full year fee guide, if you recall, was taken up last quarter to 2.5% to 4% year-over-year. Remember that includes lapping ourselves from the COVID bumps from FX a year ago. So our guide has had been 2.5% to 4% for total fee growth. And I think now you can count on around 5% growth. So we are going to go from that range to about another point up over the top end of that range for the time being given what we know today.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Great. That’s fair. And the balance sheet size piece of the NII?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. The balance sheet always has puts and takes and ins and outs in this environment of quantitative easing. And what you have seen us do is we have tried to put some of the additional deposits to work, you have seen us take advantage of the increase in IOER and the Fed floor on the on repo rate. So that’s been constructive. We do need to manage also the size of the balance sheet, because as we compress the balance sheet that frees up leverage ratio capacity and then that feeds back into our ability to return capital. And so, we are pretty serious about compressing some of those deposits. We had more of an uptick in May and June. April was kind of roughly in line with the first quarter and so we are starting to chip away at that and we see a path to do that. I don’t think that will have much of an effect on NII. Remember at these low rates, deposits, when you -- the incremental deposit is worth a little bit, but not a lot. But it will be the right way to manage the balance of NII, which I think will comfortably sit in that new range that we have provided, while also freeing up space for capital return, which is an important priority for us.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thanks for providing that clarification, Eric. You also in your prepared remarks mentioned that fee rates vary. When you think about the nice uptick in your won but not funded mandates here. What is those fee dynamics look like? How should we think -- when we are starting to think about modeling, building those out from here? Are those -- is -- does the success of Alpha that you have had and Charles River, which we saw in the results today? Does that help support the fee rates for the businesses that you are working or is the competition just still so intense that that’s just too optimistic? How should we think about those fees that are oncoming? Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Sure, Brennan. It’s Eric again. I think there’s a real range here. What you tend to get, it’s not whether its Alpha deals or classic cutting accounting deals. It’s really the size of the deals tend to come at different fee rates. And so, we saw some larger deals this quarter and because it’s the denominator of assets is larger, they will come a little lighter in terms of fee rate. On the other hand, in first quarter, we had a set of wins that were well above our traditional fee rate. And so you kind of have a number of combinations and what we are always doing is on a profitability basis and on an incremental basis, always making sure that as we add revenues, we do it at healthy margins. We use it as a way to control our costs and be disciplined. And so I think fee rates will bounce around for wins in one quarter versus the next. But we are actually quite pleased with the fee rate for the first half of the year is well in line with our overall fee rate for the company and that bodes well as we leg into and implement some of these new wins.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thanks for that color.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning, Eric and Ron. Just wanted to ask a little bit more on the capital return, just in terms of how you land on the $3 billion number vis-à-vis your balance sheet potentially uses and also your capital ratio targets. Are you aiming for a total return payout? How are you -- under this new SCB, how do you kind of land on that number and how should we be thinking about, whether there’s would be potentially more room depending on some of those other factors? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Ken, it’s Eric. They are always facts and circumstances on individual capital return at any time in place. But let me give you the kind of the envelope and how we think about it from our standpoint about what’s possible and what we would like to do knowing that there’s always -- that they always have to manage to the individually to the quarters. But the SCB does give us some flexibility. So let me do it in the following way. One of the things we start with is, what is our CET1 ratio and you saw we put an 11.2%. The first thing you can do is compare that to what’s the target range 10% to 11%. You can say, look, first step is, how do we float down that ratio to the midpoint of that range and that provides $700 million and $800 million of capital or return capacity. So that’s one piece. Secondly, you go through earnings, earnings next quarter, the quarter after you guys will have projections of earnings. And what we do with those earnings, and say, how do we give those earnings back to shareholders in the form of capital return. So, one part of that is the dividend. And then the balance of the earnings can often be returned as buybacks. So that’s a -- that’s an intention we often have. So you can add those buybacks that cover the difference between earnings and dividends for the next, two quarters, three quarters, four quarters, five quarters, six quarters, because we gave you kind of a six quarter view. And then finally the one thing you have to keep in mind is the balance sheet always grows a bit, not at the same intensity that that lending oriented bank does, but our balance sheet might grow risk weighted assets by 5%. So there’s kind of a -- there’s always a bit of capital retention that’s necessary just to fund on $120 billion RWA 5%, you always need to retain maybe $600 million typically in a year of capital to hold against that. So if you go through those pieces, it’s literally the down -- the floating down. It’s the -- what earnings can support net of the dividend goes into buybacks and then it’s the modest amount of retention you need for some good underlying growth, which I think, pencils out to that up to $3 billion range.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Thanks for that call. Second question just on your NII guide and the range, you mentioned that premium am would continue to attenuate. Just wondering if you can help us understand how much attenuation would you expect and where was it this quarter versus some of the other factors that are kind of working against it to kind of keep us in the zone? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. Premium amortization actually is a bit bouncy from one quarter to the next, just given kind of where you are with individual bonds and so forth. But what’s happening is, you have got the grind on the investment portfolio, which can be in the $15 million to $25 million range. And then premium amortization can work in the opposite direction in the upcoming quarter as we are thinking it’s in the $15 million range, but it will bounce around. And so you kind of have this headwind of rates just floating through, premium amortization going the other way. But it can bounce around plus minus $5 million easily from one quarter to the next and that’s the kind of thing we just want to be careful of. What is nice is, we are starting to get to a leveling off of the net yields on the portfolios, roll-offs are starting to get better matched with roll-ons. That’s a good word to use roll-off and roll-on of bonds. And so you saw that we printed net yield on the investment portfolio without 1.11%, 1.12%. We are pretty close to the bottom of that yield and that’s what gives us comfort that we are in this range for the time being, though, as you could see from my prepared remarks. We took the that -- the upper end of that range up a bit, just because of the improvement in front end rates.\nKen Usdin: Understood. Okay. Thanks, Eric.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello there.\nRon O'Hanley: Hi, Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: So it’s good -- hello, there. So it’s good to see the margin back to the 30% range and if I listen not too carefully, I hear good markets, good organic growth, better commentary about fees, NII and fee waivers and continue to control expenses. So is -- the question is the 30%-ish margin here to stay for now, because it sounds like everything is moving in the right direction right now?\nEric Aboaf: I think -- Glenn, it’s Eric. I think here to stay is a pretty definitive term. I think what you can see is a solid progression over time in our margin and while one quarter doesn’t make a year, it doesn’t -- isn’t the intention that we have. I think you can see progress. I think you can see progress over quarters. You can see progress over years. I think there was a time when we would have taken the equity market tailwind and years ago, you would have seen expenses creep up a lot more than they did this quarter. And so I think you are seeing a discipline that’s pushing margin in the right direction and I think we are pleased with our performance. We would like to do it again and again. But that’s the -- I think the focus and the intensity we bring. But good results, I think, right direction and we -- as Ron said in some of his remarks, this has taken quarters and years to get to this point, but we need to keep at it to consistently deliver this kind of result.\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. Glenn, what I would add too is, as you know, margin is a part of our medium-term targets. We laid out those targets at a time when there was a very different NII picture. So it’s taking longer than we would have liked, but it’s very much part of what we said we were going to deliver. It’s built into management compensation. So I think that you should expect as much intensity around it tomorrow as you have seen up to now.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. Just one quick follow-up, on First Abu Dhabi, I just want to understand, is this eventually replacing outsourcing global custody in the region? Is there a broader mandate? I wonder if you could expand on what you expect or hope out of the relationship.\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. So, I mean, we have talked in the past about our intensified efforts in the Middle East. I mean, we have been there for a while. But we have taken a number of steps to augment our presence there. We have got full licenses or we have got licenses now in Saudi Arabia. Think of First Abu Dhabi as doing two things. One, we become the global custodian for their client base. Two, they become our subcustodian in regions where -- in parts of that region where we don’t have local custody. So replace other subcustodians in our network.\nGlenn Schorr: How quickly can that happen based on subcustodian fees?\nRon O'Hanley: I mean it’s starting now. I mean, we will start, obviously, there’s contracts that need to move and things like that. But it will happen pretty quickly over months and a couple of quarters, not years.\nGlenn Schorr: Excellent. Thank you for all that. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Hi. Good morning everybody on Friday. I was hoping to get a couple of questions on CRD. I guess, one, can we get an update on the uninstalled revenue backlog, $93 million? What’s the typical timeframe of those installations? And when it comes to new bookings, the $19 million, any color you guys could provide around client types and service types that are embedded with the $19 million that would be helpful. And then, I guess, just a numeric question, sorry, if I missed it, Eric, did you guys mention the episodic benefit, how much debt contributed to the quarter in CRD specifically?\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Alex, it’s Eric. Let me touch on each of those, because we are real pleased with the CRD performance both in terms of this quarter’s wins, the backlog, I think, the momentum, and obviously, how it contributes to the broader State Street whole. Just to take through the new bookings, $19 million for the quarter was a five-quarter high. Some of that, I think, you can easily ascribe to the Invesco win, which was front office, middle office, back office, as we continue to expand that relationship and you would have within the $19 million, the front office piece of that win. On the uninstalled backlog, the $93 million, it’s a mix of installations that come over six months, 12 months, 18 months, in some cases, 24 months. What I will remind you is that the longer installations tend to come with professional services fees as you prepare and do those implementations. The classic -- in the classic software sense, those get reimbursed and paid as part of many of the contracts, until you get to the go-live period, which in some cases a short for smaller installations. In other cases, it takes longer, just given the size and complexity of what we are onboarding. And then, I think, finally, you asked about the total revenues. The on-premise revenues were hit a high of another high, just like a year ago, coincidently of $63 million. Some of that was the classic re-upping of installations and that renew from three-year-old contracts, five-year-old contracts, that kind of stuff. I think some of the most episodic items in there are probably in the $20 million to $25 million range. So I just encourage you guys to take an average of quarters over five quarters, nine quarters, that kind of thing and that will give you a better sense for what’s typical in that on-premise line, but maybe that’s enough to start with.\nAlex Blostein: Yeah. That makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up around capital and just a follow-up to Ken’s question earlier. The fact that you guys are a little bit below your -- the low end of your target on Tier 1 leverage, it sounds like there’s room to manage those deposits out over time. How does that inform just the pace of buyback from here, the $3 billion that you guys got authorized last night? Should we think of that evenly spread out through the end of 2022 or a little bit more back-end loaded as you guys work through the balance sheet dynamics?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. That’s a fair question, because we have got to balance a number of different factors. I’d tell you on Tier 1 leverage, we are comfortable operating in the 5s and this is right way risk. If you think about it, we have got an influx of deposits. They are held at the safest place in the world, the Fed and the central banks. And so we are not particularly exercised that bumping at or even down a bit from the lower end of that range. So that’s fine as long as we have plans over time that we can execute and we do have those plans. That’s what we do for a living. And as I mentioned, we have got actions in place. Some of those deposits came in a little heavier in May and June. We have got a set, for example, of ongoing client discussions of a mix of commitments and ongoing discussions, for example, around $10 billion of those that are literally happening, that have happened last week, this week, and so there are ways for us to chip away at that. In terms of the buyback patterning, while it’s always dependent on facts and circumstances and exactly what’s going on at any point in time. We don’t have an interest in back loading buybacks necessarily, like, we would rather do them relatively smoothly, again all else being equal. And we think we have plenty of capacity given our higher levels of capital ratios and our strength and the confidence we have on our deposit management efforts to deliver those in a relatively consistent way, and in a way, I think, that shareholders would appreciate.\nAlex Blostein: Awesome. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Hi. Good morning, folks. I just want to come back to the balance sheet one more time, in terms of the size and how you are managing that. I don’t know if I missed it for the $460 million to $470 million quarterly guide, your -- what’s embedded in the size of the balance sheet, given that it did spike up in the second quarter, if that’s -- if your expectation is for that to moderate? And then longer term over the next six quarters in conjunction with the $3 billion buyback, you mentioned, obviously, keeping capital for balance sheet side. So maybe if you could give us some thoughts around whether your plan is within that buyback expectation to continue to grow the balance sheet on a year-over-year basis and how that contrasts with the comments about trying to reduce the excess deposits on the balance sheet?\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Brian, it’s Eric. There are a couple of factors in there that both get at a total balance sheet and then the risk weighted asset content on the balance sheet I think as we distinguish those two. Let me just tackle your questions in order. On the NII range of $460 million to $470 million per quarter for the next couple of quarters, that fully takes into account some of our deposit management efforts. Remember, the incremental $10 billion deposit doesn’t earn us a ton these days and so that’s been factored in to that range. And the underlying reason in that range has slowed up a little bit as the front-end rates have ticked up, which was gratifying. In terms of balance sheet growth, we need to contain the size of the balance sheet in terms of size, call it, leverage assets, right? That’s what we need to contain. Under the surface, there’s always some amount of healthy growth in risk weighted assets, right, because as we support our clients in the FX business or in the sec lending business or by lending to them, we have to expand those modestly. Now on our balance sheet we are a capital-light business. We have got a -- we have RWAs on our balance sheet that are in the $120 billion range. What -- I don’t know, there’s a range of what those can grow, but they are not growing at 10% a year. They may be growing 5%-ish a year, plus/minus a couple of points and so it’s kind of that level. And when you grow RWAs, that amount, you are not really adding to the leverage balance sheet. The leverage balance sheet, which connects with Tier 1 leverage is driven primarily with deposits and that’s separable from the RWA kind of growth typically.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. Got it. That’s clear. And then just maybe just back to the Abu Dhabi relationship, and as you said, Ron, you expect that to start moving pretty quickly. Should we think about any impact to AUC/A for State Street and asset servicing fees related to that or is it less material?\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. Brian, I would say that our -- I mean, clear it would -- our expectations would drive AUC/A. I think it will be a modest amount at the beginning. It will also help us to continue to contain and manage our subcustody costs. And maybe most importantly, over the medium-term, given the relationships there, it will help further our penetration in the region. So, I mean, that’s probably the most important reason to be doing it. They are just a terrific partner.\nBrian Bedell: Okay.\nRon O'Hanley: The other thinking, the challenge that we often have and others have, too, is that there can be times when you have got subcustodians and you like them, but you are competing with them in certain instances. And in this case we have -- we now have a subcustodian that we are not competing with.\nBrian Bedell: Right. Right. That makes sense. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning.\nRon O'Hanley: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: So I wanted to start off, Eric, maybe with a question on securities growth. And more specifically, I guess, related, sorry, to the LCR. You had strong deposit growth, as you noted. The LCR ratio is running a ratio is running a little bit tight at 104% versus 100% minimum. I was hoping if you can just give us some sense philosophically, how you are managing to LCR constraints? And just given the poor QE, liquidity treatment of QE related deposit growth, how does it impact your ability to deploy at higher yields and even just grow the securities growth book incrementally from here?\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Steve, it’s Eric. The LCR has some anomalies. I will remind you of in the calculation between the all-in corp LCR and the bank. And the best way I can describe it is what’s most pertinent to us as a institution, a bank holding company, is actually the bank LCR. The bank LCR is at 131%. So it’s extremely flush and it’s got plenty of room. What happens at the corp is that the additional deposits gets haircut just because of transferability, which is fine. And what happens in the calculation because of how the numerator is factored in for that and the denominator, I am happy to put you in touch with our IR team to share with you some of the scenarios is that, as we become more flush at the bank, which is a good thing, you have this odd result at the corporate holdco where the LCR goes down. What’s ironic is that, if we were to begin to reduce deposits, what happens mathematically is that the bank LCR starts to flow down from this very elevated 131% and the corporate LCR actually floats up. And I think it’s best to probably have, so when we work through the algebra with you, it’s just how the rules are configured, they are fine. But we are actually quite flush with LCR and are operating quite comfortably.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that color, Eric. And the follow-up I had is just on expenses. You have done a great job…\nEric Aboaf: Yeah.\nSteven Chubak: … of raising expense clearly in 2Q, the 3Q guide reinforces a similar trend, but there is some growing concern amongst investors, just given many of the other large banks are guiding higher on expenses talking about accelerating investments. I was hoping you might be able to give us some context on what the full year expense might look like for this year? And even talk thinking through what the growth algorithm might look like heading into next year, whether you might need to step up investments to keep up pace with peers ultimately.\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Steve, let me start. Expense has been a focus for several years in a row now. We have gotten expenses down, ex-notables and adjusted for currency, down 2% and 1.5% last year, and this year, what we have said is that on a nominal basis, we expect expenses on a full year basis to be flattish, plus or minus 0.5 basis point range. And that’s nominally and on an adjusted for currency basis and notables, it would be down by about a point, obviously, with a range around that. And obviously the biggest thing that we wrestle through this year, in particular, is that there are revenue related costs that come through, as we have mentioned, some custody costs are often AUC/A based, market data costs or AUC/A or AUM based. And so those are what we are working through and why we have a range there and we have stuck with our -- we have stuck and are sticking with that range given what we know today. I think the -- if I step back, the hallmark of our approach to cost is that you have got to systematically have productivity programs in place that actually save not a little bit, but save a good amount of cost, right? And I think we show you typically when we do our January call, at the beginning of the year that we are looking to take 4 percentage points or 5 percentage points of the expense base off through a set of productivity programs. We -- and that on a base of $8 billion, 4 point or 5 points is that’s significant amounts. It’s hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, but we are a scale business. That’s what we should be doing. And then at the same time, what we are doing is reinvesting a portion of that, not all of that, but a portion of that in the underlying business. And sometimes we invest by expanding coverage and sales forces. Sometimes, we reinvest by expanding and product feature functionality. Sometimes we invest as we onboard clients, right? We have some marginal cost that we have to have and we are usually happy to do that because it comes with revenues on the other side of it. And so our programmatic approach is to save sufficiently so that we can reinvest. And we will continue to do that. Now, how those balance out, we have given you a sense of how that balances out to down expenses in 2019 and 2020, it was down, and this year, we expect to be down as well, again, adjusted for notables and currency translation. How that plays out, we are going to keep working through. It’s a little early to talk about next year. But I think you can tell we are pretty focused on this. But, obviously, we do need to factor in revenue related cost and as equity market continue to tick upwards, we have to factor that in and that’s a little more of a feature this year and maybe even upcoming time periods than it has been and so that is something that we have to work through. But at least that’s the broad approach.\nSteven Chubak: That’s great color, Eric. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Eric. Good morning, Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Hi, Gerard.\nEric Aboaf: Hi.\nGerard Cassidy: Eric, can you -- I think you said on the call and I am trying to get the transcript, I think, obtain it. So I apologize I have to ask this question. I think you said on the call that new business wins this quarter contributed positively. I think you said maybe earnings versus last quarter it was neutral. First of all, could you clarify if it was earnings? But second, what was the changing dynamics between the two quarters that enabled this quarter to be a positive number versus last quarter it was neutral?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, it’s Eric. The -- I think you have got the good memory and summary, and let me just add the specifics. As part of my prepared remarks on servicing fees, right? I was clear that part of the increase on a year-on-year basis in servicing fees came from positive net new business. So, more wins installed than the usual modest amount of attrition that we get. And that is in contrast, you remember correctly, last quarter, I said, new business -- net new business was neutral, and I said, we were not as pleased as we would like to be. We would like it to be positive and it’s important for it to be positive. And part of what you are seeing is I think that, over the last couple of quarters, we have accelerated our wins and win rate. You see a little bit of that in AUC/As, but it’s bouncy, right? You have seen us put in place an installed business quickly in some cases. So remember, custody can get installed quickly when it’s won and so we have had some focus on some of those kinds of wins and those have come through. And the intention here is, how do you continue to sell and expand share of wallet with clients, not just with the top 60 as we have talked about, but the next 100 and the next 200. And so I think what we are starting to see is some of the effects of the or some of the results of that more intense coverage process, some of which we presented at one of the conferences back in June is starting to take root in a more, I will say, a more consistent way. That doesn’t mean it will happen every quarter, but we are, I think, quite pleased with this quarter and we see that it’s been building, it’s been a building -- the momentum has been building in this regard.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Then the follow-up question is on the Alpha product and you are having, obviously, some success now in winning over new customers. I guess, within that area, what percentage of your pool of customers, you just referenced, Eric, the top 60, for example? What percentage of your customers are eligible -- you think would be interested in the Alpha product? And second, when you talk to your customers about taking on Alpha, what are some of the challenges you have found to convince them that it’s really in their best interest to do it?\nRon O'Hanley: Hey, Gerard. It’s Ron. Why don’t I take that? I mean, in theory, I suppose we would say, 100% of them are eligible. Starting point really matters here. The clients that have been -- we have now got experience under our belt, 15 through the end of the second quarter, a whole lot more current conversations underway. Typically, there’s some kind of trigger point like an aging technology, ineffective or excessively costly operation stack that triggers this. The obstacles to it are several-fold, right? These are big change programs. And typically the institutions that are going forward with it, it’s not about a deputy head of operations has decided to come hire us. It’s almost always at least driven from the CIO and the COO, meaning the Chief Investment Officer and the Chief Operating Officer. And oftentimes, it’s on the CEO’s agenda. So when there’s that kind of focus on it, that’s when these things tend to happen. Now, just given what’s going on and some of the trends in the asset management industry. I mean, the industry is buoyant now with some of the underlying trends in terms of aging technology, real challenges around data management and how do you effectively use the data. You have these issues are on the agenda of most CEOs. So it’s very few instances where there’s not a conversation going on. How it plays out will be different, which is why we built the model the way it is, meaning it’s interoperability. We will -- we have had different wins where, in fact, we are interoperating with other front office systems to the extent we need to, such as Aladdin. And so we have tried to build this recognizing that these are very large sophisticated clients, long histories, lots of kind of software in their stacks and we want to make this work across a broad variety of clients.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Just as a quick follow-up on the share of wallet that you just referenced earlier, Eric. Have you guys found yet with the Alpha customers that you are having better success in expanding the share of wallet once you get them onboarded and up and running than a traditional customer?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. Gerard, it’s Eric. That’s exactly the result that we are seeing, because what we are finding is not only, do we expand up and down the value chain, we had the front office, the middle office in many cases and the back office. But as you do that, it’s much more natural to begin to, say, if you are going to add middle office and back office to begin to consolidate the custody, for example, in the relationship or to connect with the -- some of the trading activity that we have, because some of the trading activity can plug, for example, directly into Charles River. So that’s the underlying benefit is the expanded share of wallet, so supplemented by these become even stickier relationships. These become true partnerships as opposed to a service arrangement.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.\nJim Mitchell: Hey. Good morning. Ron, you noted that you want to lean into the institutional asset management business and this quarter was one of the best flow quarters in five years. So can you, I guess, one, describe in more detail what you are doing on the sales and distribution side to drive the improved growth? And I guess, secondly, when you talk about adding products and capabilities, what areas would you look to add? Is that an organic effort or does that need to be acquisition, just some help on that? Thanks.\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. I mean, we -- what we have done is over the course of now a couple of years, taken a very good sales and relationship management force and made it better. We have the benefit in most of our instances because of the core passive products, where if we are in a client, we tend to be if not the largest manager, one of the largest, which by definition gives you a seat at their table as they think about asset allocation, those kinds of things. So it’s been very systematically building out and upgrading our capability to have those conversations and provide those products and to have an increase share of their wallet. ESG has been providing some real tailwind here. We have got a long history in it. We have got a strong reputation in it and we have been able to both have those conversations and shape a lot of asset allocation there. In terms of products, I mean, it’s -- if you think about it, it’s -- we tend to dominate one end of the barbell. So as you look out across the rest of the barbell, almost anything would be eligible. Our focus is on now multi-asset products and building some of those ourselves or creating them bespoke from -- for very large clients through product capabilities that we already have. But the way we are thinking about it conceptually is that, we have a distinctive strength in terms of our institutional sales and client management capabilities and we are thinking about how to do that. We think there’s an organic opportunity. In terms of inorganic, I mean, those -- they are hard to engineer, right? So if something comes along that makes sense for our clients and for our shareholders, we will certainly look at it. But there’s been plenty of organic that we have been able to do that you are now seeing in the results.\nJim Mitchell: All right. Great. That’s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. In late 2018 you had around 40,000 employees, now you have 39,000 employees. So I was just wondering, you are putting on more revenues without adding headcount. To what role has technology played into that and what are your expectations going forward? And the big picture question is, what’s the state of your tech backbone in terms of, how much are you in the cloud, public cloud, private cloud, how much do you expect to remain for almost a decade later, after State Street first implemented the cloud, it didn’t go great last decade. It seems like it’s going better now. So kind of an update on that, and again, tying that back to headcount?\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. Mike, its Ron here. In terms of your point about the leverage we are getting out of the employee base, I’d make a couple of points there. That the composition of that also has changed too. I mean we are continuing to leverage and utilize lower cost locations, so you would find that the mix has changed over that period. But you are raising actually the more important point, which is technology. And listen, service productivity and it’s not just this service and it’s not just this firm, service productivity has been elusive for a long time now. And I think we and I suspect others are getting our arms around it. A lot of it is automation, a lot of it is taking an automation and services, it’s not the quite same thing as you envision, an automobile assembly line with lots of moving mechanical arms. It tends to be you are taking many, many tasks that constitute a job and automating those, such that what’s remaining in the job is higher value-added and those things where you need judgment. We are getting better and better at instituting that. We also, Mike, and we have talked about this in other context, we are spending a lot of time on measuring productivity. Again, manufacturers, the good ones have had this down for a long time, service companies it’s much newer. We have got a significant percentage for our company now that’s covered by productivity metrics. And sometimes, it’s -- the old Hawthorne effect, right? You just -- now that there’s a measure and you are saying, hey, there’s a difference between this group and that group, and they are pretty similarly situated and doing the same thing, what can we learn from that and that is starting to drive some of that productivity. On the technology side, I stand by the team that we have. It’s an outstanding team. It’s making a lot of progress. As you know, in technology, it’s -- some of it is about pure investment in new stuff and new capabilities and that’s part of the investment that we are making. A lot of it is around continuing to up our resilience. This is an ongoing issue for the industry, particularly in cyber as the cost to deal with that goes up and up and up. And as a G-SIB, we need to be at the lead and we want to be at the lead there. But I think we are making very good progress. It’s showing up in the numbers. Again, it’s the result, not just the things that we did last quarter, but the things that we have done now for many quarters and approaching years and they are starting to payoff and you will see more payoff in the future.\nMike Mayo: And just -- I found that very interesting, the analogy you gave with the auto assembly line. So when you automate a services business, how much of that can you automate leaving the value-added parts at the end? And again, on the headcount question, maybe you don’t want to answer that one or maybe you don’t know yet, going ahead, but those two follow-ups, please?\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. I mean, the -- you are asking the question and the first part of that next question you have asked, which is how far can we go? And we don’t know that yet, but we know there’s a lot more we can do than we have done. I mean to think about the striking of a NAV of a net asset value. I mean there’s a lot that goes into that and then there’s a lot of reconciliation and checking that goes into that. We are -- again as we have talked about in other forums, we are putting a lot of AI into that, right, to make that NAV calculation not be this flurry at the end of the day that begins at 4:00 and hopefully is done by 5:15. But in fact, it’s starting as soon as trading starts such that what you are doing at the end is really that final checking where you do need human intervention. So, and Mike, what was your question on people? Did I miss a question or headcount?\nMike Mayo: Yeah. Just -- no. Again, I was trying to make the connection between technology and headcount, and maybe I am forcing that connection. But your headcounts are flat. Your revenues look like they are going higher. You talked about backlogs, installation, intense, coverage process, do you expect headcount to start going up again given those initiatives and the backlog?\nRon O'Hanley: I think what you should expect to see from us is a breaking of the relationship that occurred in the past, which is that headcount and compensation related costs went up kind of at the same level as revenue did. What this really is about is just getting more scale and scale effect out of our system. And in the past some of our challenge has been that we tend to deal with the most sophisticated clients highest demanding. They pay us a lot of money. So their demands are justified. But we have gotten much better about getting scale easing out of those relationships in those operations and you should expect us to continue to do that.\nMike Mayo: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.\nRob Wildhack: Good morning, guys.\nRon O'Hanley: Hi, Rob.\nRob Wildhack: Just another question on CRD, you guys did a nice job highlighting some of the drivers of this quarter’s results. I am wondering if you could comment on the trajectory of the software enabled and professional services pieces. Do you think that the 10% growth that we saw this quarter is sustainable?\nEric Aboaf: Rob, it’s Eric. That certainly is sustainable. I think the, what we would actually like to do and you have seen in different quarters, if you go back to the last few earnings releases is that the combination of professional services and software enabled revenue is actually growing nicely in the double digits, it’s not -- in some cases, closer to 15%. And because what’s happening is two things. One is you have got take up in the market for new installations and I think we have described in the past, the number of SaaS clients, for example, is up. But you also have over time conversion from on-premise to SaaS, because clients are realizing the value of a cloud offering, a more standardized cloud offering. It still has to connect with their -- the rest of their estate, where they can then get upgrades and the new feature functionality that we roll out on a regular basis. So that’s a -- that component of the professional services and software enabled set of revenues in Charles River, I think, are going to be in the mid -- in the double-digit teens typically. They will just bounce around a little bit with professional services. But that’s a real -- that’s -- I think that’s the future of the franchise is in those areas.\nRon O'Hanley: Rob, what I would add to that is, much of the investment that we have or one of the key investments we have put into CRD was, in fact, are enhancing, it’s not overhauling the cloud offering. We have migrated that to the Microsoft Azure platform. It’s now being installed in clients. It gives a whole -- a combination of more standardization. But as Eric noted, more flexibility for clients that have unique needs. And particularly, as you get outside the United States, there’s very particular desires on where the data is located and Azure is giving us that ability to basically be flexible on that in terms of data location, which is -- should -- it’s basically a more robust SaaS offering than Charles River had when we bought it.\nRob Wildhack: Got it. And maybe relatedly, I did want to ask about profitability in CRD. Do you think that you are starting to see signs of scale in that business and then what do you think about the longer term profitability or margin profile of the business going forward?\nEric Aboaf: Rob, it’s Eric. Yeah. We are getting to that point. I think we bought Charles River three years ago as we said. We announced the deal and in the first year or two-year, we needed to reinvest in the platform. That was part of our deal modeling, was part of what we thought would lift revenue -- topline revenue from what was single digits into the low double digits on average we have said. And so we did need to reinvest last year of 2019, 2020 and this year. But I think we are starting to get to the point where it’s got now the scale and the functionality it should have, where it can -- where we can really deliver earnings growth over time and take advantage of the momentum and take up that we have seen in this business.\nRon O'Hanley: Rob, there’s been two -- I’d categorize the investments in Charles River in two broad categories. One is what you would have expected us to do for that matter, probably, any other buyer, which was, okay, we are going to enhance the offering here for Charles River and its historic established core business. The second category of investment has been related to the whole Alpha platform and making Charles River an integral part of that, enabling the kind of connectivity that Eric was talking about earlier connectivity to other parts of State Street connectivity, if you think about Charles River is the front to the middle and the back. And that’s been -- there’s been a lot of investment there and also a lot of development that’s come out of that. I mean it’s not like nothing has popped out, some of -- there’s been quite a bit that’s been completed and implemented. And we think we are kind of at -- that the peak of that and that, that should start to flatten and then decline.\nRob Wildhack: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja: Hi. A couple of questions for both of you, Ron and Eric. Firstly, Ron, you mentioned you have a wider -- you talked about the products in the asset management side, where does active stand and equity stand in your mind given that that has been stuck for the last four quarters. It hasn’t really moved despite the strong markets? Is that still something you want to be in? Do you exit or what’s your thinking there? I know it’s small, so but given your comment about how you got a wide window?\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. It’s small and much of our active equity also tends to be in the value space, right, which is, Vivek, is not yet seen enduring day in the sun. But we do believe that active will play a part and should play a part in portfolios. We actually think that the move to active ETFs will help propel that. It will provide a different vehicle to construct portfolios with. So we view this institutional relationship management channel is one -- again, given the nature of the people and the nature of the relationships as one that can accommodate a broad set of products including active equity.\nVivek Juneja: And would that really need an acquisition to sort of make a material impact on that or...\nRon O'Hanley: Again, we are focused -- the organic agenda is pretty full in terms of products at this point and that’s where our focus will be. I just hate to speculate about inorganic, because that’s all it would be speculation. Again, to the extent to which something came along that made sense for our clients and for our shareholders, we would certainly take a close look at it.\nVivek Juneja: And a completely separate question, if I may, the big win with someone like Invesco, huge existing client already. What is -- given that they are already a large client, what is the incremental services, and therefore, the incremental fee revenue from that, the $1 trillion sounds big, but how should we think about given that they are an existing client? Alpha, is that -- did you add middle office and front office, I mean, can you give us some perspective of how meaningful that kind of a win is?\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. It is a large client. But we certainly -- we are not the only servicer of them. So I would think about the services there in a few buckets. Firstly, some back office, which actually transitioned over before we even announced the win -- additional back office. Secondly, is front office in terms of Charles River, which will be the core operating platform for them. And then, thirdly, middle office, as you noted. So it’s really across the Board. And again, this is us partnering with them to help them achieve what they are trying to in terms of their technology and operation stack, because we do have a longstanding relationship with them. They have also partnered with us in terms of developing, helping us develop new features and functionality into the Alpha platform that will be extendable to other clients in the future.\nVivek Juneja: And I guess the middle office would probably come a little bit longer time to get installs as it normally does?\nRon O'Hanley: Right. Right.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Thank you, both.\nRon O'Hanley: Thanks.\nOperator: There are no other questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ron for closing remarks.\nRon O'Hanley: Thank you, Operator, and thanks to all of you on the call for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ron O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released strong second quarter financial results, which demonstrate the meaningful progress we are making towards achieving our medium-term targets as we continue to execute on the multiyear strategic pivot of our business to that of an enterprise outsourced solutions provider. I am particularly pleased with our results, as quarterly total fee revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time in the company's history. We delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of servicing fee growth, with servicing fees at the highest level in three years, propelled by both strong equity markets and the impact of our actions to strengthen relationship management and sales effectiveness. We continue to differentiate State Street through our unique product and operational capabilities, as well as through delivering enhanced client service quality. Our pipeline continues to deliver as evidenced by another strong -- another quarter of strong servicing and Alpha client mandates, which I will discuss shortly. Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and innovate across the franchise to drive growth and enduring shareholder value creation. For example, we announced the formation of State Street Digital in the second quarter, a new division focused on addressing the industry's evolving shift to digital finance, both as product offerings and as a business model. This is just one example in a long history of innovation that State Street has and is continuing to drive within our industry. We also continue to develop State Street Alpha, our front to back offering. This unique capability has created an attractive value proposition that is resonating with both new and existing clients, as well as contributing to client retention and growth opportunities, which I will also discuss shortly. Turning to slide three, I will review our second quarter highlights before handing the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Second quarter EPS was $2.07 or $1.97 excluding notable items. Despite the impact of our -- of interest rates on our NII earnings per share ex notables reached the highest level since 4 Q 2019 when quarterly NII was notably higher more than 35% more than it was into Q2 2021. Relative to the year ago period, quarterly total fee revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time, increasing 6% year-over-year, driven by solid servicing and management fee growth, which increased 10% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, as well as better securities finance results. The strong performance was partially offset by the year-over-year impact on total revenues from lower software and processing fees, continued moderation of FX market volatility and ongoing interest rate headwinds. Even with record quarterly fee revenue, expenses were well controlled. While second quarter total expenses were up 1% relative to the year ago period, they were down almost 0.5 percentage point year-over-year, excluding notable items and currency translation, as our productivity improvements continued to yield results. We have created a culture of expense discipline over the last two and a half years, and we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs over the remainder of 2021. Our strong fee revenue performance, coupled with continued cost discipline, delivered a 200-basis-point improvement to our pretax margin year-over-year, which reached nearly 30% in the second quarter, excluding notable items. Further return on equity was 12.6% or 11.9% excluding notable items in the second quarter. AUC/A increased to a record $42.6 trillion at quarter end, supported by higher period end equity market levels and new business onboarding. New asset servicing wins increased to $1.2 trillion for the quarter, including the large Alpha mandate with Invesco announced in April. We reported two new Alpha wins in the second quarter, taking the total number of Alpha clients to 15. After the second quarter close, we also entered into an Alpha mandate with Legal & General. Well Invesco is an example of how Alpha is helping to expand and deepen existing client relationships, the Legal & General win demonstrates how the Alpha strategy is also helping us forge new client relationships with the world's most sophisticated investors. Our experience to-date gives us confidence that Alpha relationships will drive stronger retention rates for existing clients, while also allowing us to broaden and deepen those relationships as we add additional products and services to these existing mandates. Additionally, we are signing Alpha clients that are new to State Street, demonstrating that Alpha is enabling us to reach new clients and deliver front, middle and back office services in a differentiated manner. We also create the new relationships to help drive revenue growth of costs across clients segments and regions. For example, earlier this week we announced the new strategic alliance with First Abu Dhabi Bank. The alliance will create a full service enterprise offering for institutional investors in the Middle East and North Africa region. It will provide investors with extensive reach into more than 100 markets around the world. Clients will have access to State Street's full suite of front, middle and back office capabilities in addition to our extensive data management and analytics solutions, which seamlessly integrates with First Abu Dhabi Bank's regional suite of security services products, local expertise and regional direct custody network. At CRD, annual recurring revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $230 million and we remain pleased with how the business is performing, while also enabling and propelling our Alpha strategy. Global Advisors continued to demonstrate strong performance, AUM increased to $3.9 trillion and management fees increased to $504 million, both records benefiting from strong second quarter flows of $83 billion across the ETF, institutional and cash businesses, as we continue to leverage the strengths of our asset management franchise. In ETFs, our low cost and sector funds, as well as our ESG and commodity products continuing to enjoy good market share with low cost ETFs expanding share in the second quarter. And an institutional, our sales force and relationship management realignment, coupled with a strong products that lead to good revenue growth. Turnings to our balance sheet and capital, we returned over $600 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter, inclusive of $425 million of common share repurchases consistent with the limits set by the Federal Reserve. I am pleased with yet another strong performance under this year's annual stress test. The new SCB framework provides us with additional flexibility to manage our capital pace. As examples, yesterday we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase of our third quarter common dividend to $0.57 per share and authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $3 billion during the third quarter of 2021 through the fourth quarter of 2022. To conclude, we had a very strong quarter, business momentum is building and we have demonstrating meaningful progress towards our medium-term financial targets. As I look ahead to support our strategic vision and help us achieve those targets, we are continuing to prioritize improvement in our fee revenue growth, while controlling costs by transforming the way we work and building a higher performing organization for the future. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thank you, Eric. And with that, Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Hi, Betsy. Yeah. Betsy, why don't I start and Eric will comment. I mean, it's -- I wouldn't describe it as so quickly. I mean, what you are seeing here is the product of a lot of months and years of work that's now coming together and starting to bear fruit. So and not that we were done. We have more work to do. But I think really it is about some of the things that we have told you in the past that we have been up to that are coming together and starting to have the impact -- the desired impact here. Yeah. I mean, they -- we think of the business is having three core elements to it, the ETF business, the institutional business and the cash business. And both are well established franchises. The areas that we like to lean into are the institutional business, first, and I will come back to the ETF business. But the institutional business has very strong client relationships around the world, but a limited product set. So what -- we spent a lot of time thinking about is, how do we take those relationships and that distribution channel and leverage it in some way through enhancing our product capabilities. On the ETF side, we have been on a long path to developing the products that there, as well as deepening our presence in geographies outside the U.S. You have seen a lot of payoff from that particularly in EMEA. We will continue to grow that. Areas of growth include ESG, which for us continues to do very nicely, as well as just continuing to emphasize the advantages of our core product set. It was an -- it's an institutionally designed product set. It has a lot of liquidity to it. And liquidity is important to many investors. So it's emphasizing what we have there. And then the cash business is, obviously, it's a function of interest rates. But we have a very sophisticated cash business that works in different interest rate environments and we will continue to present that to both existing asset management and asset servicing clients, as well as clients that don't have either of those relationships with us. Hi, Brennan. Hi, Glenn. Yeah. Glenn, what I would add too is, as you know, margin is a part of our medium-term targets. We laid out those targets at a time when there was a very different NII picture. So it's taking longer than we would have liked, but it's very much part of what we said we were going to deliver. It's built into management compensation. So I think that you should expect as much intensity around it tomorrow as you have seen up to now. Yeah. So, I mean, we have talked in the past about our intensified efforts in the Middle East. I mean, we have been there for a while. But we have taken a number of steps to augment our presence there. We have got full licenses or we have got licenses now in Saudi Arabia. Think of First Abu Dhabi as doing two things. One, we become the global custodian for their client base. Two, they become our subcustodian in regions where -- in parts of that region where we don't have local custody. So replace other subcustodians in our network. I mean it's starting now. I mean, we will start, obviously, there's contracts that need to move and things like that. But it will happen pretty quickly over months and a couple of quarters, not years. Yeah. Brian, I would say that our -- I mean, clear it would -- our expectations would drive AUC/A. I think it will be a modest amount at the beginning. It will also help us to continue to contain and manage our subcustody costs. And maybe most importantly, over the medium-term, given the relationships there, it will help further our penetration in the region. So, I mean, that's probably the most important reason to be doing it. They are just a terrific partner. The other thinking, the challenge that we often have and others have, too, is that there can be times when you have got subcustodians and you like them, but you are competing with them in certain instances. And in this case we have -- we now have a subcustodian that we are not competing with. Good morning. Hi, Gerard. Hey, Gerard. It's Ron. Why don't I take that? I mean, in theory, I suppose we would say, 100% of them are eligible. Starting point really matters here. The clients that have been -- we have now got experience under our belt, 15 through the end of the second quarter, a whole lot more current conversations underway. Typically, there's some kind of trigger point like an aging technology, ineffective or excessively costly operation stack that triggers this. The obstacles to it are several-fold, right? These are big change programs. And typically the institutions that are going forward with it, it's not about a deputy head of operations has decided to come hire us. It's almost always at least driven from the CIO and the COO, meaning the Chief Investment Officer and the Chief Operating Officer. And oftentimes, it's on the CEO's agenda. So when there's that kind of focus on it, that's when these things tend to happen. Now, just given what's going on and some of the trends in the asset management industry. I mean, the industry is buoyant now with some of the underlying trends in terms of aging technology, real challenges around data management and how do you effectively use the data. You have these issues are on the agenda of most CEOs. So it's very few instances where there's not a conversation going on. How it plays out will be different, which is why we built the model the way it is, meaning it's interoperability. We will -- we have had different wins where, in fact, we are interoperating with other front office systems to the extent we need to, such as Aladdin. And so we have tried to build this recognizing that these are very large sophisticated clients, long histories, lots of kind of software in their stacks and we want to make this work across a broad variety of clients. Yeah. I mean, we -- what we have done is over the course of now a couple of years, taken a very good sales and relationship management force and made it better. We have the benefit in most of our instances because of the core passive products, where if we are in a client, we tend to be if not the largest manager, one of the largest, which by definition gives you a seat at their table as they think about asset allocation, those kinds of things. So it's been very systematically building out and upgrading our capability to have those conversations and provide those products and to have an increase share of their wallet. ESG has been providing some real tailwind here. We have got a long history in it. We have got a strong reputation in it and we have been able to both have those conversations and shape a lot of asset allocation there. In terms of products, I mean, it's -- if you think about it, it's -- we tend to dominate one end of the barbell. So as you look out across the rest of the barbell, almost anything would be eligible. Our focus is on now multi-asset products and building some of those ourselves or creating them bespoke from -- for very large clients through product capabilities that we already have. But the way we are thinking about it conceptually is that, we have a distinctive strength in terms of our institutional sales and client management capabilities and we are thinking about how to do that. We think there's an organic opportunity. In terms of inorganic, I mean, those -- they are hard to engineer, right? So if something comes along that makes sense for our clients and for our shareholders, we will certainly look at it. But there's been plenty of organic that we have been able to do that you are now seeing in the results. Yeah. Mike, its Ron here. In terms of your point about the leverage we are getting out of the employee base, I'd make a couple of points there. That the composition of that also has changed too. I mean we are continuing to leverage and utilize lower cost locations, so you would find that the mix has changed over that period. But you are raising actually the more important point, which is technology. And listen, service productivity and it's not just this service and it's not just this firm, service productivity has been elusive for a long time now. And I think we and I suspect others are getting our arms around it. A lot of it is automation, a lot of it is taking an automation and services, it's not the quite same thing as you envision, an automobile assembly line with lots of moving mechanical arms. It tends to be you are taking many, many tasks that constitute a job and automating those, such that what's remaining in the job is higher value-added and those things where you need judgment. We are getting better and better at instituting that. We also, Mike, and we have talked about this in other context, we are spending a lot of time on measuring productivity. Again, manufacturers, the good ones have had this down for a long time, service companies it's much newer. We have got a significant percentage for our company now that's covered by productivity metrics. And sometimes, it's -- the old Hawthorne effect, right? You just -- now that there's a measure and you are saying, hey, there's a difference between this group and that group, and they are pretty similarly situated and doing the same thing, what can we learn from that and that is starting to drive some of that productivity. On the technology side, I stand by the team that we have. It's an outstanding team. It's making a lot of progress. As you know, in technology, it's -- some of it is about pure investment in new stuff and new capabilities and that's part of the investment that we are making. A lot of it is around continuing to up our resilience. This is an ongoing issue for the industry, particularly in cyber as the cost to deal with that goes up and up and up. And as a G-SIB, we need to be at the lead and we want to be at the lead there. But I think we are making very good progress. It's showing up in the numbers. Again, it's the result, not just the things that we did last quarter, but the things that we have done now for many quarters and approaching years and they are starting to payoff and you will see more payoff in the future. Yeah. I mean, the -- you are asking the question and the first part of that next question you have asked, which is how far can we go? And we don't know that yet, but we know there's a lot more we can do than we have done. I mean to think about the striking of a NAV of a net asset value. I mean there's a lot that goes into that and then there's a lot of reconciliation and checking that goes into that. We are -- again as we have talked about in other forums, we are putting a lot of AI into that, right, to make that NAV calculation not be this flurry at the end of the day that begins at 4:00 and hopefully is done by 5:15. But in fact, it's starting as soon as trading starts such that what you are doing at the end is really that final checking where you do need human intervention. So, and Mike, what was your question on people? Did I miss a question or headcount? I think what you should expect to see from us is a breaking of the relationship that occurred in the past, which is that headcount and compensation related costs went up kind of at the same level as revenue did. What this really is about is just getting more scale and scale effect out of our system. And in the past some of our challenge has been that we tend to deal with the most sophisticated clients highest demanding. They pay us a lot of money. So their demands are justified. But we have gotten much better about getting scale easing out of those relationships in those operations and you should expect us to continue to do that. Hi, Rob. Rob, what I would add to that is, much of the investment that we have or one of the key investments we have put into CRD was, in fact, are enhancing, it's not overhauling the cloud offering. We have migrated that to the Microsoft Azure platform. It's now being installed in clients. It gives a whole -- a combination of more standardization. But as Eric noted, more flexibility for clients that have unique needs. And particularly, as you get outside the United States, there's very particular desires on where the data is located and Azure is giving us that ability to basically be flexible on that in terms of data location, which is -- should -- it's basically a more robust SaaS offering than Charles River had when we bought it.

It's small and much of our active equity also tends to be in the value space, right, which is, Vivek, is not yet seen enduring day in the sun.

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my review of our second quarter results on slide four. We reported EPS of $2.07 or $1.97, excluding the $0.10 positive impacts of notable items, which was driven by a previously announced sale of majority stake in a legacy business. On a left panel of the slide, you can see strong results as we continue to drive fee revenue growth while controlling expenses. We delivered pretax margin expansion and solid earnings growth. As a result of the weaker dollar relative to the year ago period, we continue to show our year-on-year results excluding the impact of currency translation in the right column. We also show results excluding notable items on the bottom of the slide. Turning to slide five, you will see our business volume growth, period end AUC/A increased 27% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $42.6 trillion. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were largely driven by higher period end market levels, net new business growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 28% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter to $3.9 trillion, also a record. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net inflows. Turning to slide six, you can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Second quarter servicing fees increased 10% year-on-year, including currency translation, which was worth approximately 3 percentage points year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average market levels, positive net new business onboarded and client flows, only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and the absence of elevated prior year client activity. AUC/A wins totaled $1.2 trillion in the second quarter substantial -- substantially up from recent quarters, primarily as a result of the large Alpha client mandate announced last April that John just -- that Ron just mentioned. AUC/A won but yet to be installed also amounted to $1.2 trillion at quarter end, as we smoothly on boarded over $400 billion of client assets this past quarter. We remain focused on reigniting business growth across both client segments and regions. This quarter, we have strong growth in the EMEA region, aided by our intense coverage efforts, which now extend to approximately 350 overall of our top clients. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in growth AUC/A wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, and we have clearly exceeded that mark this year. I will remind you that installations typically occur in phases and overtime and deals will vary by fee and product mix. At this time, we expect the current won but yet to be installed AUC/A will be converted over the coming 12-month to 24-month time period with the associated revenue benefits beginning in 2022 and the majority occurring in 2023. As we said in June, we are pleased with our pipeline and our momentum. Turning to slide seven. Second quarter management fees reached a record $504 million, up 14% year-on-year inclusive a 2-percentage-point impact from currency translation and were up 2% quarter-on-quarter resulting in investment management pretax margin approaching 35%. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee performance benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF flows. These benefits were only partially offset by the run rate impact from the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional client asset reallocation, as well as about $25 million of money market fee waivers this quarter. While we previously estimated that money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately $35 million per quarter. As a result of the recent improvement in short end rates following the June FOMC meeting, we now expect that they will be about $20 million to $25 million per quarter for the rest of the year, which is about a third lower than we had previously expected. Global Advisors record solid flows across institutional, ETFs and cash for the quarter, with took -- the total amount amounting to $83 billion. We have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises, which are driving this momentum as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. Turning to slide eight, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading services, we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes, which remain above pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter. Relative to a strong second quarter in 2020, FX revenue fell 12% year-on-year as declining FX market volatility compared to the COVID environment last year, more than offset higher client volumes. FX revenue was down 17% quarter-on-quarter to invite moderation of client volumes from index rebalances experienced in the first quarter and lower market volatility. Our securities finance business recorded strong revenue growth, with fees increasing 18% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher enhance custody and agency balances as clients leverage rebounded. Finally, second quarter software and processing fees were down 12% year-on-year, largely due to the absence of prior year positive mark-to-market adjustments. Software and processing fees increased 24% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher CRD revenues. Moving to slide nine, I'd like to provide some further updates on our CR D and Alpha performance. We delivered strong standalone CRD results in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher client renewals and episodic fee revenues. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continue to grow nicely and were up 10% year-on-year, resulting in an increase in standalone annualized recurring revenue to $230 million. This quarter marks a three-year anniversary since announcing the CRD acquisition and we are very pleased with how the business has performed. We are winning in part thanks to State Street's brand and reputation, and the benefit to clients of our integrated Alpha offering. On the bottom right of the slide we show some of the second quarter highlights from State Street Alpha mandates. We reported two new Alpha mandates during the second quarter, as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception through the second quarter, we now have five Alpha client mandates that are live. Although, Alpha deals usually take somewhat longer to implement given the size and scope, the payoff outweighs the longer implementation period as we are able to further expand share wallet to generate attractive revenue growth rates and increase the contract length, which can be up to 10 years in length for Alpha services that span the front and middle office. Turning to slide 10, second quarter NII declined 16% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of lower interest rate environment, our investment portfolio yields and sponsored member repo products. These impacts were partially offset by balance sheet expansion driven by higher balances. Relative to the first quarter, however, NII was flat has lower investment portfolio yields and the impact of short end rates were offset by further expansion of the investment portfolio and lending activity. On the right side of the slide, we show the growth of our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Total average deposits increased by $16 billion in the second quarter or an increase of 7% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the continued impact of the Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policy. While we continue to remain mindful of OCI risk in the current rate environment, we tactically added about $5 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio a few months ago, before the recent downdraft in rates. We also increased our average loan balances by approximately 5% quarter-on-quarter to over $29 billion, driven by higher utilization by asset managers and private equity capital call clients. We also have a number of initiatives in flight to reverse and reduce this recent deposit uptake that we saw during the quarter. Turning to slide 11, second quarter expenses excluding notable items increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by the weaker dollar. Excluding the impact of notable items and currency translation, total expenses were down nearly 0.5 percentage point year-on-year, as productivity savings for the quarter more than offset higher revenue related expenses and targeted investments and client onboarding costs. Compared to 2Q 2020, on a line item basis and excluding notable items and the impact of currency translation, compensation employee benefit costs was flat as we reduce high costs location headcount, which offset higher medical costs as claims began to normalize to pre-pandemic levels. Information systems and communications were up 5% due to continued investment in our technology estate. Transaction processing was up 10%, primarily driven by higher revenue related expenses for subcustody balances and market data costs. Occupancy was down 13%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts and some timing benefits. And other expenses were down 11%, primarily driven by lower than usual professional services fees. Relative to the first quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by the absence of seasonal and deferred compensation reported in the first quarter. So, overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate expense discipline, as we have effectively managed total expenses ex notables and currency down year-on-year in the second quarter, while driving strong total fee revenue growth. Moving to slide 12, on the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are pleased with our performance under this year CCAR with a calculated stress capital buffer well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a preliminary SCB at that floor. The new SCB framework provides us with additional flexibility to deploy our capital base in a number of different ways, including investment opportunities, dividends and buybacks. For example, yesterday we announced a 10% increase to our third quarter common dividends to $0.57 per share and our Board has authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $3 billion from the third quarter of 2021 through a year-end 2022. In addition, we are also pleased that the Federal Reserve has provided State Street with one additional year until January 1, 2024, to retain its current G-SIB surcharge of 1%. To the left of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels in excess of the requirements. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 11.2% as we had expected and sits above the upper end of our 10% to 11% CET1 target range. The improvement was driven by solid capital appreciation and we also manage down RWAs despite balance sheet growth. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio remains well above the regulatory minimum, but declined by 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 5.2%, primarily as a result of the further increase in average client balances as the Fed's quantitative easing continues. We continue to think that our Tier 1 leverage ratio in the 5s as appropriate for our business model. And we can operate the lower end of this range for a number of quarters, while we consciously limit and reduce client deposits and offer them a range of liquidity alternatives. Turning to slide 13, in summary, our quarterly performance demonstrates solid business momentum on our topline and the scale we are driving within our operating model. Total fee revenue was up almost 6% year-on-year and exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time, with double-digit growth in servicing and management fees, despite the year-on-year headwind from the strong FX trading services results we had in the second quarter of last year during COVID. Our expenses remain well controlled as a result for productivity program. As a result, we were able to drive pretax margin and ROE close to our medium-term targets, notwithstanding the low rate environment. Next, I'd like to update you on our economic outlook for the remainder of the year and provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter outlook. At a macro level, our rate view broadly aligns the current forward rate curve and assumes that short end rates remain low and there is some modest deepening to the yield curve. We are also assuming global equity markets will be relatively flat to quarter end for the rest of the year, as well as continuing normalization of FX market activity. In terms of the third quarter of 2021, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 7% to 8% year-over-year, with servicing and management fees each expected to be up 7% to 9% year-over-year. This means full year fee guidance is likely to be better than the upper end of the full year range we previously provided. Regarding NII, despite the recent flattening of the yield curve, we have seen an increase in short end market rates and we now expect a modestly improved quarterly NII range of $460 million to $470 million per quarter for the rest of the year. Assuming rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to attenuate. Turning to expenses, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs. We expect that third quarter expenses ex notable items will be flattish, plus or minus 0.5 percentage point year-over-year in 3Q. These fee and expense guides for 3Q include approximately a point of currency translation year-over-year. On taxes, we expect that the 3Q 2021 tax rate will be in the middle of our full year range of 17% to 19%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Sure. Brennan, it's Eric. Let me describe it this way. I think we are seeing very good performance across a number of our businesses. In addition to some of the tailwinds that you get from equity markets and I think it's a combination of both. Equity markets are up globally quarter-on-quarter 5%. So that gives us another step up for servicing and management fee businesses. But in addition, I think, what we are seeing is strength in net new business revenues. Last quarter, I said, we were relatively neutral on net new business and servicing fees. This quarter we are nicely positive on that front on the servicing fee side. In management fees, we have been booking a couple quarters here in a row of very nice inflows. They have come with annualized net new revenues that are solidly positive and create a tailwind as well. And then you saw, we have had good performance across our sec lending franchise, CRD had another good quarter and so we are comfortable with a higher guide. I think I gave you primarily third quarter information and then maybe just try to answer the question directly. The full year fee guide, if you recall, was taken up last quarter to 2.5% to 4% year-over-year. Remember that includes lapping ourselves from the COVID bumps from FX a year ago. So our guide has had been 2.5% to 4% for total fee growth. And I think now you can count on around 5% growth. So we are going to go from that range to about another point up over the top end of that range for the time being given what we know today. Yeah. The balance sheet always has puts and takes and ins and outs in this environment of quantitative easing. And what you have seen us do is we have tried to put some of the additional deposits to work, you have seen us take advantage of the increase in IOER and the Fed floor on the on repo rate. So that's been constructive. We do need to manage also the size of the balance sheet, because as we compress the balance sheet that frees up leverage ratio capacity and then that feeds back into our ability to return capital. And so, we are pretty serious about compressing some of those deposits. We had more of an uptick in May and June. April was kind of roughly in line with the first quarter and so we are starting to chip away at that and we see a path to do that. I don't think that will have much of an effect on NII. Remember at these low rates, deposits, when you -- the incremental deposit is worth a little bit, but not a lot. But it will be the right way to manage the balance of NII, which I think will comfortably sit in that new range that we have provided, while also freeing up space for capital return, which is an important priority for us. Sure, Brennan. It's Eric again. I think there's a real range here. What you tend to get, it's not whether its Alpha deals or classic cutting accounting deals. It's really the size of the deals tend to come at different fee rates. And so, we saw some larger deals this quarter and because it's the denominator of assets is larger, they will come a little lighter in terms of fee rate. On the other hand, in first quarter, we had a set of wins that were well above our traditional fee rate. And so you kind of have a number of combinations and what we are always doing is on a profitability basis and on an incremental basis, always making sure that as we add revenues, we do it at healthy margins. We use it as a way to control our costs and be disciplined. And so I think fee rates will bounce around for wins in one quarter versus the next. But we are actually quite pleased with the fee rate for the first half of the year is well in line with our overall fee rate for the company and that bodes well as we leg into and implement some of these new wins. Sure. Ken, it's Eric. They are always facts and circumstances on individual capital return at any time in place. But let me give you the kind of the envelope and how we think about it from our standpoint about what's possible and what we would like to do knowing that there's always -- that they always have to manage to the individually to the quarters. But the SCB does give us some flexibility. So let me do it in the following way. One of the things we start with is, what is our CET1 ratio and you saw we put an 11.2%. The first thing you can do is compare that to what's the target range 10% to 11%. You can say, look, first step is, how do we float down that ratio to the midpoint of that range and that provides $700 million and $800 million of capital or return capacity. So that's one piece. Secondly, you go through earnings, earnings next quarter, the quarter after you guys will have projections of earnings. And what we do with those earnings, and say, how do we give those earnings back to shareholders in the form of capital return. So, one part of that is the dividend. And then the balance of the earnings can often be returned as buybacks. So that's a -- that's an intention we often have. So you can add those buybacks that cover the difference between earnings and dividends for the next, two quarters, three quarters, four quarters, five quarters, six quarters, because we gave you kind of a six quarter view. And then finally the one thing you have to keep in mind is the balance sheet always grows a bit, not at the same intensity that that lending oriented bank does, but our balance sheet might grow risk weighted assets by 5%. So there's kind of a -- there's always a bit of capital retention that's necessary just to fund on $120 billion RWA 5%, you always need to retain maybe $600 million typically in a year of capital to hold against that. So if you go through those pieces, it's literally the down -- the floating down. It's the -- what earnings can support net of the dividend goes into buybacks and then it's the modest amount of retention you need for some good underlying growth, which I think, pencils out to that up to $3 billion range. Yeah. Premium amortization actually is a bit bouncy from one quarter to the next, just given kind of where you are with individual bonds and so forth. But what's happening is, you have got the grind on the investment portfolio, which can be in the $15 million to $25 million range. And then premium amortization can work in the opposite direction in the upcoming quarter as we are thinking it's in the $15 million range, but it will bounce around. And so you kind of have this headwind of rates just floating through, premium amortization going the other way. But it can bounce around plus minus $5 million easily from one quarter to the next and that's the kind of thing we just want to be careful of. What is nice is, we are starting to get to a leveling off of the net yields on the portfolios, roll-offs are starting to get better matched with roll-ons. That's a good word to use roll-off and roll-on of bonds. And so you saw that we printed net yield on the investment portfolio without 1.11%, 1.12%. We are pretty close to the bottom of that yield and that's what gives us comfort that we are in this range for the time being, though, as you could see from my prepared remarks. We took the that -- the upper end of that range up a bit, just because of the improvement in front end rates. Sure. I think -- Glenn, it's Eric. I think here to stay is a pretty definitive term. I think what you can see is a solid progression over time in our margin and while one quarter doesn't make a year, it doesn't -- isn't the intention that we have. I think you can see progress. I think you can see progress over quarters. You can see progress over years. I think there was a time when we would have taken the equity market tailwind and years ago, you would have seen expenses creep up a lot more than they did this quarter. And so I think you are seeing a discipline that's pushing margin in the right direction and I think we are pleased with our performance. We would like to do it again and again. But that's the -- I think the focus and the intensity we bring. But good results, I think, right direction and we -- as Ron said in some of his remarks, this has taken quarters and years to get to this point, but we need to keep at it to consistently deliver this kind of result. Sure. Alex, it's Eric. Let me touch on each of those, because we are real pleased with the CRD performance both in terms of this quarter's wins, the backlog, I think, the momentum, and obviously, how it contributes to the broader State Street whole. Just to take through the new bookings, $19 million for the quarter was a five-quarter high. Some of that, I think, you can easily ascribe to the Invesco win, which was front office, middle office, back office, as we continue to expand that relationship and you would have within the $19 million, the front office piece of that win. On the uninstalled backlog, the $93 million, it's a mix of installations that come over six months, 12 months, 18 months, in some cases, 24 months. What I will remind you is that the longer installations tend to come with professional services fees as you prepare and do those implementations. The classic -- in the classic software sense, those get reimbursed and paid as part of many of the contracts, until you get to the go-live period, which in some cases a short for smaller installations. In other cases, it takes longer, just given the size and complexity of what we are onboarding. And then, I think, finally, you asked about the total revenues. The on-premise revenues were hit a high of another high, just like a year ago, coincidently of $63 million. Some of that was the classic re-upping of installations and that renew from three-year-old contracts, five-year-old contracts, that kind of stuff. I think some of the most episodic items in there are probably in the $20 million to $25 million range. So I just encourage you guys to take an average of quarters over five quarters, nine quarters, that kind of thing and that will give you a better sense for what's typical in that on-premise line, but maybe that's enough to start with. Yeah. That's a fair question, because we have got to balance a number of different factors. I'd tell you on Tier 1 leverage, we are comfortable operating in the 5s and this is right way risk. If you think about it, we have got an influx of deposits. They are held at the safest place in the world, the Fed and the central banks. And so we are not particularly exercised that bumping at or even down a bit from the lower end of that range. So that's fine as long as we have plans over time that we can execute and we do have those plans. That's what we do for a living. And as I mentioned, we have got actions in place. Some of those deposits came in a little heavier in May and June. We have got a set, for example, of ongoing client discussions of a mix of commitments and ongoing discussions, for example, around $10 billion of those that are literally happening, that have happened last week, this week, and so there are ways for us to chip away at that. In terms of the buyback patterning, while it's always dependent on facts and circumstances and exactly what's going on at any point in time. We don't have an interest in back loading buybacks necessarily, like, we would rather do them relatively smoothly, again all else being equal. And we think we have plenty of capacity given our higher levels of capital ratios and our strength and the confidence we have on our deposit management efforts to deliver those in a relatively consistent way, and in a way, I think, that shareholders would appreciate. Sure. Brian, it's Eric. There are a couple of factors in there that both get at a total balance sheet and then the risk weighted asset content on the balance sheet I think as we distinguish those two. Let me just tackle your questions in order. On the NII range of $460 million to $470 million per quarter for the next couple of quarters, that fully takes into account some of our deposit management efforts. Remember, the incremental $10 billion deposit doesn't earn us a ton these days and so that's been factored in to that range. And the underlying reason in that range has slowed up a little bit as the front-end rates have ticked up, which was gratifying. In terms of balance sheet growth, we need to contain the size of the balance sheet in terms of size, call it, leverage assets, right? That's what we need to contain. Under the surface, there's always some amount of healthy growth in risk weighted assets, right, because as we support our clients in the FX business or in the sec lending business or by lending to them, we have to expand those modestly. Now on our balance sheet we are a capital-light business. We have got a -- we have RWAs on our balance sheet that are in the $120 billion range. What -- I don't know, there's a range of what those can grow, but they are not growing at 10% a year. They may be growing 5%-ish a year, plus/minus a couple of points and so it's kind of that level. And when you grow RWAs, that amount, you are not really adding to the leverage balance sheet. The leverage balance sheet, which connects with Tier 1 leverage is driven primarily with deposits and that's separable from the RWA kind of growth typically. Sure. Steve, it's Eric. The LCR has some anomalies. I will remind you of in the calculation between the all-in corp LCR and the bank. And the best way I can describe it is what's most pertinent to us as a institution, a bank holding company, is actually the bank LCR. The bank LCR is at 131%. So it's extremely flush and it's got plenty of room. What happens at the corp is that the additional deposits gets haircut just because of transferability, which is fine. And what happens in the calculation because of how the numerator is factored in for that and the denominator, I am happy to put you in touch with our IR team to share with you some of the scenarios is that, as we become more flush at the bank, which is a good thing, you have this odd result at the corporate holdco where the LCR goes down. What's ironic is that, if we were to begin to reduce deposits, what happens mathematically is that the bank LCR starts to flow down from this very elevated 131% and the corporate LCR actually floats up. And I think it's best to probably have, so when we work through the algebra with you, it's just how the rules are configured, they are fine. But we are actually quite flush with LCR and are operating quite comfortably. Yeah. Sure. Steve, let me start. Expense has been a focus for several years in a row now. We have gotten expenses down, ex-notables and adjusted for currency, down 2% and 1.5% last year, and this year, what we have said is that on a nominal basis, we expect expenses on a full year basis to be flattish, plus or minus 0.5 basis point range. And that's nominally and on an adjusted for currency basis and notables, it would be down by about a point, obviously, with a range around that. And obviously the biggest thing that we wrestle through this year, in particular, is that there are revenue related costs that come through, as we have mentioned, some custody costs are often AUC/A based, market data costs or AUC/A or AUM based. And so those are what we are working through and why we have a range there and we have stuck with our -- we have stuck and are sticking with that range given what we know today. I think the -- if I step back, the hallmark of our approach to cost is that you have got to systematically have productivity programs in place that actually save not a little bit, but save a good amount of cost, right? And I think we show you typically when we do our January call, at the beginning of the year that we are looking to take 4 percentage points or 5 percentage points of the expense base off through a set of productivity programs. We -- and that on a base of $8 billion, 4 point or 5 points is that's significant amounts. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, but we are a scale business. That's what we should be doing. And then at the same time, what we are doing is reinvesting a portion of that, not all of that, but a portion of that in the underlying business. And sometimes we invest by expanding coverage and sales forces. Sometimes, we reinvest by expanding and product feature functionality. Sometimes we invest as we onboard clients, right? We have some marginal cost that we have to have and we are usually happy to do that because it comes with revenues on the other side of it. And so our programmatic approach is to save sufficiently so that we can reinvest. And we will continue to do that. Now, how those balance out, we have given you a sense of how that balances out to down expenses in 2019 and 2020, it was down, and this year, we expect to be down as well, again, adjusted for notables and currency translation. How that plays out, we are going to keep working through. It's a little early to talk about next year. But I think you can tell we are pretty focused on this. But, obviously, we do need to factor in revenue related cost and as equity market continue to tick upwards, we have to factor that in and that's a little more of a feature this year and maybe even upcoming time periods than it has been and so that is something that we have to work through. But at least that's the broad approach. Sure. Hi. Gerard, it's Eric. The -- I think you have got the good memory and summary, and let me just add the specifics. As part of my prepared remarks on servicing fees, right? I was clear that part of the increase on a year-on-year basis in servicing fees came from positive net new business. So, more wins installed than the usual modest amount of attrition that we get. And that is in contrast, you remember correctly, last quarter, I said, new business -- net new business was neutral, and I said, we were not as pleased as we would like to be. We would like it to be positive and it's important for it to be positive. And part of what you are seeing is I think that, over the last couple of quarters, we have accelerated our wins and win rate. You see a little bit of that in AUC/As, but it's bouncy, right? You have seen us put in place an installed business quickly in some cases. So remember, custody can get installed quickly when it's won and so we have had some focus on some of those kinds of wins and those have come through. And the intention here is, how do you continue to sell and expand share of wallet with clients, not just with the top 60 as we have talked about, but the next 100 and the next 200. And so I think what we are starting to see is some of the effects of the or some of the results of that more intense coverage process, some of which we presented at one of the conferences back in June is starting to take root in a more, I will say, a more consistent way. That doesn't mean it will happen every quarter, but we are, I think, quite pleased with this quarter and we see that it's been building, it's been a building -- the momentum has been building in this regard. Yeah. Gerard, it's Eric. That's exactly the result that we are seeing, because what we are finding is not only, do we expand up and down the value chain, we had the front office, the middle office in many cases and the back office. But as you do that, it's much more natural to begin to, say, if you are going to add middle office and back office to begin to consolidate the custody, for example, in the relationship or to connect with the -- some of the trading activity that we have, because some of the trading activity can plug, for example, directly into Charles River. So that's the underlying benefit is the expanded share of wallet, so supplemented by these become even stickier relationships. These become true partnerships as opposed to a service arrangement. Rob, it's Eric. That certainly is sustainable. I think the, what we would actually like to do and you have seen in different quarters, if you go back to the last few earnings releases is that the combination of professional services and software enabled revenue is actually growing nicely in the double digits, it's not -- in some cases, closer to 15%. And because what's happening is two things. One is you have got take up in the market for new installations and I think we have described in the past, the number of SaaS clients, for example, is up. But you also have over time conversion from on-premise to SaaS, because clients are realizing the value of a cloud offering, a more standardized cloud offering. It still has to connect with their -- the rest of their estate, where they can then get upgrades and the new feature functionality that we roll out on a regular basis. So that's a -- that component of the professional services and software enabled set of revenues in Charles River, I think, are going to be in the mid -- in the double-digit teens typically. They will just bounce around a little bit with professional services. But that's a real -- that's -- I think that's the future of the franchise is in those areas. Rob, it's Eric. Yeah. We are getting to that point. I think we bought Charles River three years ago as we said. We announced the deal and in the first year or two-year, we needed to reinvest in the platform. That was part of our deal modeling, was part of what we thought would lift revenue -- topline revenue from what was single digits into the low double digits on average we have said. And so we did need to reinvest last year of 2019, 2020 and this year. But I think we are starting to get to the point where it's got now the scale and the functionality it should have, where it can -- where we can really deliver earnings growth over time and take advantage of the momentum and take up that we have seen in this business."

Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRon O’Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the environment we’re operating in today as compared to this time last year and then highlight some of the data that evidence the progress we are making towards enhancing and improving our operating model and innovating across our franchise all the while being an essential partner for our clients. Relative to the first quarter of 2020, the first three months of 2021 could hardly be more different. Economic activity is sharply rebounding, unemployment is declining and equity markets have recovered strongly from the crisis levels experienced in 2020. Although, short end rates remain at historically low levels, long end US bond yields are rebounding. While COVID-19 infection and death rates remain stubbornly high in many parts of the world, there is clearly light at the end of this pandemic tunnel. The owners and managers of the world’s capital are also looking to the future into the next stage of growth. As the economy and financial markets continue to recover and investment inflows continue to grow, we remain focused on delivering for our clients across segments and regions. As demonstrated by our first quarter financial results, State Street continued to successfully navigate the improving operating environment. Although, as I noted, short term interest rates, which compressed further during the first quarter, remain a critical headwind for our industry. While we cannot control interest rates, we are resolutely focused on implementing our strategy and pivoting our business to being more of an enterprise outsourced solutions provider, underpinned by the ongoing development and delivery of our State Street Alpha front to back platform. And we look forward with confidence for a number of reasons. First, we further built upon our reputation for reliability during the crisis and our clients know they can depend on us to deliver the services and market solutions they need in good times and in bad. Second, throughout the crisis, we continue to invest in further strengthening and distinguishing our global operating model, client service and operational resiliency, which has been apparent to and noted by our clients. Third, many clients are reassessing their own operating models. And as a result, we have the opportunity to take on more of their operations and data activities, allowing them to focus on creating better investment outcomes for their clients. Fourth, our employees continue to perform at very high levels despite a year of largely remote work and disrupted routines. I am grateful for their extraordinary dedication and service. Last, both our Alpha and non-Alpha institutional servicing value propositions continue to resonate and enjoy take up as demonstrated by some recent announcements. For example, we reported an additional three State Street Alpha clients during the first quarter and separately this morning, we announced the full front to back Alpha relationship with Invesco, adding front and middle office services to our existing back office mandates. Through the open architecture nature of our operating platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships, unlocking new sources of revenue and strengthening the interoperability element of our Alpha value proposition, which is appealing to clients. After quarter end, we announced that M&G has appointed us to provide outsource middle office services in addition to our existing fund accounting company services. State Street will administer the middle office services on Aladdin, exemplifying how we offer clients the benefit of choice regarding their front end and middle office systems. These deals highlight how we are uniquely positioned to win front to back mandates as well as to win new business as a result of interoperable nature of our operating platform. While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our strategy, we also continue to innovate across our franchise. For example, a growing demand exists for ESG solutions that will provide the necessary data, risk analytics and reporting capabilities at scale. To that end, during the first quarter we introduced enhancements to our ESG solutions that can now provide clients with the ability to address new global ESG regulatory requirements for a single platform. Global Advisors’ new US corporate ESG ETF launched in EMEA in late 2020 and grew to $5.4 billion of AUM by the end of the first quarter, making it the largest corporate bond ESG funds in the use of space. We also continue to develop our digital asset strategy as we prepare to deploy our capabilities and servicing [Technical Difficulty]. We recently announced our intention to serve as the VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF. Subject to regulatory approval, we will work with VanEck to provide services, including ETF basket operations, custody of the ETF shares on the counting order taking and transfer agency in multiple jurisdictions. Next, I will review our first quarter highlights before handing the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Turning to Slide 3. First quarter EPS was $1.37 or $1.47 excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago period, first quarter total revenue declined 4%, driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, total fee revenue increased 4%, driven by servicing and management fee growth, which increased 7% and 6% year-over-year respectively, as well as an improved software and processing fee performance. Collectively, these more than offset the year-over-year headwind from FX trading as compared to the exceptionally strong first quarter of trading last year. While our FX trading revenues are down year-over-year, first quarter revenue remains well above pandemic levels as a result of higher client volumes and the investment we have made in our platforms and talent in recent [Technical Difficulty]. Even with rising total fee revenue, first quarter total expenses were essentially flat year-over-year, excluding notable items and currency translation as productivity improvements are paying off. Furthermore, we have successfully reduced high cost location headcount relative to the period one year ago. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to control core operating expenses over the remainder of 2021. At the end of the first quarter, AUC/A and AUM both increase to record levels supported by higher period end markets. AUC/A increased to $40.3 trillion, new asset servicing wins were a solid $343 billion, while servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods amounted to $463 billion at quarter end. Global Advisors’ AUM increased to $3.6 trillion and also benefited from a very strong flow performance in ETFs and a solid performance in the cash business. At CRD, annual recurring revenue increased 14% to $225 million and we remain pleased with how the business is performing while also enabling our Alpha strategy. Overall, we had a strong start to the year and remain confident that we have a clear path to our medium term targets discussed in January. To conclude, we continued to successfully navigate and distinguish ourselves in a fluid [Technical Difficulty] moving operating environment as demonstrated by our first quarter results. We remain focused on further developing and growing our Alpha [offline] and are pleased with the recent client activity. Meanwhile, we also continue to innovate across and grow many areas of our franchise. During the first quarter, we returned $659 million of capital to our shareholders through a combination of common share repurchases and common dividends. For the second quarter of 2021, our Board has authorized up to 425 million of common stock repurchases consistent with the limit set by the FED.  And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron and good morning, everyone. I’ll begin my review of our first quarter results on slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.37 or $1.47 excluding the impact from notable items, which amounted to $0.10 in the first quarter as detailed in the panel on the right side of the slide. On the left to the slide, you can see that we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth while expenses were well controlled despite higher market values and client volumes. As a result of the depreciating dollar relative to the year ago period, we also show our first quarter results excluding the impact of currency translation in the column to the right. Total fee revenue was up almost 4% year-over-year or up 2% excluding the impact of currency translation despite the significantly year-on-year headwind from the exceptional FX trading services results we had in the first quarter of last year due to the pandemic. For context, total fee revenue excluding FX trading services was up 9% year-on-year or 7% excluding the impact of currency translation with strong mid single digit growth in servicing fees, management fees and securities finance. Expenses were roughly flat year-on-year excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation, which you can see at the bottom of the slide. So in total this was a solid quarter, demonstrating the progress we’re making, improving our operating model as we drive towards growth. Turning to Slide 5, you’ll see strong business volume growth across the franchise. Period end AUC/A increased 26% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to a record $40 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client flows and net new business growth. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increase the result of higher period end equity market levels, better client flows and net new business, which more than offset the impact of lower bond markets. We’re seeing that both retail and institutional investors have moved off the sidelines and we’re seeing inflows globally across most product types that we now custody. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 34% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to $3.6 trillion, also a record. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net ETF and cash inflows. Our ETF franchise had a strong flow performance again as the US ETF industry experience record flows. Spider net inflows amounted to over $23 billion in the first quarter with both sectors and industries and low costs doing particularly well. Turning to Slide 6. First quarter servicing fees increased 7% year-on-year, including currency translation, which was worth approximately 3 percentage points year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average market levels and normal pricing headwind. Servicing fees were also up 5% quarter-on-quarter as a result of the higher average market levels and stronger client activity. This quarter, we saw good growth in asset managers, alternatives and official institutions. I’m pleased with how 2021 has started as the first quarter AUC/A wins totaled a solid $343 billion, which is up from recent quarters. And for context, last quarter you heard me outline that we need approximately $1.5 billion of annual gross sales volumes in order to drive net underlying growth, which means offsetting typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds in our servicing business. I’m also pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of client segments and deal sizes with an attractive overall fee rate as we continue to work on generating broad based growth across our clients, segments and regions. As an example, you may have also seen that earlier in the quarter we announced that we have assumed that depository bank and fund administrative activities of a subsidiary of Intesa Sanpaolo in Europe. AUC/A 1 but yet to be installed amounted to $463 billion at quarter end. Positively, both are reported wins and to be installed numbers exclude the two recently announced mandates, which Ron mentioned just a moment ago, as these deals were signed after the end of the first quarter. Turning to Slide 7, let me discuss several other [important] fee revenue lines in more detail. First quarter management fees were $493 million, up 6% year-on-year, including 2% impact from currency translation but were flat quarter-on-quarter. Both our year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee performance has benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong flow performance within our ETF and cash businesses, partially offset by an idiosyncratic client asset reallocation from higher fee products as well as money market fee waivers. Regarding money market fee waivers, we had about $15 million this quarter and we expect that they will increase given the significant downward move in short end rates in March. If they persist, we expect company wide impact could be around $50 million to $55 million per quarter for the rest of the year beginning in 2Q and of distribution fee, though higher balances should be worth roughly $10 million to $15 million per quarter, leaving the net impact closer to $40 million per quarter. FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the exceptional first quarter of 2020, FX trading revenue fell 22% year-on-year but it was up 7% quarter-on-quarter with higher volumes across both developed and emerging market currency pairs. While FX market volatility declined relative to the fourth quarter, we continue to see higher client volumes as our FX business continued to benefit from many years of investment across six venues and now 47 markets, three of which we added and two of which we expanded in the last year alone. Our securities finance business recorded its second consecutive quarter of good revenue growth, increasing 8% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of [higher] enhanced custody balances driven by new mandates from alternative clients and increase in fixed income assets on loan within our agency lending program. Finally, our first quarter software and processing fees were up 55% year-on-year and down 15% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to changes in mark-to-market adjustments. Moving to Slide 8, we have here CRD standalone revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated CRD revenues into three categories to help to see through the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the revenue recognition accounting rules for on premise revenue. Total CRD revenues increased 4% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher software enabled revenue and was 10% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely due to seasonally higher on premise revenues in the fourth quarter. As shown on the Slide, the more durable SaaS and professional services revenues increased by a strong 21% combined growth rate relative to the year ago period. On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the first quarter highlights of State Street Alpha. We reported an additional three Alpha clients during the first quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate with our client base, and this doesn’t include this morning’s first quarter and quarter end announcement. The Alpha pipeline continues to remain promising as the economic disruption in the last year has helped clients realize the transformational potential of the Alpha platform for their technology and operations infrastructure. Turning to Slide 9. First quarter NII declined 30% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of the low interest rate environment on our investment portfolio and the absence of $20 million market related benefits in the first quarter of 2020. Quarter-on-quarter, NII declined 6% as expected. Around 3% of the sequential quarter decline was due to the impact of lower long end rates on our investment portfolio despite a sequential improvement in premium amortization. Approximately 1 percentage point of the sequential decline was due to just a half quarter’s downdraft in short end rates on our sponsored member repo activity, and the rest was due to the lumpier items, including day count. These impacts were partially offset by higher deposit balances as you can see on the right of the slide. Total average deposits increased by $20 billion in the first quarter or an increase of 10% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of the Federal Reserve’s expansionary monetary policy. We remain mindful of OCI risk to our capital. So as the US Treasury sold off dramatically during the first quarter, we gently trimmed the investment portfolio and may selectively reinvest a bit over the coming months at higher rates. Turning to Slide 10, we’ve again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex notables, so that the underlying trends are clearly evident. Excluding notable items, first quarter expenses increased 2% year-on-year which is all driven by the weaker dollar, which means we effectively held underlying expenses flat year-on-year. On a line item basis, compensation employee benefits was up only 1% excluding the impact of currency translation as higher seasonal expenses were partially offset by reduction in headcount in higher cost locations. Information systems and communication expenses were up 3% excluding the impact of currency translation due to higher software costs and continued investment in our technology estate. Transaction processing expenses were up just 1% ex FX as our savings initiatives offset significant volume based growth in subcustody and market data costs. Occupancy and other expenses were both down several points. Relative to the fourth quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal and deferred compensation. Overall, I’m pleased with the underlying expense performance in the first quarter as we absorbed approximately $15 million of variable revenue related costs. We continue to demonstrate operating model improvements as we drive increased productivity through automation, reengineering and scale. Moving to Slide 11, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the improving operating environment with strong capital levels. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio was up slightly year-on-year but fell 1.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 10.8%. Relative to the fourth quarter, our capital base was impacted by lower AOCI as a result of the significant run up in long end US treasury yields as well as by an increase in intangibles related to the recently announced lift up deal we completed with Intesa Sanpaolo. We also saw $6 billion increase in episodic RWA, primarily related to FX trading and overdraft activity. This RWA headwind was transient in nature and has already declined by $5 billion. So at the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio will be over 11%, all else being equal. Tier 1 leverage was down year-over-year and fell by 1 percentage point quarter-on-quarter to 5.4%, primarily as a result of higher average assets, driven by the increase in quarterly average deposit balances as well as the AOCI change and the $500 million partial call for Series F preferred securities announced in January. As you can see on the slide and as I mentioned previously, we continue to consider a CET1 target range of 10% to 11% as appropriate level of capital for our business. Further, we consider that a Tier 1 leverage ratio between 5.25% and 5.75% as also being appropriate for our business model and can comfortably operate in this quarter this year even with the recent growth in deposits. Last, as we look ahead and as Ron noted, for the second quarter of 2020, our Board has authorized up to $425 million of common stock repurchases consistent with the limit set by the Fed. Turning to Slide 12, we provide a summary of our first quarter results. Despite the continued headwind from historically low interest rates, I am pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our business as well as the progress we are making within our institutional services franchise. Total fee revenue was up almost 4% year-on-year, including the significant year-on-year headwind from the exceptional FX trading services result we had in the first quarter of last year. And excluding FX trading services, total fee revenue was up 9% year-over-year or 7% excluding the impact of currency translation with solid mid single digit growth across servicing fees, management fees and sec lending. And with that strong top line fee growth, expenses were well controlled and were held roughly flat year-over-year excluding notable items and the headwind from foreign currency translation, demonstrating the progress we’re making in improving our operating model. Next, I would like to update our full year economic outlook and provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter. At a macro level, our full year interest rate outlook assumes that short end rates remain pressured and there is some modest steeping of the yield curve, in line with the current forwards, which suggests modestly improving premium amortization so the pace of improvement remains uncertain. We’re also now assuming global equity markets will be flattish to the current levels for the rest of the year or up around 10% point-to-point from the beginning of 2021 as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility. In terms of the second quarter of 2021, our guide includes about 2 percentage points of currency tailwinds for fee revenue and 2 percentage points of headwinds for expenses. So we expect that overall fee revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year depending on equity market levels with servicing and management fees up 7% to 8% as we anniversary a strong 2Q 2020 in FX trading and CRD. Regarding NII, given the impact of historically low short end rates as well as the impact of long end rates in our investment portfolio, we now expect NII to run around $460 million to $465 million per quarter from here in 2021, assuming premium amortization continues to attenuate. Turning to expenses. We remain laser focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs. We expect that second quarter expenses ex notable items will be up around 2.5% year-over-year or relatively flat ex currency translation with some potential for variability due to the revenue related costs. On taxes, we expect that the 2Q ‘21 tax rate will be towards the upper end of our full year range of 17% to 19%. While it is still early in the year, we are taking up our full year fee revenue guide again and now expect full year fee revenue to be up 2.5% to 4%. We also expect that slightly higher revenue related variable costs will add about 50 basis points to our prior full year expense guide of flat to down 1% ex notable items. Just remember, there’s a solid point of FX translation in these full year fees and full year expense guides. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRon O’Hanley: Thanks, Eric. And operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: So maybe we could start with servicing fees. I was hoping, first, we could unpack sort of Q1 dynamics a bit more. So ex currency translation, servicing fees were up about 4% sequentially. Maybe you can just kind of walk us through how much was the market and higher volumes versus more kind of organic trends in the quarter? And then taking a step back, it really sounds like momentum in front to back is progressing pretty nicely. So I was hoping you could bridge these data points you highlighted on the call, sort of back to the servicing fee algorithm that, Eric, you talked about in the past kind of between markets pricing, new business. I think collectively, that added up to like maybe a low single digit growth over time. Kind of how does that feel to you guys now given some of the changes you’ve seen in the business?\nEric Aboaf: Let me start on the quarter and then we’ll talk a little more about the momentum in the business. I think we felt like we had a solid quarter here. As you saw, servicing fees were up 7% year-over-year in aggregate. I mentioned about 3 percentage points of that was just currency translation. So the underlying growth was around 4%. If we were to decompose the 4% and you know there’s always a mix of items here, the largest positive driver was equity market appreciation. So equity market appreciation across the low equity markets were up north of 20% on average. That translated to about 6% tailwind in servicing fees for the quarter. And then against that we had the normalized amount of -- the normal amount of fee headwinds of about 2%, which brought us down to the net 4%. So it was a good quarter. I think what we continue to focus on is there tends to be some tailwind in our model from flows and client activity. This quarter we had some of that but we also had it a year ago in a good amount, so that was relatively neutral on a year-on-year basis. And then the other component is net new business. And as I’ve said I think pretty clearly, we have had lighter sales quarters over the last four to six quarters. We need to take that up. And as that happens, we’ll be in a position to have net new business growth. For the time being, net new business is relatively neutral, which is okay but not enough and not at the levels that we’d like to be and that’s, I think, partly why we have been real clear around the amount of net new business we need to win. We’ve been actioning that on a segment basis or regional basis. You’ve heard about our coverage model expansion. All those are components of that acceleration, which I think are well along and starting to show some positive results as I highlighted and asset managers, for example, an alternative and that I think will be to our advantage in the coming time periods.\nRon O’Hanley: Why don’t I just add to that, the second part of your question, I think what you’re basically asking is how does Alpha fit in all this and how does it change those numbers? Clearly, we’re pleased with the progress with Alpha 3 reported wins in the first quarter. And as we noted, one that we reported already for the second quarter, about a third of our business to be installed, the $463 billion to be installed is Alpha related and we would expect that to grow just given some of the things that we’ve talked about. What that means, though, is these are longer installations. Remember, in effect, we’re becoming the enterprise outsourcer to these clients. So it will be nice revenue impact but we’re talking about 2022 and 2023 revenue impact relatively little of that, certainly the things that we reported for the first quarter will we see in 2021.\nAlex Blostein: And then maybe a quick one on capital. Obviously, ratios came down sequentially for the reasons that you described, not particularly surprising. I guess maybe talk to us a little bit about the willingness to dip below 5.25% Tier 1 leverage if the balance sheet remains elevated or maybe even grows from here for one reason or another. And if you guys are willing to sort of continue to execute on your capital return plan, how much flexibility do you have going below the low end, I guess, of your target and staying there?\nEric Aboaf: We’re on the capital return plan that’s largely driven by our common equity Tier 1 ratios, which had some volatility this quarter but are still solidly above, I think, or we’ll return solidly above the range. So we’ve got confidence in what we can do there. On Tier 1 leverage, there are probably a couple of different aspects of that matter. I think, first, we’d like to operate in this quarter of 5.25% to 5.75%. And we have some little more room in the balance sheet to -- if we get pushed on deposits. But as you remember, we also have some ability to adjust that. If you recall, we added some discretionary deposits over the last two year time period, and those are in the $10 billion, $15 billion, $20 billion range, so there’s some tactical ways we can accommodate clients and then continue to manage the size of the overall balance sheet. I think we certainly have an ability occasionally to move outside and below the range on the 5.25% if we’re the right way around. And right now, it’s right way risk, so to speak, because it’s clients rather is coming to us because of the strength of our brand, that’s pushing that ratio. And so we can always do that for a quarter or two if necessary. And so part of what we’re very mindful of is how do we continue to support our clients during this time of fed easing. And so there are ways to navigate through that during the year, and we kind of see that as just part of our normal business activity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So there’s some good things going on in the quarter, but I think the ROE and the pretax margin are still pretty far below targets. I think the margin one is in, over time, given the headwinds on rates and fee waivers that you just described. But on the ROE side, do you view that as simply a function of capital built in getting down to closer to your targets, because it felt like better than an 8% ROE quarter, the momentum in the business feels better than that, but that’s a low ROE, considering all the growth that you built. So just curious on how you think about that.\nEric Aboaf: A couple of things just to keep in mind first. First quarter every year is always our low point on margin and ROE because of the seasonal deferred incentive compensation expenses. So those come through and then we’ve got to take a full year look. So I’d just be a little cautious on that. I think more broadly in terms of ROE that’s really a focus. I think you’ve seen in our proxy over the last few years, ROE has a management target. We added margin to that and now fee revenue. So we’re incredibly focused on those three major leverage points. And I’ve got to tell you I’ve got entire management team who’s thinking about those every month and every quarter. I think the way I think about ROE is probably from a couple of perspectives in terms of its trajectory. I think, first, continued work on margin. And this year, we’re just trying to hold margins steady, notwithstanding given the falling interest rates. But you’ve seen us actually hold expenses flat and fee revenues up. That is going to, over time, extend margin and filter back into ROE and every 2 points of expansion in margin is a point of ROE. So there’s real, I think, flow through there. And then I think the second one you hinted is around capital return. We’re very pleased to return 100% of earnings this year, this quarter, in the first quarter, in line with the fed limits. We’ve done that again in second quarter. And we’re committed to a pattern of capital return as a way to return capital to investors and to drive up ROE. And so I think there’s a path in that way as well.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. Maybe one quick follow-up on the fee waivers. I heard your comments on 15 growing to 50 and 40 net. Just as a sequential number, that’s a big step up. And I know how it works generically, but I’d love to hear how you think about like was a yield wire, obviously, trip, so to speak, in the quarter? And then more importantly, how much and which part of the current needs towards or which reference points need to go up over what level to get us back to a more breathable level, because 15 to 50 is a big step?\nEric Aboaf: I think the good news here is while we have some fee, money market fee waivers, we don’t have the size of money market fee waivers that others are seeing around the industry just because of the more institutional nature of our money market complex. So I think that’s some context to help with. The money market fee waivers are effectively driven by short end rates. It could be everything from overnight repo to one month and three month treasuries. And effectively, as one and three month treasuries fell from kind of 8 basis points, 9 basis points down to 3 basis points, 4 basis points and 5 basis points in March, you’re starting to get to the point where the reinvestment rate against the management fee rate starts to be inflected. And as a result, we are at that pressure point. And literally, the 4 basis points or 5 basis point move at the point does have the impact as you’ve seen. I think the good news here is we’ve continuously cash inflows into our complex, part of that comes from the easing and the monitory policy that we’re seeing. Part of that is, I think, we have an attractive set of offerings. And I’ll tell you that that’s all been factored into our guide and part of what we’re managing through.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Just maybe one more on rates. Maybe focus on the net interest revenue outlook, the 460 to 465 on a quarterly basis. Given the view of both the forward curve and premium amortization likely easing down over the course of the year, even if short rates are sort of stable where they are now, what would prohibit that 465 from improving in the second half? Is there a mix shift assumption within the next -- I would have thought it would improve as we get to the later part of the year.\nEric Aboaf: I think the best way to understand it is the short rates had an impact in the first quarter, and then we’ll now have three months worth of that in the second quarter, so that’s what drives the the additional nudge down from what we would have preferred to have seen. On long end rates, long end rates have been a headwind all through last year as they came down, and now even at this current level are a headwind for the portfolio. They were a headwind in the portfolio, for example, from 4Q to 1Q by about 5 points of NII, but has started to work against the long end rate impact is premium amortization, which has started to come down and that was actually a tailwind sequentially of about 2 points of NII. And so you’re kind of having this continued headwind from long end rates, which just has to play through. Remember, the average duration of the portfolio is about three years. Think about when long rates were -- when the rate cycle started was a year ago, so there’s another year of long end rates being a headwind. What we’re now looking for is the premium amortization to slow down. Now we need to be careful about the pace of that slowing down, but that is expected to slow based on the various models, and that starts to create a partial offset to those long end rate headwinds. And what we’re looking for is the crossover point. And we think sometime in the second half of this year, long end rates will still be a headwind but premium amortization should begin to offset that and thus, the collection of those two will be roughly neutral. And that’s effectively why we don’t see an uptick because that long end rate headwind just continues on effectively for that two to three year time period that has to flow through the books. And what we need to see over time is for premium amortization to fall substantially enough so that there is some uplift. We just don’t see that happening this year. And I think the question is how and when that begins to turn. And what I’m trying to do is avoid getting out ahead of us because we just need to see it play out, and I think we’ll know more in the coming couple of quarters.\nBrian Bedell: And then on the Invesco win. So just to maybe talk about the calibration of revenue and expense, typically, when you have these installments, there’s a little bit of expense ahead of time before the revenue comes in. Maybe if you could just characterize if that’s the case, or are you actually able to build revenue sort of immediately after it’s installed to offset that? And then I think you were doing the -- correct me if I’m wrong, but I think you were doing most of the custody fund accounting for Invesco. So this optically would be an add-on in revenue but your custody base wouldn’t change so much. Therefore, it would appear to be a price improvement given you’re getting more revenue from the same customer. Maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit?\nEric Aboaf: Brian, let me just step back a little bit because we’re not and we’ve never really talked about individual clients, individual client wins and how we onboard the revenues expenses. You’re getting at a level of, I think, specificity that’s not something we typically go into and we don’t because we want to be respectful of our clients, respectful of various positions. I think what I would tell you is and you’ve seen us with other wins describe them. We often say that there’s a range of products that come over from a client as part of a win, some come more quickly and some take more time. And I think I’ve been on record saying custody tends to come more quickly often, but not always. Accounting, middle office, Charles River takes time. And the larger the installations, the more time it takes. And you are right in your view that some of those expenses we build a bit in advance because we’ve got on board, we’ve got to do some of the professional development and technology connectivity for that. So anyway, I think you have the right outline. And I think what we’re going to to do in general is help everyone understand the momentum of our business. Part of the reason I give the quarterly guidance is to give you a little bit of insight to what we expect. And that’s all of our client activity, all of our wins, our to be installed business factors in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Deutsche Bank.\nBetsy Graseck: Ron, I had a question just around how you’re thinking about strategy in SSGA. I mean there’s been some headlines around the fact that perception that you’ve been looking at opportunities over in Europe and wanted to understand how important it is for you to gain share in Europe. And maybe you could broaden out the answer, of course, to just generally the strategy in SSGA. Could you give us a sense as to what you’re looking to do and capability adds that you’re trying to accomplish?\nRon O’Hanley: So I mean, I’ll start by just reminding everybody that asset management is a very important business for us. It’s smaller than Investment Servicing but we have quite a good business there. And as we’ve said oftentimes, we’re constantly looking at our strategy. We always look at, first, at organic opportunities to grow and second, inorganic opportunities to grow. And we’ve done a little bit of inorganic, but most of what you see in terms of the progress there has been a result of organic activities, including some of the, as I noted in my remarks, some of the recent growth in Europe. I mean I’m not going to comment on market rumors. We feel very good about the position we have and don’t feel that we have to do something at any point, but we also are looking for opportunities to exploit the position we have and to see if there’s opportunities to grow it. But it will, for us, be primarily driven by organic activities. And secondarily, if there’s something inorganic that makes sense strategically and makes sense to the shareholders then we’ll look at that.\nBetsy Graseck: And then just separately and maybe if there’s any capability sets there that you’re looking to expand into that would be helpful to understand. But just on the eye in the servicing side, we’ve also seen some announcements on servicing Bitcoin ETFs. And maybe you can give us a sense as to how long you anticipate it takes to bring that to market? And is there anything else you’re doing on the crypto side or digital currency side? In particular, are you going to be looking to service physicals or do you expect to use others to service physicals and subcustodians? Just your strategy there would be helpful to understand.\nRon O’Hanley: So there’s a lot of activity in this space and crypto means a lot. It means different things to different people. We’ve been active in certainly digital ledger and blockchain technology for a long time now. We do see this as a growing segment of the marketplace. We’ve got a number of initiatives in place to figure out how we can establish a leadership position there. I think it’s fair to say that the regulatory environment has some catching up to do here and that’s clearly on the minds of regulators, and there’s clearly lots of applications in front of them. But right now, that’s part of the gating factor. But we would view this as a trend that’s here to stay. And I think it’s a combination of how do you think about cryptocurrencies and servicing cryptocurrencies in the fullest form, not just traditional currency but administration. How do you think about in the context of an ETF? What does crypto basket creation look like? But then there’s the other side of this, it’s crypto assets, and we’re very active in thinking about how do we move from custody, something that’s physical or near physical to custodying a token. And what does that mean for us. So it’s a very, very important part of our R&D, and it’s a very, very important part of our share online now.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Betsy, I’d just add that, as Ron described, there’s a whole -- across the whole value chain, all right? There are ways for us to participate in crypto and you’ve seen us do that, announced a forth. I think we’re also very conscious of where is the white space, where are there near-term opportunities. And we think ETF, crypto ETF is an important one. Why? Because it takes something that is a bit on the side, a little bit more retail and makes it mainstream. It makes it mainstream for retail and for institutions. It increases access. And so we’re very active and you saw one announcement. We’ve got a strong pipeline of clients because these are, by and large, our clients who are innovating in crypto ETF. And while many of those need to go through a regulatory approval stage, they all need record keepers and administrators, right? The core of this is the credibility that we could bring. And we think that’s a real area of white space where we can lean in and both support our clients and also be a real important participant and player in one of the emerging spaces.\nBetsy Graseck: And when do you expect the capability will be up and running?\nEric Aboaf: The -- well, there are different capabilities, right? There’s everything from custody of the tokens itself. We often partner to do that, and we had subcustody relationships, just itself. We often partner subcustody relationships in core assets. Recordkeeping and administration is something that we have the capability today to do, which is why we’ve been appointed by several ETF providers who are in various stages of the regulatory approval process. And I’d say that’s not just appointed here in the U.S., but we have pipeline and appointments in -- around the world. Germany is a very advanced market in this space, Canada, Australia. And so -- but that record-keeping administration capability we have today and are ready to roll that out in support of our clients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin: Eric, a follow-up -- a couple of follow-up questions on the balance sheet, noticing that the investment portfolio was smaller on both period-end and average, but you had a good amount of deposit growth, so it seems like you actually have more cash sitting around today. Is that -- how do you contemplate that going forward? And are any changes in terms of how you reinvest built into your NII outlook?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Ken, good question. We always have to be mindful of the balance between NII growth driven by the investment portfolio and the amount of AOCI risk that we take, especially now that we’re in place where rates are likely to either stay flat or rise. And the question is, are we going to get a rate shock or not. So we just need to be careful of that. We took a little bit of duration off the table in the first quarter as rates rose. Remember, naturally, our MBS duration will lengthen. And so that was one of the reasons we shortened up is just to protect against that. And I think the team that we had did quite a nice job of doing that early in the quarter, and protected some of what we wanted to around AOCI here. It does put us in a position where we have some cash that we can put to work in the coming quarters that is included in our -- in the outlook that I gave and it will provide a partial offset to the long-end rate downdraft that we continue to see. But we are also at the point where the investment portfolio was resized relative to a year ago by a solid 10% larger. We did that. But it does need to have -- there’s a certain capacity that we can run. And it’s in the right range, though we may -- we will had a little bit, adjust a little bit trade around the edges to make the most with what we have.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And to that point, you did mention the episodic increase in RWA. I’m just wondering if you can help us understand how much of a weight was that on the 10.8% CET1? And I think you mentioned getting back above the target range, so just does that come back? And just wondering if this -- how much of an anomaly were the ratios this quarter outside of what we saw in OCI?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. The episodic items that I mentioned, two of them were worth about 0.5 point of CET1. So all else being equal, we printed 10.8%. We would have printed 10.2%, 10.3% if they hadn’t flowed through. flag if they come in a little heftier which might occasionally push ratios down a bit or lighter, which sometimes happens as well, which will push ratios up and that’s fine. These are just pretty typical overdrafts occasionally spike up and you spike up overdrafts $2 billion to $3 billion on the base of our balance of it having a sort of derivative positions when the dollar is in the money, strongly, we end up because the book is hedged. We have liabilities and assets in that book. We, in this case, as the dollar strengthened, we ran positive mark-to-market. But that has a -- that gets weighted heavily by the RWA standardized rules. And so you kind of had 4 -- $3 billion to $4 billion RWA move, which actually literally has remediated back over the last two weeks as the dollar move the other -- in the other direction. So anyway, just part of running the business and we’ll always have some of this volatility. But at this time, it costs us about 0.5 point on CET1, and we -- it’s reversed since\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken: Just curious on the servicing, the outlook. It seems as though there’s some -- I know that this is an imperfect way to model, but it’s the only way we got. It seems as though there’s a decent amount of B-rate compression or the relationship of AUC and AUM to revenues seems to be with revenues lagging given the outlook here and when you look at the full year, it almost suggests as though that will remain intact for the rest of the year. Is there anything specific going on? Does your outlook assume a normalization in the volume-driven components of the servicing fee piece that could be a bit of a headwind to that rate? Or is there some mix going on that’s adverse, if there’s any additional color can give, that would be really helpful.\nEric Aboaf: Sure. Brennan, I think the biggest thing that’s happening right now is that as ACA rise very significant due to equity markets and actually are offset a little bit by lower bond markets that we have that anomalous fee rate impact just because it’s not a point for point change. Remember, every 10 points of change in AUCA effectively drives a -- if it’s driven by equity markets, a three-point increase in servicing fees, right? It’s that different, which means the fee rate just naturally and just mathematically comes in lower. It’s not like the asset management business where it tends to almost be percentage linear, where 10% and 10% have played through between AUCA and servicing fees. So I think that’s the biggest item that plays through. If we look at first quarter to first quarter, the year-on-years and you’ll see that for the rest of the year. So I’d just be very careful about that just mathematical result. I think if you step back and open up the lens on servicing fees, and I think you saw we had a good result this quarter sort of seeing fees up 7% year-over-year, nominally, 4% adjusted for currency translation. I guided in second quarter that servicing fees, again, would be in that 7% to 8% range. There’ll be a few points of currency translation that again, but that’s still a very healthy growth rate. A lot of that, most of that is driven by the equity market appreciation offset by some of the bond markets, and that’s part of our business model that’s always part of our business model. And when equity markets are going south, it’s part. And when they’re going up, it’s part. So that’s the large driver right now of the revenue growth, and we think that at these levels of equity markets that we’re at, we’ve got a strong of year-on-year comparisons that we expect for second quarter and then you can -- we could model out for the year.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. And then when we think about the -- there’s this kind of a little bit of a struggle to me because I know we talked a lot about NII and the outlook, I’m going to beat this dead horse a bit. There was the update that was just sort of late in the quarter in March that seemed to suggest that things were going a little better and maybe we were getting to an inflection on NII. And then the guide here more suggests that there’s plenty to offset those green shoots. So what changed in the -- either the portfolio or in the market that would cause the delta in between the intra-quarter update and here? Because it -- LIBOR is clearly a problem, right? Short rates are they matter to you all and It seems like that’s what’s holding back some of the more constructive dynamics we’re seeing at the long end of the curve. But it seemed like we knew that when we heard the update. So was there something that happened behind the scenes that maybe we weren’t aware of that could have had the outlook maybe take a little off of the outlook or make it a little bit less constructive?\nEric Aboaf: Brennan, good question. I appreciate your being candid and direct. I think two things happened exogenously that mattered since the beginning in March when we stirred up the numbers and now. First is we’ve seen the short rates persist at a much lower level. And so I think when we were here early March, where we’re going to have one-month and three-month treasuries sit at four basis points for the rest of the quarter, rest of the year, or were they going to bounce back? And they’ve clearly sat here or been weighted down. So I think that cost us about $5 in first quarter and relative to where we would have been cost us effectively another $5 in 2Q, which means kind of $10 cumulatively in 2Q, $10 in 3Q, $10 in 4Q, so that’s not a -- I think that’s not a welcome development. Now if they bounce back, we’ll have some upside, but that’s real, and then the other one that we’re, I think, all just careful about is the attenuation of the MBS premium amortization. And I think you’ve seen a number of commentators talk about that around the industry. The last print that we all saw from the -- from Fannie, Freddie, had a small acceleration of prepayment rates instead of a downtick. And I think then by folks. But it’s hopefully the last gas on prepayment as rates have boomed up, and now we’re in burnout mode. But I think that slight one month that I’m fairly confident will be one month, it will be a -- and it’s industry-wide, it’s in the Fannie, Freddie data. I think it’s just a reminder that we don’t -- aren’t sure of the pace of the attenuation of the premium amortization in these MBS books that we all run. We just have to be careful. Obviously, if the burnout goes faster and premium amortization falls more quickly, let me tell you, I’ll be the first to signal that because I, like you and many others, are looking for not only the stabilization and we’re confident in the stabilization now. But I’d love to see better than stabilization, we’re just not quite at that point yet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Eric, can you share with us, obviously, pre-pandemic, State Street’s balance sheet deposits roughly averaged about $175 billion, and now they’re sitting around $247 billion in the current first quarter. And during this time, the Fed, of course, increased its balance sheet dramatically from about $4 trillion to over $7.5 trillion. They’re going to continue with QE, as we all know, at least through the end of the year into next year at $120 billion a month in securities purchases. Can you share with us how are you guys calibrating what kind of deposit growth you’re likely to see as the Fed continues with QE for the remainder of this year and into next year?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, it’s Eric. I think that’s the $64,000 question that many banks are wrestling with, especially as some of the rule changes happen for others on SLR and as we think about leverage ratios. And clearly, we’re in a new world. We had seen post the global financial crisis, the expansion of Fed balance sheet and then its recompression and now we’re in a new era again. I think our general view is that the pots of the banking system will roughly track the Fed monetary policy expansion, so it will do so in waves. And I think we saw that in first and second quarter of last year, we saw quite an expansion. And then we saw some flatness in deposit balances. And then as the Fed buying, offset by some of the compression in the treasury’s own portfolio, we saw some further uptick. And we’ve seen that again this year. I think we do expect continued expansion because we expect continued expansion of the Fed balance sheet, we do expect that to come back to banks. And I think from our standpoint, what we’re trying to do is be open for business for our clients, and we’d like to do that every day of the week because that’s important to them. And we’ve got some capacity to accommodate some of this growth as it comes. It’s not infinite that every day of the week because the Fed balance sheet goes up another 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, we have to see when they’re going to -- when they are going to start to constrain their own bond-buying activities slows down, pause, et cetera, we will, at the right time, to have to just work on some of our discretionary pools of deposits. We have those, and we have some capacity to adjust. We’ve got a suite of options for clients. We -- our deposit rates are at zero or near zero. So for clients, we can certainly facilitate other activities at the right point. That’s not for today or tomorrow or next quarter necessarily. It’s -- but it’s in a year or two that comes, right? We can help them sweep to money market funds. We can help them sweep to -- with treasury securities. We can help them sweep into the repo business. And so we’ll have to just navigate through. We feel pretty comfortable where we are today and in the next quarter or 2. But we’ll just have to see if there’s a wave, we’ll address, and I think we’ll just have to navigate through.\nGerard Cassidy: And just as a quick follow-up to that. Have you guys disclosed what percentage of your deposits are operational for your customers versus excess where you would have that flexibility to move those deposits maybe elsewhere?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, there is some good disclosure in some of the post quarter-end LCR type information that we and all the banks share. And we can -- I think all the banks share. And we can -- It gives different types of deposits, and it gives different kind of those different liquidity values, which starts to get at some of what you’re describing around operational versus nonoperational, so we can follow up with you.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. And then as a follow-up question, you guys are not big lenders. I understand that your loan portfolio relative to your total assets is -- or deposits is obviously quite low. But I did notice that the average loans in the quarter were down, but period-end, quarter-to-quarter, were up, I think, 13%. Any color on what drove that increase at the end of the quarter in loans?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. We’re always getting a little bit of volatility. I think one of the -- well, one of the things that we have is just overdrafts are coming through as a loan, right, as part of the book, so that’s one. And I mentioned how that, that had a spike up at the end of the quarter. The other one is there’s a good part of our loan book is the private equity firm capital call financing that we do. And that’s had a nice bit of a seasonal effect and then late in the quarter, we’ve -- as we’ve seen these funds start putting more and more capital work, we’d start to have draws on those loans, and those have started to up the -- those draws have added to the balances in a nice way, and that’s one of the reasons that we have -- we see some good continued growth in lending for us.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMike Mayo: I had a big picture question and specific question. Let’s just go with the big picture first. Originally, you were talking about converting SSGA to Charles River, and that would be a flagship client that you could use to sell to other asset managers, is that still something that’s contemplated proceeding? Do you have a time frame for that? How is that looking?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, Mike, that’s underway. And it’s proceeding exactly the way I would describe it. It’s a big complex project, so it’s been a good one to -- I mean it was client number one. We’ve obviously got a lot of other clients since then, some of them much simpler and less complex. But yes, it’s very much underway and on track.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then just more generally, as it relates to -- you said new business is neutral. And is that just the environment? Because of the pandemic, it’s tougher to knock on doors? Or is that execution that you’d like to see improve? Now you have talked about the coverage model expansion and I guess there is a -- it takes time to get that. But when you talk internally, do you say, \"Well, it’s the pandemic. It’s been tough to get new customers?\" Or do you say, \"No, you have to do better. We’re raising the bar. We’re raising the intensity.\"\nRon O’Hanley: Yes. Mike, we’ve been very open on this with you over the last few quarters. It’s the latter. Much of the natural growth in this industry is not there any longer, right? If you go back 10 years ago, more than that, much of the growth would be existing clients doing -- opening new funds, opening new fund ranges in different parts of the world. A lot of that is already accomplished. And in many cases, you’re seeing fund closures, right, as every distributor is narrowing their range. And there’s a desire for less choice, not more choice. So it absolutely is about increasing intensity, and we’re starting to see that pay off. We can talk a lot about Alpha, but the way to think about this is Alpha and front-to-back as an and, not an or, right? We still have an existing core business in which we see opportunity to increase penetration, increase penetration in medium-sized asset managers, to continue to grow, what we’re doing with asset owners and insurance companies. So it’s very much about the latter with the Alpha, particularly as we continue to land new assignments and install those as being able to provide yet a little bit more growth over the medium to long term.\nMike Mayo: And then lastly, I guess, are you nearing the bottom to -- for the NII and the fee waivers? I guess, NII, so your guidance is just a little bit lower than it was in the first quarter, right? It’s not falling off the cliff from -- unless I’m reading something wrong, and the fee waivers net $40 million worse ahead. Just if you could just clarify one more time on the NII and fee waivers? And when do you think we hit bottoms?\nEric Aboaf: Mike, it’s Eric. On NII, I think the second quarter is the bottom, and that’s why I’ve said likely to be at $460 million to $465 million per quarter for the rest of the year. So I think we’ve -- we’re at the stabilization level, plus or minus a few bucks in that, in and around that range. And given what we know today, so we think that we’re there, we’re confident we’re there. And now the question is how long is it flattish at that level? And then when does it pick up in that? I think we’ll know more in the coming quarters. And on the fee waivers, what we’ve done is forecasted what they’d be for second quarter, the net 40-ish or so offset by balances versus the net 15-or-so from first quarter. But that’s predicated on short rates being where they are today, and they’ve been kind of flattish the last 30, 45 days, and -- but that’s the assumption. We’re obviously hoping short rates stay flat or actually move up, that’s supposed to go the other way. And so it’s just based on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRob Wildhack: On the call in January, you talked about addressing sales to midsized asset managers. And so can you talk about some of the key differences? And maybe challenges between selling to a large asset manager and selling to a midsized one? And then I appreciate that it’s pretty early in that, but any update on your progress in that part of the market would be helpful, too.\nRon O’Hanley: Rob, couple of things on this, part of the sale to a medium-sized asset manager is a whole lot more standardization. It’s not to say that they don’t need customization, but we’re -- much of our success over the years was built around servicing very large asset managers. So much of what we’ve been doing has as much to do with standardizing the product as it does around adding to sales and coverage capabilities. But at the same time, we’ve recognized that how you sell and service to them, including having a way to scale up service in such a way that they’re receiving the appropriate amount of service, at a cost to serve that works for us. And again, that has required us to, in effect, establish a parallel model here and to make sure that we’re delivering expected service that we’re doing it in a way that can be done at the right unit cost for us. So -- and that work is underway. This is not a -- I mean, we’ve talked to you about this on a new problem. And at the same time, what we also want to be able to do is there’s many firms at that median level, that either through their sophistication through their range of products actually do need and can tolerate pricing was a bit of a higher service model. So a lot of this is about really understanding and segmenting the client base and getting our clients into the right bucket, if you will, and making sure that they truly are satisfied based on what their needs that they’re not underserved and they’re not overserved.\nRob Wildhack: That’s really helpful. And then earlier this year, too, you announced an expansion of business in Latin America. And I was wondering if you could talk more about the opportunity there, and the potential for international expansion, Lat-Am, and otherwise, to be a source of growth going forward?\nRon O’Hanley: Well, historically, we’ve seen a lot of our growth come from outside the U.S. Very relatively little of it, though, from Latin America, we’ve had elsewhere. We actually have a small but very loyal client base there. We’ve put a few people. This is not a massive investment on our part, but we’ve put a few very skilled veteran people covering that market now, and we’re already seeing some really attractive green shoots. So we see this as a medium- to long-term opportunity. Activity is already happening, even though we’re less than a year into this intensified effort. And so we see it as a nice supplement to what we already have in place in EMEA and APAC.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, Ron and Eric, a couple of questions for you, folks. Asset management fees, which were down about 1% linked quarter ex FX translation. You mentioned that it was due to client asset reallocation. What was that? And was it a onetime thing? Or -- and how much of an impact did that have?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, Vivek, it’s -- I would describe it as idiosyncratic is maybe the best way to describe it. It was an extremely large client, a corporate pension fund and was doing what a lot of corporate pension funds are doing these days, right, derisking. So move from quite high up on the fee schedule to a much more of a derisked environment as a result of their asset allocation. I mean that’s a trend that we’ve seen. That’s not new, but the fact that it happens is such a very lower plant that was a very big or it’s gone, ask it all content allocation before them, made it show up in our results the way it has.\nVivek Juneja: Eric, one for you, just a follow-on to an earlier question on NII growth in your liquid assets and your securities on an average basis were flattish linked quarter. What level of rates do you want to see before you’re willing to move some of this liquidity into higher-yielding securities? Or is there something else that would drive you to do that, Eric?\nEric Aboaf: There really, Vivek, it’s Eric. There really two -- probably, two or three triggers or break points for us. I think one is the outright level of rates in -- we’ve seen some good movement in 10, we’ve not seen that much movement in 5s. And so the question is a little bit, when does the curve more broadly move because we -- while we’d like to put more money to work, we need to be a little careful of our duration because with duration comes AOCI volatility. And so it’s and so it’s curve that would be good to see. And right now, 5s are in the, whatever, 85, 90 basis point range, it’d be nice to see them a good bit higher. And 10s, for 10s to pay off, either in clean duration treasuries or an MBS, we need higher rates, a good bit higher before where we’re on to make that trade at the right levels of higher rates, you get the benefit if rates were to come down off a positive AOCI, so that’s helpful. But we’re not at that level where we -- everything great is going to come back down very quickly. And so we actually need more of an upswing before we really lean into the trade. It doesn’t mean we won’t trade around the edges and trade the slope and so forth, but that’s probably a little bit of framing that might help.\nVivek Juneja: One quick one. Just -- you had legal and other costs of $29 million, but I noticed $28 million of it was in transaction processing and info systems. Can you give a little color on what was involved there?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Vivek, this was a legacy matter that dates a number of years ago. There were some costs that we, at this time, thought were reimbursable that were by either clients or other partners that we had. They did accumulate on the balance sheet, and we came to the conclusion recently that they’re not reimbursable. And so effectively, they need to be expensed, and so we cleaned up the books here. But it dates back a number of years, and we made the adjustment accordingly. And then I don’t know if Ken is still on, operator, but just to clarify, I misspoke a little bit on his RWA question. RWA was up, as I said, for -- in an episodic way about $5 billion or $6 billion this quarter. Had it not been up, our $10.8 million CET1 ratio would have been in the 11.2% to 11.3% range.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar.\nRajiv Bhatia: Just a quick question. For Charles River, can you comment on your competitive environment and retention trends? And how much of your new wins is from competitive takeaway versus firms deciding to outsource?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes. I mean in terms of the competitiveness of the product, I mean, it’s competitive. I mean it’s -- you can look at it through its -- both its penetration. You can look at it when you lay it alongside our other competitors just in terms of the R&D and the software development we’ve put into it. In terms of the new business achieved, it tends to be a mix. And in many cases, it’s replacing the proprietary OMSs or risk analytics systems or systems that were put in that really aren’t being supported anymore. That tends to be most of it. And I think that tends to be most of it for our big competitors. There’s a little bit of takeaway going on, typically, when somebody is doing some consolidating, but it’s not so much takeaway as it is replacing something proprietary or something that’s just no longer being supported. Which is, by the way, what makes the market attractive versus inherent growth in the market as opposed to duking it out with existing strong competitors.\nRajiv Bhatia: Got it. So like your double-digit growth outlook, that doesn’t necessarily much like competitive displacement?\nRon O’Hanley: No.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is open.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Just two quick questions for Eric kind of around the guidance. More clarification questions here. On that full year fee revenue guidance that you gave, was that inclusive or exclusive of the money market fee waivers?\nEric Aboaf: That was inclusive. So it’s all in guidance. It covers all the ins and outs of the business, including the update on money market fees.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Okay. And then also on the guidance, 2Q and full year, were you giving that as of where the equity markets were as of quarter end or as of today, obviously, the move in the markets quarter-to-date thus far?\nEric Aboaf: I think I’ve split the difference on that. It’s -- the market’s moved so much, we’re trying to give some directional guidance. I think the -- for equity markets, we’re still assuming the point-to-point increase in the period last year and the period this year of 10 percentage points. We’ll see if that stays or not, given where we are, and we wrote this over the last week.

            "name": "Ron O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the environment we're operating in today as compared to this time last year and then highlight some of the data that evidence the progress we are making towards enhancing and improving our operating model and innovating across our franchise all the while being an essential partner for our clients. Relative to the first quarter of 2020, the first three months of 2021 could hardly be more different. Economic activity is sharply rebounding, unemployment is declining and equity markets have recovered strongly from the crisis levels experienced in 2020. Although, short end rates remain at historically low levels, long end US bond yields are rebounding. While COVID-19 infection and death rates remain stubbornly high in many parts of the world, there is clearly light at the end of this pandemic tunnel. The owners and managers of the world's capital are also looking to the future into the next stage of growth. As the economy and financial markets continue to recover and investment inflows continue to grow, we remain focused on delivering for our clients across segments and regions. As demonstrated by our first quarter financial results, State Street continued to successfully navigate the improving operating environment. Although, as I noted, short term interest rates, which compressed further during the first quarter, remain a critical headwind for our industry. While we cannot control interest rates, we are resolutely focused on implementing our strategy and pivoting our business to being more of an enterprise outsourced solutions provider, underpinned by the ongoing development and delivery of our State Street Alpha front to back platform. And we look forward with confidence for a number of reasons. First, we further built upon our reputation for reliability during the crisis and our clients know they can depend on us to deliver the services and market solutions they need in good times and in bad. Second, throughout the crisis, we continue to invest in further strengthening and distinguishing our global operating model, client service and operational resiliency, which has been apparent to and noted by our clients. Third, many clients are reassessing their own operating models. And as a result, we have the opportunity to take on more of their operations and data activities, allowing them to focus on creating better investment outcomes for their clients. Fourth, our employees continue to perform at very high levels despite a year of largely remote work and disrupted routines. I am grateful for their extraordinary dedication and service. Last, both our Alpha and non-Alpha institutional servicing value propositions continue to resonate and enjoy take up as demonstrated by some recent announcements. For example, we reported an additional three State Street Alpha clients during the first quarter and separately this morning, we announced the full front to back Alpha relationship with Invesco, adding front and middle office services to our existing back office mandates. Through the open architecture nature of our operating platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships, unlocking new sources of revenue and strengthening the interoperability element of our Alpha value proposition, which is appealing to clients. After quarter end, we announced that M&G has appointed us to provide outsource middle office services in addition to our existing fund accounting company services. State Street will administer the middle office services on Aladdin, exemplifying how we offer clients the benefit of choice regarding their front end and middle office systems. These deals highlight how we are uniquely positioned to win front to back mandates as well as to win new business as a result of interoperable nature of our operating platform. While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our strategy, we also continue to innovate across our franchise. For example, a growing demand exists for ESG solutions that will provide the necessary data, risk analytics and reporting capabilities at scale. To that end, during the first quarter we introduced enhancements to our ESG solutions that can now provide clients with the ability to address new global ESG regulatory requirements for a single platform. Global Advisors' new US corporate ESG ETF launched in EMEA in late 2020 and grew to $5.4 billion of AUM by the end of the first quarter, making it the largest corporate bond ESG funds in the use of space. We also continue to develop our digital asset strategy as we prepare to deploy our capabilities and servicing [Technical Difficulty]. We recently announced our intention to serve as the VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF. Subject to regulatory approval, we will work with VanEck to provide services, including ETF basket operations, custody of the ETF shares on the counting order taking and transfer agency in multiple jurisdictions. Next, I will review our first quarter highlights before handing the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Turning to Slide 3. First quarter EPS was $1.37 or $1.47 excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago period, first quarter total revenue declined 4%, driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, total fee revenue increased 4%, driven by servicing and management fee growth, which increased 7% and 6% year-over-year respectively, as well as an improved software and processing fee performance. Collectively, these more than offset the year-over-year headwind from FX trading as compared to the exceptionally strong first quarter of trading last year. While our FX trading revenues are down year-over-year, first quarter revenue remains well above pandemic levels as a result of higher client volumes and the investment we have made in our platforms and talent in recent [Technical Difficulty]. Even with rising total fee revenue, first quarter total expenses were essentially flat year-over-year, excluding notable items and currency translation as productivity improvements are paying off. Furthermore, we have successfully reduced high cost location headcount relative to the period one year ago. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to control core operating expenses over the remainder of 2021. At the end of the first quarter, AUC/A and AUM both increase to record levels supported by higher period end markets. AUC/A increased to $40.3 trillion, new asset servicing wins were a solid $343 billion, while servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods amounted to $463 billion at quarter end. Global Advisors' AUM increased to $3.6 trillion and also benefited from a very strong flow performance in ETFs and a solid performance in the cash business. At CRD, annual recurring revenue increased 14% to $225 million and we remain pleased with how the business is performing while also enabling our Alpha strategy. Overall, we had a strong start to the year and remain confident that we have a clear path to our medium term targets discussed in January. To conclude, we continued to successfully navigate and distinguish ourselves in a fluid [Technical Difficulty] moving operating environment as demonstrated by our first quarter results. We remain focused on further developing and growing our Alpha [offline] and are pleased with the recent client activity. Meanwhile, we also continue to innovate across and grow many areas of our franchise. During the first quarter, we returned $659 million of capital to our shareholders through a combination of common share repurchases and common dividends. For the second quarter of 2021, our Board has authorized up to 425 million of common stock repurchases consistent with the limit set by the FED.  And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Eric. And operator, we can now open the call for questions. Why don't I just add to that, the second part of your question, I think what you're basically asking is how does Alpha fit in all this and how does it change those numbers? Clearly, we're pleased with the progress with Alpha 3 reported wins in the first quarter. And as we noted, one that we reported already for the second quarter, about a third of our business to be installed, the $463 billion to be installed is Alpha related and we would expect that to grow just given some of the things that we've talked about. What that means, though, is these are longer installations. Remember, in effect, we're becoming the enterprise outsourcer to these clients. So it will be nice revenue impact but we're talking about 2022 and 2023 revenue impact relatively little of that, certainly the things that we reported for the first quarter will we see in 2021. So I mean, I'll start by just reminding everybody that asset management is a very important business for us. It's smaller than Investment Servicing but we have quite a good business there. And as we've said oftentimes, we're constantly looking at our strategy. We always look at, first, at organic opportunities to grow and second, inorganic opportunities to grow. And we've done a little bit of inorganic, but most of what you see in terms of the progress there has been a result of organic activities, including some of the, as I noted in my remarks, some of the recent growth in Europe. I mean I'm not going to comment on market rumors. We feel very good about the position we have and don't feel that we have to do something at any point, but we also are looking for opportunities to exploit the position we have and to see if there's opportunities to grow it. But it will, for us, be primarily driven by organic activities. And secondarily, if there's something inorganic that makes sense strategically and makes sense to the shareholders then we'll look at that. So there's a lot of activity in this space and crypto means a lot. It means different things to different people. We've been active in certainly digital ledger and blockchain technology for a long time now. We do see this as a growing segment of the marketplace. We've got a number of initiatives in place to figure out how we can establish a leadership position there. I think it's fair to say that the regulatory environment has some catching up to do here and that's clearly on the minds of regulators, and there's clearly lots of applications in front of them. But right now, that's part of the gating factor. But we would view this as a trend that's here to stay. And I think it's a combination of how do you think about cryptocurrencies and servicing cryptocurrencies in the fullest form, not just traditional currency but administration. How do you think about in the context of an ETF? What does crypto basket creation look like? But then there's the other side of this, it's crypto assets, and we're very active in thinking about how do we move from custody, something that's physical or near physical to custodying a token. And what does that mean for us. So it's a very, very important part of our R&D, and it's a very, very important part of our share online now. Yes, Mike, that's underway. And it's proceeding exactly the way I would describe it. It's a big complex project, so it's been a good one to -- I mean it was client number one. We've obviously got a lot of other clients since then, some of them much simpler and less complex. But yes, it's very much underway and on track. Yes. Mike, we've been very open on this with you over the last few quarters. It's the latter. Much of the natural growth in this industry is not there any longer, right? If you go back 10 years ago, more than that, much of the growth would be existing clients doing -- opening new funds, opening new fund ranges in different parts of the world. A lot of that is already accomplished. And in many cases, you're seeing fund closures, right, as every distributor is narrowing their range. And there's a desire for less choice, not more choice. So it absolutely is about increasing intensity, and we're starting to see that pay off. We can talk a lot about Alpha, but the way to think about this is Alpha and front-to-back as an and, not an or, right? We still have an existing core business in which we see opportunity to increase penetration, increase penetration in medium-sized asset managers, to continue to grow, what we're doing with asset owners and insurance companies. So it's very much about the latter with the Alpha, particularly as we continue to land new assignments and install those as being able to provide yet a little bit more growth over the medium to long term. Rob, couple of things on this, part of the sale to a medium-sized asset manager is a whole lot more standardization. It's not to say that they don't need customization, but we're -- much of our success over the years was built around servicing very large asset managers. So much of what we've been doing has as much to do with standardizing the product as it does around adding to sales and coverage capabilities. But at the same time, we've recognized that how you sell and service to them, including having a way to scale up service in such a way that they're receiving the appropriate amount of service, at a cost to serve that works for us. And again, that has required us to, in effect, establish a parallel model here and to make sure that we're delivering expected service that we're doing it in a way that can be done at the right unit cost for us. So -- and that work is underway. This is not a -- I mean, we've talked to you about this on a new problem. And at the same time, what we also want to be able to do is there's many firms at that median level, that either through their sophistication through their range of products actually do need and can tolerate pricing was a bit of a higher service model. So a lot of this is about really understanding and segmenting the client base and getting our clients into the right bucket, if you will, and making sure that they truly are satisfied based on what their needs that they're not underserved and they're not overserved. Well, historically, we've seen a lot of our growth come from outside the U.S. Very relatively little of it, though, from Latin America, we've had elsewhere. We actually have a small but very loyal client base there. We've put a few people. This is not a massive investment on our part, but we've put a few very skilled veteran people covering that market now, and we're already seeing some really attractive green shoots. So we see this as a medium- to long-term opportunity. Activity is already happening, even though we're less than a year into this intensified effort. And so we see it as a nice supplement to what we already have in place in EMEA and APAC. Yes, Vivek, it's -- I would describe it as idiosyncratic is maybe the best way to describe it. It was an extremely large client, a corporate pension fund and was doing what a lot of corporate pension funds are doing these days, right, derisking. So move from quite high up on the fee schedule to a much more of a derisked environment as a result of their asset allocation. I mean that's a trend that we've seen. That's not new, but the fact that it happens is such a very lower plant that was a very big or it's gone, ask it all content allocation before them, made it show up in our results the way it has. Yes. I mean in terms of the competitiveness of the product, I mean, it's competitive. I mean it's -- you can look at it through its -- both its penetration. You can look at it when you lay it alongside our other competitors just in terms of the R&D and the software development we've put into it. In terms of the new business achieved, it tends to be a mix. And in many cases, it's replacing the proprietary OMSs or risk analytics systems or systems that were put in that really aren't being supported anymore. That tends to be most of it. And I think that tends to be most of it for our big competitors. There's a little bit of takeaway going on, typically, when somebody is doing some consolidating, but it's not so much takeaway as it is replacing something proprietary or something that's just no longer being supported. Which is, by the way, what makes the market attractive versus inherent growth in the market as opposed to duking it out with existing strong competitors. No. Thank you, operator, and thanks to all for your questions. Thanks for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you throughout the quarter."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.37 or $1.47 excluding the impact from notable items, which amounted to $0.10 in the first quarter as detailed in the panel on the right side of the slide. On the left to the slide, you can see that we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth while expenses were well controlled despite higher market values and client volumes. As a result of the depreciating dollar relative to the year ago period, we also show our first quarter results excluding the impact of currency translation in the column to the right. Total fee revenue was up almost 4% year-over-year or up 2% excluding the impact of currency translation despite the significantly year-on-year headwind from the exceptional FX trading services results we had in the first quarter of last year due to the pandemic. For context, total fee revenue excluding FX trading services was up 9% year-on-year or 7% excluding the impact of currency translation with strong mid single digit growth in servicing fees, management fees and securities finance. Expenses were roughly flat year-on-year excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation, which you can see at the bottom of the slide. So in total this was a solid quarter, demonstrating the progress we're making, improving our operating model as we drive towards growth. Turning to Slide 5, you'll see strong business volume growth across the franchise. Period end AUC/A increased 26% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to a record $40 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client flows and net new business growth. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increase the result of higher period end equity market levels, better client flows and net new business, which more than offset the impact of lower bond markets. We're seeing that both retail and institutional investors have moved off the sidelines and we're seeing inflows globally across most product types that we now custody. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 34% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to $3.6 trillion, also a record. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net ETF and cash inflows. Our ETF franchise had a strong flow performance again as the US ETF industry experience record flows. Spider net inflows amounted to over $23 billion in the first quarter with both sectors and industries and low costs doing particularly well. Turning to Slide 6. First quarter servicing fees increased 7% year-on-year, including currency translation, which was worth approximately 3 percentage points year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average market levels and normal pricing headwind. Servicing fees were also up 5% quarter-on-quarter as a result of the higher average market levels and stronger client activity. This quarter, we saw good growth in asset managers, alternatives and official institutions. I'm pleased with how 2021 has started as the first quarter AUC/A wins totaled a solid $343 billion, which is up from recent quarters. And for context, last quarter you heard me outline that we need approximately $1.5 billion of annual gross sales volumes in order to drive net underlying growth, which means offsetting typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds in our servicing business. I'm also pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of client segments and deal sizes with an attractive overall fee rate as we continue to work on generating broad based growth across our clients, segments and regions. As an example, you may have also seen that earlier in the quarter we announced that we have assumed that depository bank and fund administrative activities of a subsidiary of Intesa Sanpaolo in Europe. AUC/A 1 but yet to be installed amounted to $463 billion at quarter end. Positively, both are reported wins and to be installed numbers exclude the two recently announced mandates, which Ron mentioned just a moment ago, as these deals were signed after the end of the first quarter. Turning to Slide 7, let me discuss several other [important] fee revenue lines in more detail. First quarter management fees were $493 million, up 6% year-on-year, including 2% impact from currency translation but were flat quarter-on-quarter. Both our year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee performance has benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong flow performance within our ETF and cash businesses, partially offset by an idiosyncratic client asset reallocation from higher fee products as well as money market fee waivers. Regarding money market fee waivers, we had about $15 million this quarter and we expect that they will increase given the significant downward move in short end rates in March. If they persist, we expect company wide impact could be around $50 million to $55 million per quarter for the rest of the year beginning in 2Q and of distribution fee, though higher balances should be worth roughly $10 million to $15 million per quarter, leaving the net impact closer to $40 million per quarter. FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the exceptional first quarter of 2020, FX trading revenue fell 22% year-on-year but it was up 7% quarter-on-quarter with higher volumes across both developed and emerging market currency pairs. While FX market volatility declined relative to the fourth quarter, we continue to see higher client volumes as our FX business continued to benefit from many years of investment across six venues and now 47 markets, three of which we added and two of which we expanded in the last year alone. Our securities finance business recorded its second consecutive quarter of good revenue growth, increasing 8% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of [higher] enhanced custody balances driven by new mandates from alternative clients and increase in fixed income assets on loan within our agency lending program. Finally, our first quarter software and processing fees were up 55% year-on-year and down 15% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to changes in mark-to-market adjustments. Moving to Slide 8, we have here CRD standalone revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated CRD revenues into three categories to help to see through the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the revenue recognition accounting rules for on premise revenue. Total CRD revenues increased 4% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher software enabled revenue and was 10% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely due to seasonally higher on premise revenues in the fourth quarter. As shown on the Slide, the more durable SaaS and professional services revenues increased by a strong 21% combined growth rate relative to the year ago period. On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the first quarter highlights of State Street Alpha. We reported an additional three Alpha clients during the first quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate with our client base, and this doesn't include this morning's first quarter and quarter end announcement. The Alpha pipeline continues to remain promising as the economic disruption in the last year has helped clients realize the transformational potential of the Alpha platform for their technology and operations infrastructure. Turning to Slide 9. First quarter NII declined 30% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of the low interest rate environment on our investment portfolio and the absence of $20 million market related benefits in the first quarter of 2020. Quarter-on-quarter, NII declined 6% as expected. Around 3% of the sequential quarter decline was due to the impact of lower long end rates on our investment portfolio despite a sequential improvement in premium amortization. Approximately 1 percentage point of the sequential decline was due to just a half quarter's downdraft in short end rates on our sponsored member repo activity, and the rest was due to the lumpier items, including day count. These impacts were partially offset by higher deposit balances as you can see on the right of the slide. Total average deposits increased by $20 billion in the first quarter or an increase of 10% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of the Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policy. We remain mindful of OCI risk to our capital. So as the US Treasury sold off dramatically during the first quarter, we gently trimmed the investment portfolio and may selectively reinvest a bit over the coming months at higher rates. Turning to Slide 10, we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex notables, so that the underlying trends are clearly evident. Excluding notable items, first quarter expenses increased 2% year-on-year which is all driven by the weaker dollar, which means we effectively held underlying expenses flat year-on-year. On a line item basis, compensation employee benefits was up only 1% excluding the impact of currency translation as higher seasonal expenses were partially offset by reduction in headcount in higher cost locations. Information systems and communication expenses were up 3% excluding the impact of currency translation due to higher software costs and continued investment in our technology estate. Transaction processing expenses were up just 1% ex FX as our savings initiatives offset significant volume based growth in subcustody and market data costs. Occupancy and other expenses were both down several points. Relative to the fourth quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal and deferred compensation. Overall, I'm pleased with the underlying expense performance in the first quarter as we absorbed approximately $15 million of variable revenue related costs. We continue to demonstrate operating model improvements as we drive increased productivity through automation, reengineering and scale. Moving to Slide 11, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the improving operating environment with strong capital levels. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio was up slightly year-on-year but fell 1.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 10.8%. Relative to the fourth quarter, our capital base was impacted by lower AOCI as a result of the significant run up in long end US treasury yields as well as by an increase in intangibles related to the recently announced lift up deal we completed with Intesa Sanpaolo. We also saw $6 billion increase in episodic RWA, primarily related to FX trading and overdraft activity. This RWA headwind was transient in nature and has already declined by $5 billion. So at the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio will be over 11%, all else being equal. Tier 1 leverage was down year-over-year and fell by 1 percentage point quarter-on-quarter to 5.4%, primarily as a result of higher average assets, driven by the increase in quarterly average deposit balances as well as the AOCI change and the $500 million partial call for Series F preferred securities announced in January. As you can see on the slide and as I mentioned previously, we continue to consider a CET1 target range of 10% to 11% as appropriate level of capital for our business. Further, we consider that a Tier 1 leverage ratio between 5.25% and 5.75% as also being appropriate for our business model and can comfortably operate in this quarter this year even with the recent growth in deposits. Last, as we look ahead and as Ron noted, for the second quarter of 2020, our Board has authorized up to $425 million of common stock repurchases consistent with the limit set by the Fed. Turning to Slide 12, we provide a summary of our first quarter results. Despite the continued headwind from historically low interest rates, I am pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our business as well as the progress we are making within our institutional services franchise. Total fee revenue was up almost 4% year-on-year, including the significant year-on-year headwind from the exceptional FX trading services result we had in the first quarter of last year. And excluding FX trading services, total fee revenue was up 9% year-over-year or 7% excluding the impact of currency translation with solid mid single digit growth across servicing fees, management fees and sec lending. And with that strong top line fee growth, expenses were well controlled and were held roughly flat year-over-year excluding notable items and the headwind from foreign currency translation, demonstrating the progress we're making in improving our operating model. Next, I would like to update our full year economic outlook and provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter. At a macro level, our full year interest rate outlook assumes that short end rates remain pressured and there is some modest steeping of the yield curve, in line with the current forwards, which suggests modestly improving premium amortization so the pace of improvement remains uncertain. We're also now assuming global equity markets will be flattish to the current levels for the rest of the year or up around 10% point-to-point from the beginning of 2021 as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility. In terms of the second quarter of 2021, our guide includes about 2 percentage points of currency tailwinds for fee revenue and 2 percentage points of headwinds for expenses. So we expect that overall fee revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year depending on equity market levels with servicing and management fees up 7% to 8% as we anniversary a strong 2Q 2020 in FX trading and CRD. Regarding NII, given the impact of historically low short end rates as well as the impact of long end rates in our investment portfolio, we now expect NII to run around $460 million to $465 million per quarter from here in 2021, assuming premium amortization continues to attenuate. Turning to expenses. We remain laser focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs. We expect that second quarter expenses ex notable items will be up around 2.5% year-over-year or relatively flat ex currency translation with some potential for variability due to the revenue related costs. On taxes, we expect that the 2Q ‘21 tax rate will be towards the upper end of our full year range of 17% to 19%. While it is still early in the year, we are taking up our full year fee revenue guide again and now expect full year fee revenue to be up 2.5% to 4%. We also expect that slightly higher revenue related variable costs will add about 50 basis points to our prior full year expense guide of flat to down 1% ex notable items. Just remember, there's a solid point of FX translation in these full year fees and full year expense guides. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Let me start on the quarter and then we'll talk a little more about the momentum in the business. I think we felt like we had a solid quarter here. As you saw, servicing fees were up 7% year-over-year in aggregate. I mentioned about 3 percentage points of that was just currency translation. So the underlying growth was around 4%. If we were to decompose the 4% and you know there's always a mix of items here, the largest positive driver was equity market appreciation. So equity market appreciation across the low equity markets were up north of 20% on average. That translated to about 6% tailwind in servicing fees for the quarter. And then against that we had the normalized amount of -- the normal amount of fee headwinds of about 2%, which brought us down to the net 4%. So it was a good quarter. I think what we continue to focus on is there tends to be some tailwind in our model from flows and client activity. This quarter we had some of that but we also had it a year ago in a good amount, so that was relatively neutral on a year-on-year basis. And then the other component is net new business. And as I've said I think pretty clearly, we have had lighter sales quarters over the last four to six quarters. We need to take that up. And as that happens, we'll be in a position to have net new business growth. For the time being, net new business is relatively neutral, which is okay but not enough and not at the levels that we'd like to be and that's, I think, partly why we have been real clear around the amount of net new business we need to win. We've been actioning that on a segment basis or regional basis. You've heard about our coverage model expansion. All those are components of that acceleration, which I think are well along and starting to show some positive results as I highlighted and asset managers, for example, an alternative and that I think will be to our advantage in the coming time periods. We're on the capital return plan that's largely driven by our common equity Tier 1 ratios, which had some volatility this quarter but are still solidly above, I think, or we'll return solidly above the range. So we've got confidence in what we can do there. On Tier 1 leverage, there are probably a couple of different aspects of that matter. I think, first, we'd like to operate in this quarter of 5.25% to 5.75%. And we have some little more room in the balance sheet to -- if we get pushed on deposits. But as you remember, we also have some ability to adjust that. If you recall, we added some discretionary deposits over the last two year time period, and those are in the $10 billion, $15 billion, $20 billion range, so there's some tactical ways we can accommodate clients and then continue to manage the size of the overall balance sheet. I think we certainly have an ability occasionally to move outside and below the range on the 5.25% if we're the right way around. And right now, it's right way risk, so to speak, because it's clients rather is coming to us because of the strength of our brand, that's pushing that ratio. And so we can always do that for a quarter or two if necessary. And so part of what we're very mindful of is how do we continue to support our clients during this time of fed easing. And so there are ways to navigate through that during the year, and we kind of see that as just part of our normal business activity. A couple of things just to keep in mind first. First quarter every year is always our low point on margin and ROE because of the seasonal deferred incentive compensation expenses. So those come through and then we've got to take a full year look. So I'd just be a little cautious on that. I think more broadly in terms of ROE that's really a focus. I think you've seen in our proxy over the last few years, ROE has a management target. We added margin to that and now fee revenue. So we're incredibly focused on those three major leverage points. And I've got to tell you I've got entire management team who's thinking about those every month and every quarter. I think the way I think about ROE is probably from a couple of perspectives in terms of its trajectory. I think, first, continued work on margin. And this year, we're just trying to hold margins steady, notwithstanding given the falling interest rates. But you've seen us actually hold expenses flat and fee revenues up. That is going to, over time, extend margin and filter back into ROE and every 2 points of expansion in margin is a point of ROE. So there's real, I think, flow through there. And then I think the second one you hinted is around capital return. We're very pleased to return 100% of earnings this year, this quarter, in the first quarter, in line with the fed limits. We've done that again in second quarter. And we're committed to a pattern of capital return as a way to return capital to investors and to drive up ROE. And so I think there's a path in that way as well. I think the good news here is while we have some fee, money market fee waivers, we don't have the size of money market fee waivers that others are seeing around the industry just because of the more institutional nature of our money market complex. So I think that's some context to help with. The money market fee waivers are effectively driven by short end rates. It could be everything from overnight repo to one month and three month treasuries. And effectively, as one and three month treasuries fell from kind of 8 basis points, 9 basis points down to 3 basis points, 4 basis points and 5 basis points in March, you're starting to get to the point where the reinvestment rate against the management fee rate starts to be inflected. And as a result, we are at that pressure point. And literally, the 4 basis points or 5 basis point move at the point does have the impact as you've seen. I think the good news here is we've continuously cash inflows into our complex, part of that comes from the easing and the monitory policy that we're seeing. Part of that is, I think, we have an attractive set of offerings. And I'll tell you that that's all been factored into our guide and part of what we're managing through. I think the best way to understand it is the short rates had an impact in the first quarter, and then we'll now have three months worth of that in the second quarter, so that's what drives the the additional nudge down from what we would have preferred to have seen. On long end rates, long end rates have been a headwind all through last year as they came down, and now even at this current level are a headwind for the portfolio. They were a headwind in the portfolio, for example, from 4Q to 1Q by about 5 points of NII, but has started to work against the long end rate impact is premium amortization, which has started to come down and that was actually a tailwind sequentially of about 2 points of NII. And so you're kind of having this continued headwind from long end rates, which just has to play through. Remember, the average duration of the portfolio is about three years. Think about when long rates were -- when the rate cycle started was a year ago, so there's another year of long end rates being a headwind. What we're now looking for is the premium amortization to slow down. Now we need to be careful about the pace of that slowing down, but that is expected to slow based on the various models, and that starts to create a partial offset to those long end rate headwinds. And what we're looking for is the crossover point. And we think sometime in the second half of this year, long end rates will still be a headwind but premium amortization should begin to offset that and thus, the collection of those two will be roughly neutral. And that's effectively why we don't see an uptick because that long end rate headwind just continues on effectively for that two to three year time period that has to flow through the books. And what we need to see over time is for premium amortization to fall substantially enough so that there is some uplift. We just don't see that happening this year. And I think the question is how and when that begins to turn. And what I'm trying to do is avoid getting out ahead of us because we just need to see it play out, and I think we'll know more in the coming couple of quarters. Brian, let me just step back a little bit because we're not and we've never really talked about individual clients, individual client wins and how we onboard the revenues expenses. You're getting at a level of, I think, specificity that's not something we typically go into and we don't because we want to be respectful of our clients, respectful of various positions. I think what I would tell you is and you've seen us with other wins describe them. We often say that there's a range of products that come over from a client as part of a win, some come more quickly and some take more time. And I think I've been on record saying custody tends to come more quickly often, but not always. Accounting, middle office, Charles River takes time. And the larger the installations, the more time it takes. And you are right in your view that some of those expenses we build a bit in advance because we've got on board, we've got to do some of the professional development and technology connectivity for that. So anyway, I think you have the right outline. And I think what we're going to to do in general is help everyone understand the momentum of our business. Part of the reason I give the quarterly guidance is to give you a little bit of insight to what we expect. And that's all of our client activity, all of our wins, our to be installed business factors in. Yes. Betsy, I'd just add that, as Ron described, there's a whole -- across the whole value chain, all right? There are ways for us to participate in crypto and you've seen us do that, announced a forth. I think we're also very conscious of where is the white space, where are there near-term opportunities. And we think ETF, crypto ETF is an important one. Why? Because it takes something that is a bit on the side, a little bit more retail and makes it mainstream. It makes it mainstream for retail and for institutions. It increases access. And so we're very active and you saw one announcement. We've got a strong pipeline of clients because these are, by and large, our clients who are innovating in crypto ETF. And while many of those need to go through a regulatory approval stage, they all need record keepers and administrators, right? The core of this is the credibility that we could bring. And we think that's a real area of white space where we can lean in and both support our clients and also be a real important participant and player in one of the emerging spaces. The -- well, there are different capabilities, right? There's everything from custody of the tokens itself. We often partner to do that, and we had subcustody relationships, just itself. We often partner subcustody relationships in core assets. Recordkeeping and administration is something that we have the capability today to do, which is why we've been appointed by several ETF providers who are in various stages of the regulatory approval process. And I'd say that's not just appointed here in the U.S., but we have pipeline and appointments in -- around the world. Germany is a very advanced market in this space, Canada, Australia. And so -- but that record-keeping administration capability we have today and are ready to roll that out in support of our clients. Yes. Ken, good question. We always have to be mindful of the balance between NII growth driven by the investment portfolio and the amount of AOCI risk that we take, especially now that we're in place where rates are likely to either stay flat or rise. And the question is, are we going to get a rate shock or not. So we just need to be careful of that. We took a little bit of duration off the table in the first quarter as rates rose. Remember, naturally, our MBS duration will lengthen. And so that was one of the reasons we shortened up is just to protect against that. And I think the team that we had did quite a nice job of doing that early in the quarter, and protected some of what we wanted to around AOCI here. It does put us in a position where we have some cash that we can put to work in the coming quarters that is included in our -- in the outlook that I gave and it will provide a partial offset to the long-end rate downdraft that we continue to see. But we are also at the point where the investment portfolio was resized relative to a year ago by a solid 10% larger. We did that. But it does need to have -- there's a certain capacity that we can run. And it's in the right range, though we may -- we will had a little bit, adjust a little bit trade around the edges to make the most with what we have. Yes. The episodic items that I mentioned, two of them were worth about 0.5 point of CET1. So all else being equal, we printed 10.8%. We would have printed 10.2%, 10.3% if they hadn't flowed through. flag if they come in a little heftier which might occasionally push ratios down a bit or lighter, which sometimes happens as well, which will push ratios up and that's fine. These are just pretty typical overdrafts occasionally spike up and you spike up overdrafts $2 billion to $3 billion on the base of our balance of it having a sort of derivative positions when the dollar is in the money, strongly, we end up because the book is hedged. We have liabilities and assets in that book. We, in this case, as the dollar strengthened, we ran positive mark-to-market. But that has a -- that gets weighted heavily by the RWA standardized rules. And so you kind of had 4 -- $3 billion to $4 billion RWA move, which actually literally has remediated back over the last two weeks as the dollar move the other -- in the other direction. So anyway, just part of running the business and we'll always have some of this volatility. But at this time, it costs us about 0.5 point on CET1, and we -- it's reversed since Sure. Brennan, I think the biggest thing that's happening right now is that as ACA rise very significant due to equity markets and actually are offset a little bit by lower bond markets that we have that anomalous fee rate impact just because it's not a point for point change. Remember, every 10 points of change in AUCA effectively drives a -- if it's driven by equity markets, a three-point increase in servicing fees, right? It's that different, which means the fee rate just naturally and just mathematically comes in lower. It's not like the asset management business where it tends to almost be percentage linear, where 10% and 10% have played through between AUCA and servicing fees. So I think that's the biggest item that plays through. If we look at first quarter to first quarter, the year-on-years and you'll see that for the rest of the year. So I'd just be very careful about that just mathematical result. I think if you step back and open up the lens on servicing fees, and I think you saw we had a good result this quarter sort of seeing fees up 7% year-over-year, nominally, 4% adjusted for currency translation. I guided in second quarter that servicing fees, again, would be in that 7% to 8% range. There'll be a few points of currency translation that again, but that's still a very healthy growth rate. A lot of that, most of that is driven by the equity market appreciation offset by some of the bond markets, and that's part of our business model that's always part of our business model. And when equity markets are going south, it's part. And when they're going up, it's part. So that's the large driver right now of the revenue growth, and we think that at these levels of equity markets that we're at, we've got a strong of year-on-year comparisons that we expect for second quarter and then you can -- we could model out for the year. Brennan, good question. I appreciate your being candid and direct. I think two things happened exogenously that mattered since the beginning in March when we stirred up the numbers and now. First is we've seen the short rates persist at a much lower level. And so I think when we were here early March, where we're going to have one-month and three-month treasuries sit at four basis points for the rest of the quarter, rest of the year, or were they going to bounce back? And they've clearly sat here or been weighted down. So I think that cost us about $5 in first quarter and relative to where we would have been cost us effectively another $5 in 2Q, which means kind of $10 cumulatively in 2Q, $10 in 3Q, $10 in 4Q, so that's not a -- I think that's not a welcome development. Now if they bounce back, we'll have some upside, but that's real, and then the other one that we're, I think, all just careful about is the attenuation of the MBS premium amortization. And I think you've seen a number of commentators talk about that around the industry. The last print that we all saw from the -- from Fannie, Freddie, had a small acceleration of prepayment rates instead of a downtick. And I think then by folks. But it's hopefully the last gas on prepayment as rates have boomed up, and now we're in burnout mode. But I think that slight one month that I'm fairly confident will be one month, it will be a -- and it's industry-wide, it's in the Fannie, Freddie data. I think it's just a reminder that we don't -- aren't sure of the pace of the attenuation of the premium amortization in these MBS books that we all run. We just have to be careful. Obviously, if the burnout goes faster and premium amortization falls more quickly, let me tell you, I'll be the first to signal that because I, like you and many others, are looking for not only the stabilization and we're confident in the stabilization now. But I'd love to see better than stabilization, we're just not quite at that point yet. Gerard, it's Eric. I think that's the $64,000 question that many banks are wrestling with, especially as some of the rule changes happen for others on SLR and as we think about leverage ratios. And clearly, we're in a new world. We had seen post the global financial crisis, the expansion of Fed balance sheet and then its recompression and now we're in a new era again. I think our general view is that the pots of the banking system will roughly track the Fed monetary policy expansion, so it will do so in waves. And I think we saw that in first and second quarter of last year, we saw quite an expansion. And then we saw some flatness in deposit balances. And then as the Fed buying, offset by some of the compression in the treasury's own portfolio, we saw some further uptick. And we've seen that again this year. I think we do expect continued expansion because we expect continued expansion of the Fed balance sheet, we do expect that to come back to banks. And I think from our standpoint, what we're trying to do is be open for business for our clients, and we'd like to do that every day of the week because that's important to them. And we've got some capacity to accommodate some of this growth as it comes. It's not infinite that every day of the week because the Fed balance sheet goes up another 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, we have to see when they're going to -- when they are going to start to constrain their own bond-buying activities slows down, pause, et cetera, we will, at the right time, to have to just work on some of our discretionary pools of deposits. We have those, and we have some capacity to adjust. We've got a suite of options for clients. We -- our deposit rates are at zero or near zero. So for clients, we can certainly facilitate other activities at the right point. That's not for today or tomorrow or next quarter necessarily. It's -- but it's in a year or two that comes, right? We can help them sweep to money market funds. We can help them sweep to -- with treasury securities. We can help them sweep into the repo business. And so we'll have to just navigate through. We feel pretty comfortable where we are today and in the next quarter or 2. But we'll just have to see if there's a wave, we'll address, and I think we'll just have to navigate through. Gerard, there is some good disclosure in some of the post quarter-end LCR type information that we and all the banks share. And we can -- I think all the banks share. And we can -- It gives different types of deposits, and it gives different kind of those different liquidity values, which starts to get at some of what you're describing around operational versus nonoperational, so we can follow up with you. Yes. We're always getting a little bit of volatility. I think one of the -- well, one of the things that we have is just overdrafts are coming through as a loan, right, as part of the book, so that's one. And I mentioned how that, that had a spike up at the end of the quarter. The other one is there's a good part of our loan book is the private equity firm capital call financing that we do. And that's had a nice bit of a seasonal effect and then late in the quarter, we've -- as we've seen these funds start putting more and more capital work, we'd start to have draws on those loans, and those have started to up the -- those draws have added to the balances in a nice way, and that's one of the reasons that we have -- we see some good continued growth in lending for us. Mike, it's Eric. On NII, I think the second quarter is the bottom, and that's why I've said likely to be at $460 million to $465 million per quarter for the rest of the year. So I think we've -- we're at the stabilization level, plus or minus a few bucks in that, in and around that range. And given what we know today, so we think that we're there, we're confident we're there. And now the question is how long is it flattish at that level? And then when does it pick up in that? I think we'll know more in the coming quarters. And on the fee waivers, what we've done is forecasted what they'd be for second quarter, the net 40-ish or so offset by balances versus the net 15-or-so from first quarter. But that's predicated on short rates being where they are today, and they've been kind of flattish the last 30, 45 days, and -- but that's the assumption. We're obviously hoping short rates stay flat or actually move up, that's supposed to go the other way. And so it's just based on that. There really, Vivek, it's Eric. There really two -- probably, two or three triggers or break points for us. I think one is the outright level of rates in -- we've seen some good movement in 10, we've not seen that much movement in 5s. And so the question is a little bit, when does the curve more broadly move because we -- while we'd like to put more money to work, we need to be a little careful of our duration because with duration comes AOCI volatility. And so it's and so it's curve that would be good to see. And right now, 5s are in the, whatever, 85, 90 basis point range, it'd be nice to see them a good bit higher. And 10s, for 10s to pay off, either in clean duration treasuries or an MBS, we need higher rates, a good bit higher before where we're on to make that trade at the right levels of higher rates, you get the benefit if rates were to come down off a positive AOCI, so that's helpful. But we're not at that level where we -- everything great is going to come back down very quickly. And so we actually need more of an upswing before we really lean into the trade. It doesn't mean we won't trade around the edges and trade the slope and so forth, but that's probably a little bit of framing that might help. Yes. Vivek, this was a legacy matter that dates a number of years ago. There were some costs that we, at this time, thought were reimbursable that were by either clients or other partners that we had. They did accumulate on the balance sheet, and we came to the conclusion recently that they're not reimbursable. And so effectively, they need to be expensed, and so we cleaned up the books here. But it dates back a number of years, and we made the adjustment accordingly. And then I don't know if Ken is still on, operator, but just to clarify, I misspoke a little bit on his RWA question. RWA was up, as I said, for -- in an episodic way about $5 billion or $6 billion this quarter. Had it not been up, our $10.8 million CET1 ratio would have been in the 11.2% to 11.3% range. That was inclusive. So it's all in guidance. It covers all the ins and outs of the business, including the update on money market fees. I think I've split the difference on that. It's -- the market's moved so much, we're trying to give some directional guidance. I think the -- for equity markets, we're still assuming the point-to-point increase in the period last year and the period this year of 10 percentage points. We'll see if that stays or not, given where we are, and we wrote this over the last week. So, we're also assuming equity markets stay around where they are now, which would line up with that endpoint as well."

O’Hanley: Thank you Ilene and good morning everyone. 2022 was an unpredictable year for many of the world’s investors and the people they serve. Despite a market rebound in the fourth quarter, 2022 was the worst year for financial markets since the global financial crisis. Both fixed income and equity markets impacted by the war in Ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds including bulk of supply chains, price and wage inflations, dramatically higher global interest rates, U.S. dollar strength, and heightened fears of global economic recession which remain today. The uncertainty created by these factors contributed to a meaningful year-over-year decline in global financial markets as well as increased market volatility impacting flows. Despite these difficult macro conditions, State Street performed well. As a result, we continued to progress in 2022 towards achieving our medium term targets. Our durable 4Q and full year 2022 results were driven by a strategy underpinned by our relentless focus on innovation, the power of our distinct value proposition, and State Street’s diversified products and services, all of which continue to resonate with clients as demonstrated by yet another year of strong, organic net new servicing wins.  As we continue to execute against our strategic agenda, we achieved a great deal in 2022. Slide 3 of our investor presentation shows our full year highlights and the progress we made towards achieving our strategic goals in 2022. In a challenging operating environment and compared to what was a very strong year for our business in 2021, we again delivered positive total operating leverage, pretax margin expansion, and a higher return on equity as you can see on the left of the slide. We drove continued business momentum, including 1.9 trillion of total new asset servicing wins, delivered total revenue growth, and demonstrated ongoing expense discipline in the face of inflationary pressures and our continued investment in the resiliency and capabilities of our businesses, as you can see on the right and bottom of the slide. While weaker average market levels created fee revenue headwinds for our investment servicing and asset management businesses in 2022, our balance sheet businesses combined with higher interest rates and our deposit strategy produced materially higher net interest income as compared to 2021. In addition, our foreign exchange trading services and front office software and data businesses produced double-digit year-over-year fee growth, manifesting the desired results of our investments in these businesses and demonstrating the revenue diversification of our business model. Turning to Slide 4 of our presentation, I will review our fourth quarter highlights. Business momentum was solid in the fourth quarter with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to 434 billion driven by broad based wins across client segments. We reported two new alpha mandates in the quarter and expanded 12 existing alpha relationships, seven of which added additional back and middle office offerings. Helped by this sales performance our AUC/A installation backlog was 3.6 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors quarter end assets under management totaled 3.5 trillion, supported by another good quarter of ETF inflows. Turning to our fourth quarter financial performance, 4Q 2022 EPS was 1.91 or 2.07 excluding notable items, up 7% year-over-year or 4% higher year-over-year excluding notable items. The year-over-year EPS growth in a challenging market environment was supported by the resumption of common share repurchases in the fourth quarter as we focused on returning capital to our shareholders. Even in a year marked by economic and political disruptions, total revenue for the fourth quarter was the highest on record, increasing 3% year-over-year as lower total fee revenue was offset by very strong NII result which increased 63% relative to the year ago, primarily driven by higher global interest rates plus our balance sheet positioning and effective execution of our deposit management strategy. As we meaningfully invested in our people and business, we remain focused on expense discipline in the fourth quarter with total expenses down 3% year-over-year or flat year-over-year, excluding notable items, in part supported by the stronger U.S. dollar. This was achieved by our relentless and ongoing focus on operational productivity, simplification and automation. Turning to our balance sheet and capital, our CET1 capital ratio increased to a strong 13.6% at year end. Recognizing the importance of capital return to our shareholders and having already announced a 10% per share increase to our common stock dividend earlier in 2022, we resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter, buying back a total of 1.5 billion of State Street's common stock. For 2023, it is our intention to return up to 200% of earnings in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. We expect our business mix, balance sheet strategy, and earnings momentum will enable us to do so while maintaining prudent capital ratios within our target range. Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock purchase program of up to 4.5 billion through the end of 2023.  To conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased to be reporting the third year in a row of pretax margin expansion and higher return on equity, which demonstrates the successful progress we have made towards achieving our financial goals. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail before I discuss our strategic priorities for 2023.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognized in the quarter outlined on Slide 5. First, we recognize acquisition and restructuring costs, including wind down expenses related to the Brown Brothers Investor Services acquisition transaction, which we are no longer pursuing. Second, we recognize 70 million of repositioning costs consisting of an employee severance charge of 50 million to eliminate approximately 200 middle and senior manager positions, largely related to our investment services business as we continue to streamline our organizational structure. We also recognized 20 million of occupancy charge in the quarter to help us further shrink our occupancy costs. We expect these actions to generate a total run rate savings of roughly $100 million. Lastly, we recognize the benefit of 23 million in the quarter related to the settlement proceeds from a 2018 FX benchmark litigation resolution, which is reflected in the FX trading services GAAP revenue line. Taken together, we recognize notable items of $78 million pretax, or $0.16 a share.  Now, turning to Slide 6, I'll begin my review of both our fourth quarter 2022 and full year 2022 results. As you can see on the top left of the table, despite the dynamic and challenging operating environment, the diversity and durability of our business model allowed us to finish the fourth quarter with solid results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 3% year-over-year or 5% year-over-year, excluding notable items, as lower fee revenue was more than offset by robust NII growth of 63%, which I'll spend more time discussing later in today's presentation. We also continued to demonstrate prudent expense management, which enabled us to deliver positive operating leverage in the quarter and pretax margin is up more than four percentage points year-on-year, while ROE is up more than a percentage point this quarter as well. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2022 performance. Notwithstanding the challenging operating environment, we saw in 2022 for the year, I am quite pleased that we again delivered positive operating leverage and nearly a percentage point improvement in pretax margin. As Ron mentioned, it has been three consecutive years of margin expansion and ROE improvement.  Turning to Slide 7, during the quarter we saw period end AUC/A decrease by 16% on a year-on-year basis, but increased 3% sequentially. Year-on-year the decrease in AUC/A was largely driven by continued lower period end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition, and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased as a result of higher quarter end equity market levels and the positive impact of currency translation.  At Global Advisors, we saw similar dynamics play out. Period end AUM decreased 16% year-on-year and increased 7% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels, some institutional net outflows, and the negative impact of currency translation, which was partially offset by 22 billion of net inflows in our SPDR ETF business. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was primarily due to higher quarter end market levels, ETF net inflows, and the positive impact of currency translation, partially offset by cash net outflows.  Turning to Slide 8, on the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average market levels, lower client activity adjustments and flows, normal pricing headwinds, and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of the currency translation, servicing fees were down 10% year-on-year. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 1%, primarily as a result of the client activity adjustments and flows.  On the bottom panel of this page, we've included some sales performance indicators which highlights the good business momentum we again saw in the quarter. As you can see, AUC/A wins in the fourth quarter totaled a solid 434 billion driven by strong broad based traditional wins across client segments and regions, including expanding relationships with existing alpha clients. At quarter-end AUC/A won but yet to be installed totaled $3.6 trillion, with alpha representing a healthy portion, which again reflects the unique value proposition of our strategy.  Turning to Slide 9, fourth quarter management fees were 457 million down 14% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average market levels and the negative impact of currency translation, which represented about two percentage point headwind. Quarter-on-quarter management fees were down 3%, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, notwithstanding the difficult and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop in the year, our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our continued strong business momentum. In ETFs we saw solid full year net inflows in the U.S. with continued momentum and market share gains in the SPDR low cost equity and fixed income segments.  In our institutional business, there's a continued momentum and defined contribution with 48 billion of inflows in the full year, including target date franchise net inflows of 21 billion, offset by industry wide outflows in Institutional Index products. In our cash franchise, we still gained 60 basis points of market share in money market funds in 2022, even though first half inflows reversed in fourth quarter.  On Slide 10, you see the strength of our diverse revenue growth engines with both FX trading services and software and processing up double-digit teens year-on-year in a difficult year. Relative to the period a year ago, fourth quarter FX trading services revenue ex-notables was up 15%, primarily reflecting higher FX spreads partially offset by lower FX volumes. Our global FX franchise was able to effectively monetize the less liquid market environment which was driven by sharp moves in the U.S. dollar. Sequentially FX trading services revenue ex-notables was up 8%, mainly due to higher direct and indirect revenue. Securities finance performance in the fourth quarter was more muted with revenues up 1% year-on-year. Sequentially revenues were down 6%, mainly reflecting downward pressure on spreads due to lower special activity and year-end risk of activity by clients.  Fourth quarter software and processing fees were up 16% year-on-year and 17% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenues associated with CRD, which were up 28% year-on-year and 25% sequentially. Lending fees for the quarter were down 10% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix and flat quarter-on-quarter. Finally, other fee revenue of 18 million in the fourth quarter was flattish year-on-year and up 23 million quarter-on-quarter, largely due to the absence of negative market related adjustments.  Moving to Slide 11, on the left panel you'll see fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased 28% year-on-year, primarily driven by multiple on-premise renewals and continued growth in software enabled revenue associated with new client implementations and client conversions to our cloud based SaaS platform environment.  Turning to some of the front office and Alpha business metrics on the right panel, the 21 million of new bookings in the quarter was once again well diversified across client segments, including asset owners, wealth and private markets as well as across asset classes, particularly in fixed income. Front office revenue, backlog and pipeline remains healthy, giving us confidence in the future growth of this business. As for Alpha, we are pleased to report to two new Alpha mandate wins this quarter in the insurance and asset owner of client segments.  Now turning to Slide 12, fourth quarter NII increased 63% year-on-year and 20% sequentially to 791 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short and long term market interest rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower deposits. We have a well-constructed balance sheet including both U.S. and foreign client deposits, a scale of sponsored repo franchise, and high quality loan and investment portfolio that was consciously configured to benefit from rising global rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by higher global market rates working through our balance sheet. On the right of this slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Year-on-year average assets declined 6% and increased 3% sequentially, primarily due to deposit levels as well as currency translation impacts. The U.S. client’s deposit beta, excluding some new deposit initiatives was about 65% to 70% during the fourth quarter. Foreign deposit betas for the quarter were much lower in the 20% to 50% range depending on currency. Our international footprint continues to be an advantage. Total average deposits were up sequentially. We saw sequential quarter reduction in non-interest bearing deposits of 5% which was more than offset by higher NII accretive interest bearing deposits that will help support high quality client loan growth and selective expansion of the investment portfolio. Turning the Slide 13, fourth quarter expenses excluding notable items were once again proactively managed in light of a tough fee revenue environment and flat year-on-year or up approximately 3% adjusted for currency translation. We have been carefully executing on our continued productivity and optimization savings efforts which generated approximately 90 million in year-on-year growth savings for the quarter or approximately 320 million for 2022, achieving near the top end of our full year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4%. These savings enabled us to drive positive operating leverage and pretax margin expansion, which while partially offsetting continued wage inflation headwinds and continued investments in strategic parts of the company, including alpha, private markets, technology, and operations automation. On a line by line basis compared to 4Q 2021 compensation employee benefits were down 1% as the impact of currency translation and lower incentive compensation was partially offset by higher salary increases associated with nearly 6% wage inflation and higher headcount. Headcount increased 9%, primarily in our global hubs as we added operations personnel to support growth areas such as alpha and private markets, invested in technology talent, and in sourced certain functions. There was also a portion of the headcount increase associated with some hiring catch up post COVID. We expect headcount to increase more modestly in 2023. Information systems and communications expenses were down 5% due to benefits from our insourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was up 1%, mainly reflecting higher broker fees and market data costs, partially offset by lower sub custody costs related to lower equity market levels. Occupancy was down 17% largely due to an episodic lease back real estate transaction associated with the sale of our data centers which was worth approximately 12 million. And other expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher professional fees and travel costs. Moving to Slide 14, on the left side of the slide we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels relative to our requirements. At quarter end, standardized CET1 ratio of 13.6% increased 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by episodically lower RWA, partially offset by the resumption of share repurchases in the quarter. With respect to RWA's, it's worth noting that we saw unusually low RWA this quarter worth about $10 billion, largely driven by our markets, businesses and some specific currency factors. We would anticipate a similar amount of normalization of RWA in the 10th $15 billion range going into first quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6% at quarter end, was down 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the resumption of share repurchases in fourth quarter.  We were quite pleased to return $1.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter, consisting of a 1.5 billion of common share repurchases and 220 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as Ron mentioned earlier, we announced this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock repurchase program of up to 4.5 billion through the end of 2023. And as I said in December, we expect to execute this buyback at pace and get back to our target ranges for both CET1 and Tier 1 leverage market conditions and other factors dependent. Turning the Slide 15, let me cover our full year 2023 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have significant potential for variability given the macro environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect some point to point growth in global equity markets in 2023, which equates to global equity markets being down about 2 percentage points year-on-year on a full year average basis. Our rate outlook for 2023 largely aligned with the forward curve, which I would note is moving continuously. However, we currently expect to reach peak rates of 5% per Fed funds, 3.25 at the ECB, and 4.5 at the Bank of England.  As for currency translation, we expect the U.S. dollar to be modestly stronger than the major currencies on average, but less than what we saw last year. As such, currency translations like to have 0.5 point or less impact on both revenues and expenses. In light of the macro factors I just laid out, we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be flat to up 1% ex-notable items with servicing fees likely flattish and management fees down a bit, largely due to a modest reclassification of revenue, other fees, and NII. Regarding the first quarter of 2023, we currently expect fee revenue to be down 1% to 2% ex-notable items on a sequential quarter basis, given some normalization of foreign exchange market volatility that impacts our trading business with servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and management fees expect to be down 1% to 2%. We expect full year 2023 NII to be up about 20% on a year-over-year basis after a very strong 2022. This is dependent of course on the outcome of rate hikes and deposit mix and levels. After a significant step up in fourth quarter 2022 NII, we expect first quarter 2023 to be flattish. And after the first quarter of 2023, we expect to see a slide 1% to 2% of sequentially quarterly attenuation of NII throughout the remainder of 2023, then with the stabilization expected in 2024. Turning to expenses, as you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex-notables will be up 3.5% to 4% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven partially by wage and inflationary pressures and continued investment in the business and our people, while still driving positive operating leverage. You can also see on the walk that for a full year 2023, we expect growth saves of approximately 3%, which will help offset inflationary pressures and variable costs and ongoing investments in areas like private markets and alpha and further automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2023, on a year-over-year basis, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be up about 2%. Finally, taxes should be in the 19% to 20% range for 2023. This outlook would deliver a fourth consecutive year of margin expansion and advances us towards our medium term target goal of 30%, as well as deliver positive operating leverage and strong EPS growth for our shareholders. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Thanks, Eric. As we enter 2023, we see an uncertain environment. On the positive side, many supply chains have been repaired, the outlook for energy supply is better than anticipated, particularly in Europe, and developed world inflation may have peaked. We proceed continued rising interest rates in the short term, but at a slower pace. The most significant known risks are geopolitical, including the Russia Ukraine War, China from an economic performance and policy perspective, and the United States as it approaches its debt ceiling. Turning to Slide 17, even with another year of economic and geopolitical uncertainty ahead of us, we continue to be very clear in our strategic priorities for 2023 focusing on what we can control. We plan to deliver further growth, drive innovation, and continue to enhance shareholder value as we further progress State Street towards its medium term targets. First, we are targeting further improvements in our business growth and profitability by leveraging State Street’s alpha value proposition and enhancing its private markets capabilities. As we aim to become the leading investment service or platform and enterprise outsource solutions provider in the industry, we intend to maintain and extend our leadership positions in a number of key businesses. In global markets, we aim to expand wallet share as a leading provider of liquidity, financing, and research solutions to investment professionals. At Global Advisors, we aim to build on our strengths in areas such as ETFs and cash, while organically accelerating growth efforts in fast growing segments where we can win.  Second, as we have over the past several years, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization as we build out a simplified, scalable, configurable end-to-end operating model. As we lead with client service excellence, productivity will become a core differentiator of our value proposition. Third, we must continue to build a higher performing organization. We are strengthening execution skills and increasing accountability, thereby fostering an even more results oriented culture required for future growth. Our fourth priority is supported by and the intended outcome of the first three priorities and is aimed at achieving our financial goals, meaning another year of positive operating leverage, margin expansion, and higher returns.  To conclude, supported by our distinctive value proposition and diversified offerings, as well as our ability to manage State Street through challenging environments, I believe that we will be able to execute on each of these strategic priorities in 2023 as we advance towards achieving our financial goals, all while being an essential partner to the world's investors and the people they serve. And with that operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you very much. I like the NII outlook, I want to ask you a question on that. You've been a big beneficiary of higher rates. I'm curious on the deposit side, down almost 10% year-on-year in the quarter, but actually up a drop sequentially. I wanted to think about or could you tell us what you're thinking about that you have stable outlook for 2023 for deposits, we've seen a lot of fear in the banks in deposit runoff and betas and attrition and so curious what gives you that confidence for the flat deposits for the year, thanks?\nEric Aboaf: Glenn, it's Eric. We've navigated through interest rate cycles before, right, and so we have a fair amount of internal data. And we also have, I think, an engagement with our clients that really understands the multiple avenues for them of putting their cash. Clients broadly with us have $1 trillion of cash, some of that's in deposits, some of that's in our sponsor repo program. Some of that's in our global advisers, money market complex, some of it's in our suite products in our State Street Global Link franchise. And so what we're seeing is that clients are shifting gently their deposits between different categories. But they also need an outlet for that cash. They need an outlook for that cash at a reasonable price, at a reasonable ability to move it and use it as necessary. So with that as a context, I think we continue to see some expected rotation out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, that's been happening, I think, at a reasonable pace and kind of in line more or less with what we've seen before, and we expect that to continue for the next few quarters. At the same time, clients do have cash, especially given the risk-off environment but in general, they all sit on cash as part of their investment planning. And we found that they're engaged with us to leave cash in our balance sheet. They like the flexibility. They like some of the pricing. And obviously, some cash comes in at noninterest-bearing, some at lower rates when it's very transactional, some at rates that are closer to market levels. And so it's an ongoing engagement with them and the visibility we have is reasonably good. It can always change. But deposits as a result, seem to be in the zone now after couple of quarters in the first half of the year of coming down a bit, seem to be flattening out. I won't say that we won't see a little bit of seasonality occasionally in January until February, we see a downtick. And then March folks prepare for tax payments is up and then April is down. So we'll see some of that kind of movement. But on average, we expect deposits to be flattish from -- going forward into next year and through the bulk of the year.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that color. That's good. You mentioned repo, so maybe I'll just have my follow-up question. In the slides, I noticed you created this inventory platform for peer-to-peer repo, I would love a minute to go on what it is for, who is it for, and how you get -- how that -- you will get paid for that? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Sure. This is part of the, I think, innovation heritage that we have here at State Street across the franchise, but inclusive of the global markets area. We -- our sponsored repo program, which is now $100 billion in size, was started in I'm sorry, in 2005, I think, if I go back to the history books. And there's now a $100 billion franchise, right, as an example. And we do this in FX, we do this in sec lending. Venturi is a repo offering that instead of working through our balance sheet or one of the clearing corporations, which is how we do repo today actually directly connects lenders and borrowers of securities and cash. And so it's just another platform, so to speak, another venue that clients seem to want to engage with. A big part of it early on is working with the asset owners, those who are -- have long booked securities and cash. And what we find is sometimes when they may want to make margin calls for -- or have margin calls, they want to raise cash without selling securities, right. And so a natural question of well, where do I repo, do I repo through a bank structure, or do I repo with someone who's on the other side of that trade, right, who actually wants to lend against securities. And so we find that there are counterparties on the other side of that trade, who would be interested in doing that. And what a Venturi does is it actually connects borrowers and lenders with direct access to one another. So they have both the underlying collateral as the stabilizing force. And then they have the counterparty rating. And with different counterparties, you get slightly different pricing and sometimes that flow-through is actually positive and quite appealing both to the lenders and borrowers. So that's a little bit of it in a nutshell. We like to grow it to some amount during the course of the year, early returns are positive. But it's -- I'll put it in a bucket of innovation and how to connect folks in the capital markets, but connect folks who our core clients and provide additional services for them.\nGlenn Schorr: Great tutorial, thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning. \nRonald P. O’Hanley: Hi, Betsy. \nBetsy Graseck: Okay, one follow-up question on NII and then a question on expenses. Just a follow-up question on NII Eric, I just wanted to make sure I understood the cadence, the pace that you are suggesting NII should follow. I know you used the word attenuate, but we had a debate over here as to which way attenuate was going to traject, so sorry to ask the ticky-tacky, but appreciate it?\nEric Aboaf: That's all right. But we want to be transparent and sometimes language always matters, as you say. Our perspective is we've got a very nice step-off point from fourth quarter NII. We said we'd be roughly flattish into the first quarter. And then we expect it to trend downwards, so attenuate downward, let's say, 1% to 2% for the next few quarters. Just as you see you see a tailwind of interest rates creating a positive but you see that continued rotation out of net interest bearing deposits being a headwind. And the net of that is down NII we think 1% to 2% for a couple of quarters. And then towards the end of the year and into 2024, we see rough stabilization probably because we've kind of burned out on the noninterest-bearing rotation, and then we get to a more stabilized area. But all in, we expect full year NII to be up about 20% year-over-year, and we'll take it from there.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Yes. No, that's helpful. And then on the expense side, I know you mentioned that the benefit of the actions you've taken, am I right, $100 million run rate. I just wanted to understand when that comes into the 2023, is that immediate in 1Q, or is that something that comes in over time, just that would be helpful? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Roughly about half of that comes in, in 2023. The payback on most of these actions is about five quarters so roughly half comes in on a fiscal 2023 basis. And then we'll hit the run rate, I think, within quarters, whatever, sixish or something after these actions, most of these actions are in the next few let's call it the next quarter. The run rate then builds to $100 million. So good payback and the kind of actions we want to keep taking in this kind of environment.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. So your point, that was my final follow-up, which was, do you feel this is the extent or if for whatever reason, top line disappoints based on macro not working out or what have you, is there more that you would consider doing going forward?\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Betsy, it's Ron. Maybe I'll take that. I mean, we've obviously got a pattern of investments that we're intending to execute. We've also got an ongoing program in place that we've really had running now since 2019. So we certainly -- if the environment were to change materially, we would think about those investments. We would also think about being more aggressive. I mean, we have more or less in the background, continued to take a lot of gross expense out of the system every year. We see an ongoing ability to do that, but we also want to keep investing in the business. So there is a balance there. But to the extent to which things started to go south in an unanticipated way, I mean we do have levers.\nBetsy Graseck: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nKenneth Usdin: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if we -- if you had any kind of just -- well, post-game thoughts -- post the BBH decision and within that, just you acknowledged and put forth this $4.5 billion capital plan. Just how will we think about just your commitment to that now as opposed to whatever thoughts you might have about acquisitions going forward? Thank you. \nRonald P. O’Hanley: Ken, I mean, as we've always said, we've got a very clear strategy and M&A is not a strategy. M&A is a way to help execute a strategy, to move it faster, to enable it to get further than was anticipated. But it's not a strategy by itself. We are very comfortable with our organic strategy. BBH was a scale enhancing acquisition that we would have liked to have done, but it doesn't materially change. In fact, it doesn't change at all our strategy. So at this point, where we sit, we have a strategy that we like. We have a strategy that we're executing against. There are some big milestones that we're confident we're going to be delivering on in 2023. And therefore, we are committed to that share buyback.\nKenneth Usdin: Okay, great. And then on servicing fees, can you help us understand in your flat to plus one, what's the impact of the BlackRock ETF deconversion, where are we in that process, and how much, if any, has already been recognized of that expected revenue attrition at this point? Thank you. \nEric Aboaf: Yes, I think maybe just to answer that in the various components. I think you saw the BlackRock transition begin at the end of last year was $10 million in the quarter, sort of call it, a $40 million run rate. That continues to transition out in 2023 and in 2024, there's obviously just a natural schedule that you expect that we've worked closely with them on. And so it'll impact our servicing fees during 2023, during 2024, and into 2025, just when you think about the year-on-year comparison basis. I think if you want to model it out broadly, we've said in our last regulatory filing, we said it was worth about two percentage of fees as of the December 31 pointer we just crossed. It's now about 1.7% of fees. And I'll let you sort of build it from there. But it's included in our forecast. It will continue to be included in our forecast. We think about net new business, right, we've got to sell. We always have a bit of attrition, and we'll -- we want to continue to be net ahead. And as you've seen us in the last couple of years, we've been net positive with net organic growth broadly. And then with BlackRock, specifically, they continue to be a very important client of ours. We have continued and kept a good amount of business that we do with them. We're strong providers for them in alternatives, which is growing quickly. And we've also been awarded new business over the last year. And so that will just -- I think it will just be part of the outlook that I give you as we go forward.\nKenneth Usdin: Okay, great, thanks a lot. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nAlexander Blostein: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe just to follow-up on Ken's last point around servicing fees. I guess if you take your run rate servicing fees at the end of the year, it still implies a pretty wide gap versus where you guys expect to end for 2023. So maybe just provide a little bit more granularity where the ramp is going to come from. So I know equity market is one thing, and you guys are assuming, I think, 10-ish-percent growth in global equity, so that certainly helps. But off of the kind of $4.8-ish billion run rate that you exited that to get to, I don't know, $5.1 billion, that's a 6% growth that's still wider than we've seen in the past. So I'm just curious whether it's new business or something else that you see on the horizon that will help you bridge that gap?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Alex, if you -- I think I tend to spend a little more time on the full year to full year kind of servicing fees, it sounds like you're modeling the last four quarters and then the next four quarters, which obviously model as well, and we have in our budget. It's really a combination of factors, right. So there is -- on a -- if you start with fourth quarter of 2022 and then work forward, we expect some appreciation in equity markets. We'll see if that plays out, and we'll obviously stay in touch with you all. We think that will be a tailwind. We think client flows and activity, in particular, should not be a headwind like it was in 2022, maybe neutral, maybe a positive just as clients have adapted to this new environment. And so we see the new year -- this new year as a time when they're going to be trading, investing, building positions. So we'll see if that plays out, that will be part of it. Then we have net new business. And so we do have a good pipeline both in the traditional servicing and Alpha area. And I think as part of that, we continue to mine our existing client base because the share of wallet growth can be positive there. And then finally, there's always some amount of normal pricing headwinds, but that's factored in. But you kind of have to go through those four areas. And remember, we're assuming some growth in equity markets on a point-to-point basis but we'll see if that plays out.\nAlexander Blostein: I got you. Alright, that's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up around the balance sheet strategy. I heard the NII guidance, the deposit commentary all makes sense. When it comes to the tailwinds from sort of repricing the fixed portfolio, the fixed securities portfolio, can you help us frame what the roll-on, roll-off dynamic looks like today? And also whether or not there are some more opportunistic actions you guys might take liqutine [ph] with both RFBK [ph] and Northern over the last month or so. With respect to just maybe reaccelerate some of the lower-yielding securities roll off into something that might be a little more attractive here.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Let me describe it as follows. The investment portfolio has an average duration of a bit over two and half years, so call it average maturity of five years. And so you go through the math, and that means about 20% of it rolls on, rolls off in a typical year. It will move around a bit. I think what we found, and that's invested across the curve, it's invested in various currencies, so there's a mix. So you tend to get as you have rolled-off, rolled-on somewhere between 1%, 1.5% to sometimes 2.5% tailwind for that particular quarter of the amounts that are rolling off and rolling on. And so that's what's actually been one of the factors that's in billing the yields and the yield improvement on the profile and both how it was designed and what we're pleased to see. So that will be a gentle tailwind assuming five-year rates stay more or less where they are and European rates continue to float up. And so we'll just have to -- that will be one of the tailwinds that we see.  In terms of more dramatic action, we obviously always think about what we might do. What we've noticed is that if you have high risk-weighted asset positions in your risk-weighted asset-intensive positions in your portfolio, then what happens, you could take the loss, you reinvest, and it helps accelerate a buyback, right. That's why I think a number of players are doing that. Doing the -- just the -- for vanilla instruments, treasuries, agencies, government-guaranteed securities, there's -- I think the benefits are a little closer to a push. We could take some losses through the P&L. They're already in the equity accounts through AOCI, you put on NII in the future. I think that's just moving around of the financials, and we just don't find that that's a particularly compelling trade to do. We'll always evaluate well. So we see if we have specific positions that might need some adjustment. But we don't see that as particularly compelling. It's not really compelling economically. And the financial benefits you guys can kind of model out either way. And so we -- I think we're pleased with the ability to continue to manage the portfolio in line with our current processes, and they've been numerous. The NII is up significantly this past year and up another 20% next year, and we've got a tailwind and it -- I think it bodes well for where we are and where we're going.\nAlexander Blostein: I got you. Great, thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks, good morning folks. Actually on net interest revenue outlook for 2023, Eric, can you talk a little bit about what you view as sensitivity to say if we had rate cuts in the back half of the year, I don't think that's assumed in your outlook, but just if you can talk about that dynamic and whether you think that would just be offset by reducing the deposit beta? And then also on the foreign deposit beta that you talked about, which is much better than U.S. Do you expect that to continue or do you see incremental foreign deposit betas moving higher from here?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, let me do it in reverse order. The U.S. versus foreign currency betas in our experience, this cycle, prior cycles, do tend to run at different levels, partly because the U.S. has the structure of noninterest-bearing versus interest-bearing deposits. So the client deposit betas are in a subset of the total and partly because the international markets just operate a bit differently, how we're paid and how that -- those expectations have been set over, I'll call it, decades for the industry, operate differently. So I think for the -- as we look into the next few quarters, we think the U.S. client deposit betas ex any new money that we bring in on an initiative basis is going to be in that 65% to 70% and the international betas, we think will continue in the 20% to 50% range when you look at Euros, Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollars, Aussie Dollars and some of the other currencies. So we think they're kind of in the -- they're going to be in this zone and that gives us some ability to continue to take advantage of the interest rate increases.  If I then work through the other part of your question, what happens with rate cuts, that's in our expectations, that's in the forward curves, especially for the U.S., that there could be a December cut. There's some probability there could be a cut before that. I think it doesn't dramatically affect because they are late in the year. The rate cuts don't dramatically affect the NII forecast, so we'll kind of take it as it goes. I do think you're -- as you're intimating, there's a bit of this offset, which is if the Fed's cutting rates, and there's probably going to be even more cash that clients keep on hand and deposits in the system, there'll probably be some offsetting impact. And obviously, with the U.S. betas higher, conveniently rate cuts actually at some point help with the NII as well. So I think there's a fair amount of -- there's a range of scenarios, let's call it, in the second half of next year. And so my guess is, Brian, we're going to be having this conversation often with you. And we'll certainly keep you posted as we see some of those scenarios develop or there's more variability.\nBrian Bedell: That's super helpful. And then just maybe on asset servicing, just maybe an update on how you're seeing the pricing headwinds fold out for this year and also obviously, you typically do get a pricing headwind just from a mix shift towards ETFs, but maybe if you could talk about whether you think that might be set offset by some of the growth in alternatives? And then I know I think there is an expense offset too or I should say, I believe the margin is the same on ETFs versus say, mutual funds, so you again an expense offset, so maybe if you just want to confirm that?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, Brian, I think the pricing experience that we're seeing in the industry has been stable and consistent over the last few years, and we expect it to be consistent into next year and beyond. We just have the standard because our contracts are tied to equity markets, when they roll over every four, five, six years, typically, folks are thinking whether they expect equity markets to be. They know we're going to get paid, they're going to pay us more in the coming years, and they want to share some of that. And so there's a partial pricing offset. But it's in the 2% headwind per year on servicing fees and been relatively consistent.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Yes. Brian, it's Ron. The mutual fund to ETF shift, the -- I mean there's been some high-profile conversions of mutual funds to ETFs. But that's -- there's not a lot of that going on. More typically, what you're seeing is ETFs being added to lines. And yes, the economics are different, the revenues fees are lower, but also particularly when you're at scale like us, the expenses are much lower. So it's not meaningful in this overall revenue kind of guide that we're giving you.\nBrian Bedell: Yeah, perfect, great. Thank you so much. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. \nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. So I'd like to start on capital. So the buyback sends a strong message. Ron, very encouraging to hear about your comments on M&A. But I wanted to clarify that the buyback is up to $4.5 billion. So does the upper end of the range there assume that you're going to see some AOCI accretion and is the quarterly range of $120 million to $200 million still the right way to think about it, if rates are stable?\nEric Aboaf: Brennan, it's Eric. The answer is yes and yes, right? If you think about it, we forecasted just you guys just as you have earnings and coming through the P&L, AOCI in that range, $120 million to $200 million a quarter, it bounces around a little bit and it may with movements in rates. But the pull apart has been good to us and will be a nice tailwind. There's some normalization of RWAs, which I mentioned into the first quarter, then there is some RWA growth in our plans because we want to continue to lend more to clients and support more with their foreign exchange or hedging activity so we'll continue to do that. And then there's the buyback. And our plan is just to at pace, get back into our range and that authorization comfortably gets us there.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay, excellent. And then a couple folks have touched on it before, but maybe if we think about the fee revenue, can you please update us on the impact of market moves to fee revenues and whether or not there also a corresponding impact on the expense side to I'd assume there's at least some degree of impact there? Thanks. \nEric Aboaf: Yes, let me do it this way. I think as we've -- we have been relatively consistent here and I think the guidance will hold a 10% average change in let's call it, an increase in equity markets, right, will typically lead to about a 3% increase in servicing fees, if you have both of those on average. So that's the kind of gearing we have. It's higher on management fees, 10% higher equity and markets tend to be closer to a 5% increase in management fees.  On the expense side, if I -- it moves around a bit, but I think it's a 10% average increase in equity markets. Probably close to let’s say around -- the range around a percentage point increase in expenses could be a little bit less, it kind of depends. But our subcustodian costs are -- have a gearing towards equity markets and fixed income markets, market data, in some cases, does as well.  So it could be half a point, could be a point, and that's part of the what we have in the expense walk and outlook that we have given and in some ways I think we are actually pleased to see that particular expense increase because that particular expense increase comes with a real revenue growth and that’s – and that delivers EBIT and earnings growth when you bring it all together. \nBrennan Hawken: Excellent, thank you for that color. \nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Search. Please go ahead. \nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. So Eric, I actually have a two part if you'll indulge me just on some of the NII guidance. First, I was hoping you could provide just some guardrails on your assumptions for NIB outflow given you're relatively close to the trough that we saw last cycle? And the -- for the second part, just since you alluded to NII stabilizing beyond 2023, even as NID remixing pressures abate and reinvestment tailwinds start to work through the balance sheet, was curious why NII isn't actually growing beyond 2023, is that a function of rate cuts, international mix, any perspective would be really helpful?\nEric Aboaf: Alright, well the -- crystal balling into 2024, I got to tell you, we've got a lot of variability playing out right now, whether it's economic, whether it's central banks. And I think I know there's a lot of talk about what's happening in NII, where do we go to, and then does it -- what happens after we get to a peak. So, I was just trying in 2024 to kind of level set that we see stability. There's a scenario where you see growth. There are scenarios where we may not. But it's hard, it's -- you're getting far out on our forecasting and predictions to be honest. So let's come back to that maybe in the middle of the year, that will be a good conversation.  In terms of noninterest bearing, you saw noninterest-bearing on average was about $44 billion this quarter. This quarter, meaning fourth quarter, it was down 5% sequentially. It's bounced around quarterly but we see -- I don't know, you could have off the $44 billion, you could have a $4 billion rotation out next quarter. You could see that again into the next quarter. Then it starts to -- or it could be $3 billion and then $2 billion and so on and so forth. So we're -- I think we're at this level where we've seen some amount of rotation. We think it's going to continue roughly at the pace that it's been going. So it could be anywhere between $2 billion, $3 billion and $4 billion a quarter, but you could have some changes to that. What we do think is that we'll continue to see some of it in the first half of the year, and then it just starts to slow down into the second half. And what we've done is to use that kind of base case into our modeling. And it's all factored into the 20% increase in NII that we expect for next year.\nSteven Chubak: That's great. And my defense, Eric, since you did talk about stabilization, I felt like I had to take advantage of that window of opportunity, to look forward to talking about it a little bit more in the middle of the year. Just one more for me on capital management, I was hoping you could just speak to or give us some insight into the cadence. Should we expect that buyback to be executed ratably or be a little bit more front-loaded here? And just given the commitment or at least early like a strong effort to optimize your capital levels, how are you scenario planning for the Basel IV proposal or update that we should be getting from the Fed early in 2023?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. All fair and it's a kind of discussion we have internally. We want to front-load the buyback. You saw us start particularly strong this past quarter. And we want some amount of front loading. On the other hand, it's actually quite stabilizing to the stock to have buybacks on a consistent basis. So, I think we're -- we don't want to front load at an extreme, and we don't want to be ratably flat through the year at the extreme either because it gives, I think, it's a good kind of market practice to have some I'll call it, front loading, but reasonable consistency in the buyback as well. I think then the goal is to get into our target range at pace. And then we'd love to operate in the middle of our range over time. That's kind of how a range is set up. But I think what we always have to do is look out on the horizon is are the economic conditions worsening, right? And so then you may be want to run close to the upper end of the range to insulate and prepare or are they particularly benign and they're particularly good uses of capital, and you might want to be at the lower end. Similarly, I think we'll learn more about Basel III and some of the changes in capital rules, maybe that comes with other changes in capital rules, we don't know. And I think later this year, we'll evaluate and that's another reason to either run towards in different areas of the range as well. So, it all factors in, but I think we're quite comfortable with the direction where we want to go and then like you will -- we'll think about what's on the horizon and plan for that.\nSteven Chubak: That’s great, thanks so much for taking my questions. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. \nGerard Cassidy: Good afternoon guys. Eric, as a follow-up on the stock repurchase commentary, did you guys -- and especially in the sense you referenced it would be more front-end loaded, did you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, we did. And I think what the accelerated share repurchase program typically does is operate in such a way that the stock buyback is accelerated within the course of the quarter, right, within the three-month period. There are typically some benefits of that. You tend to add $0.01 or around that EPS. It's actually interesting in a high interest rate environment, you also lose the NII benefit of the capital. So we've actually found that the ASRs tend to be a push roughly. And so we're -- we often do a more typical buyback within the available trading days in the quarter in a way that's fairly market practice as a way to return the cash and the capital to all of you.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then I know you pointed to the RWA benefit you had this quarter for the CET1 ratio. And I think you said in your slides, you're targeted range is 10% to 11%, which, of course, you're above at this time. Do you have any guidance on when you think you may reach your targeted 10% to 11% CET1 range?\nEric Aboaf: It will depend on -- let me say it this way, we want to return the capital at pace and I've given some bookends as to what that means. And that's, I think, a forecast you guys can build off of. And we want to get to our target range, we don't want to wait until, I don't know, next Christmas. That's not the -- that would not be at pace in my nomenclature. At the same time, there's just a range of what will move. If RWAs lighten again, it'll take a little longer. If they go back and we fully utilize our limits in our various businesses and areas, then it might be a little more quickly. So it's hard to pin it down, but as I said, we'd like to get to -- we'd like to execute the buyback at pace. We'd like to get back to a range -- into a range at pace and we're going to -- we're driving that direction.\nGerard Cassidy: Great, appreciate it, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. \nMichael Mayo: Hi, Well thanks for all the answers on the cyclical factors. I wanted to ask about the structural end game, a strategic end game post Brown Brothers. And the reason I ask, I count five restructurings in the last 20 years. They seem to come around like the softness the Olympics. The fourth quarter is yet one more quarter with notable items, account notable items in 18 of the last 20 quarters. And I do get some of it. Like you have incredible headwinds, mutual funds, markets, technical debt. You've been reinventing yourself front-to-back, straight reprocessing, serving clients, more agile tech. And I also recognize what you said at the start that the ROE and the margin improved for a couple of years in a row. But when I look at fee expenses, that has gone the other way and it seems like maybe one route issue is fixed cost. So really, the question is a concrete question, what percent of your expenses are fixed, how does that compare to the past, I'm assuming they've come down and where would you like to take that? And then more broadly, what is the end game strategy after Brown Brothers? Thanks.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Yes. Let me start on that, [indiscernible] there's a lot in there. A comment on -- I'm not going to comment on past restructurings, I'll comment on this one, right. We've made some changes to the way we organize ourselves. We talked about that back in the middle of the year. And there's some benefits we can take out of that in terms of simplifying the management structure, having a smaller number of senior managers, we're going to take advantage of that. It's consistent with simplifying our business. It creates accountability and we stand by the need have done that restructuring. In terms of where do we take this business going forward, it's -- it has a lot of benefits to it. It's very tied to investment markets over time. Investment markets grow, they don't shrink. So the actual, if you will, unit pricing while the unit pricing may go down, overall pricing actually -- overall revenue is actually more times than not have the tailwind. We like that business. It's also one that is changing fundamentally from being a kind of a back office, show me the lowest price kind of thing to much more of an enterprise outsourcing business. We are very new in that. We're very early in that transition. And we think by far, we are the best positioned to take advantage of that in terms of the technical capabilities that we have, the people capabilities that we have, the position we have in the marketplace. We've made initial in roads and wins in that, but there's development that we talked about that will be delivered in 2023 and beyond, but a lot of it in 2023 that will only help strengthen our position. So we see the end game here in terms of the core investment servicing business as being one which is much more akin to an outsourcing services business, much less susceptible to kind of these instantaneous, I'm going to put it to RFP. And it's just a stickier business. And we are very respectful and wary of our competitors because having an edge and a lead can be easily caught up on. But we -- right now, we believe we have that edge and lead, we're going to capitalize on it. In the investment management business, again, similar kinds of changes there. We're seeing an increased desire for the kinds of things that we do, systematic and otherwise. Asset allocation, which we are very, very good at is now an area that everybody is talking about after literally decades of reliance on the 60-40 model, and guess what, it didn't work or it doesn't work at all time. It will lead to a lot of thinking and demand for that. So we like our businesses. We like where we are strategically. In terms of what's going to happen, will there be other Brown Brothers out there. What I do think that you will see over time is an increasing number of competitors where this may not be their core business saying enough is enough. The capital requirements are -- in terms of the investment capital requirements are much too high, mostly above the technology. If it really does continue into an outsourcing kind of environment like we believe it will, it's going to put more demand to invest in the business. And if this is business 42 of your 80 business structure, you might decide you don't want to be in this business. So that's how we see it going forward.\nMichael Mayo: That was expansive, thank you. And the fixed cost part of the question, you don't report it that way, but just in rough terms, I guess. So in asset servicing, less RFPs, lowest price, this enterprise outsourcing, okay, investment management, more holistic instead of the real old model. But still as you transition, you have a certain degree of fixed costs that are tough to manage. I mean it's not quite like a brokerage firm where you reduced bonuses. So is there any way just to ballpark how much of your expenses are fixed costs and I think they've come down from the past, you're probably trying to floor them more?\nEric Aboaf: Mike, it's Eric. All good questions. I think that this section in the industry, which used to be variable cost intensive, right, it was very manual, and when you add a new piece of business, you actually have to hire fund accountants. We're working on ledger paper first and then on the Excel sheets next. And so it's quite manually intensive and variable in nature. It's actually as we've automated, think about the data centers, you've talked about the movement to the cloud, the developers that we have, this business has really evolved to a fixed and semi-fixed cost oriented business in truth. And that means that for certain types of business, we bring on custody business, core custody. Those are kind of the most automated and the most the oldest part of what sits in our franchise, that comes in, you plug it in, and the computers just process a few more times, not overnight, but literally in nanoseconds. And so this has become a more fixed cost business. And so what we need to do is think about how do we want to manage those fixed costs, how are they deployed, the development dollars and technology, how do we shape that each year because we can -- if we do that right, we'll add feature functionality and that will bring in new business over time, that will help retention and that will help growth.  And so this is more of a fixed cost business and semi-fixed costs. Where is it? It's more 80-20 fixed and semi-fixed than 20-80. And I think it actually has evolved. And so what's important for us to do is to make sure that we have the products and the offerings and the client coverage to support that and to add new business, add the right type of new business. And then where there are variable cost components, we've talked about some of the more manual and complex areas. Servicing for private, for example, is still quite manual, it's complicated. They are not standard systems. Typically, in the industry, there are no -- there's very little in third-party software that one could avail oneself of, those are the variable areas where we need to continue to find ways to automate and streamline and that's part of what we're doing with the ongoing investment program that we have underway.\nMichael Mayo: Alright, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. \nRobert Wildhack: Hi guys. AUC/A wins in the fourth quarter were pretty good. And Eric, you called out a strong pipeline there. What level of new business wins are you expecting in 2023? And do you see those coming from any specific client category, cohort, service area, anything like that?\nEric Aboaf: As we have said, the pipeline remains strong. I think we're pleased with wins this year. Wins were about $1.9 trillion for the full year. What I have said is and I think we feel good about this target or line in the sand as we've said, to drive the kind of organic growth that we'd like we want to win about $1.5 trillion per year of new business. We did that this past year, we did it in space closer to double that in 2021. And so -- and that's our expectation. We expect and we think that's par for 2023 as well. Obviously, we want to sell more than that. We want to bring in new -- more new clients or further deepen relationships with existing clients. I think what we feel good about here is both the new business this year, the $1.9 trillion that has come in has come in at good fee rates. The fee rates of the new wins are actually in line with our overall fee rate this year. And so that means that as it on-boards it will be neutral or even accretive to the fee rate. So that's important and that's an important part of the program. In terms of segments, it's been broad-based. I mean this past quarter, for example, was broad-based across regions, literally, I think it was a third, a third, a third and we saw particularly strong growth this past year in Asia. We'd like to repeat that again. I think we got -- we have an intensity on Europe and North America as well. So there's not -- I'd say it's not one particular segment or one particular region. It's fairly broad. But it's a good pipeline overall.\nRobert Wildhack: Got it. And then you also mentioned some higher renewals in the Alpha business. Wondering if you could talk about the retention rate there, how is the retention among front-to-back clients compared to your more traditional back or middle office only clients?\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Yes, Rob, I mean in terms of fully installed Alpha clients, the retention rate is 100%. And you wouldn't expect it to be much less than that simply because it's still relatively new. I think that there's a real commitment that's made on both sides of the house when you enter into these things. First of all, to actually rewire the firm around -- for the client to rewire around front to back. There's a lot of effort on their part. And while there's a lot of commonality across these clients, there's a lot on our part that we need to do to install it. So contracts are longer. But the reality is that the switching costs have also gone up dramatically in these front-to-back things. So we would expect more. But we also recognize that we've got to earn that. I mean we've got -- right now, there's a -- when that happens, there's a huge dependency on the part of the client and us delivering every day. And so we take that responsibility quite seriously.\nRobert Wildhack: Got it, thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. \nVivek Juneja: Thank you. Just a couple of little details for you, Eric. You mentioned RWA came down by about $10 billion and you expect to see another decline $10 billion to $15 billion. Any color on what you did there and does it sustainable post 1Q?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Let me just clarify. RWA was lower than expected in the fourth quarter by about $10 billion. And in first quarter, we expect it to reverse, in other words, to move back up by $10 billion, $12 billion, $15 billion. And it's just driven by some of the underlying volatility in our business. For example, overdrafts were lighter than expected this quarter. They moved around by a few billion dollars, and that moves RWA by a few billion dollars each quarter. In the FX book, we run a very sort of a typical forward book 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks forward. And as you have U.S. dollar appreciation or depreciation, you can get you can get $5 billion moves in RWA relatively easily. So that's just the volatility that we saw. We tend to be quite careful to stay within our RWA internal limits. That's why we tend not to have upswings in RWA, but we tend to have these beneficial quarters now and then. And we'll just note them to you so you can model out our capital ratio trends.\nVivek Juneja: Great. Second, another little detail for you, your software processing and data, could you parse that into data versus CRD since that's not combined. So you got this big growth rate there? What's going on underneath? How much is data? How much is...?\nEric Aboaf: Sure. It's a combination. I mean, the bulk of that is really around Charles River and the franchise that we purchased back in 2018, which has really given us the kind of growth that we had expected. So you can go back and compare the size of the franchise, I think at the last disclosure. I think we probably showed it a year ago and compare it to that software and data line and get a kind of an adjustment. But it's the large majority, I'll say, of that line. Data to us is though a very appealing offering that supplements what's in -- sometimes sold with the Charles River offering sometimes with Alpha and the middle office, sometimes sold as supplemental to just custody and accounting because it's such a high-value and informative kind of window, sometimes for risk management purposes, sometimes for client transparency purposes for our asset manager or asset owner clients. And so it's actually one of the faster growing areas of that area. And that's why we've put it together because it's actually a software type sale, but an important one.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Yes Vivek, it's Ron. Let me just add to that because we've done a lot of innovation in this area of new product development, and we do expect that to continue to grow as Eric said, because what -- everybody is interested in simplifying their operations, simplifying and getting control of their tech depth and innovating on the technology side. But in addition, there's a data management, data control in some parts of the world with some investors, it's also location of data. Where does the data actually both move and rest. So this is sitting increasingly -- this is a growth area. It goes beyond asset managers, large asset owners in particular very interested in this. So we see it as a way to extend what we're doing broadly in the Alpha arena.\nVivek Juneja: And just to clarify on CRD, Eric, to your comment earlier, when you previously talked about it was growing in sort of the low double-digit range. This was a year or two ago when you were when it was broken out. Is that still the pace at which is just continuing to grow or is that as it matures, slowing down a little bit or is it accelerating any granularity or any color on that?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. It continues through odd pace. I'd say it moves around depending on some of the on-premise renewals that still flow through the P&L, high single digits, low double-digits. And what we've done is continued to -- the team continues to drive kind of the core CRD offerings, the -- start with an equity product. It's moved to equity and fixed income, which are now industry, I think, industry at peer levels, in some cases, industry-leading. And then what we've done is supplemented that. For example, we purchased a small company called Markidis [ph], which was kind of a front-end portion of a Charles River type offering. And so we've added a kind of private market area to what I'll call the broader Charles River Complex. So this is an area that I think will continue to grow probably twice the rate of State Street -- it will help lead us forward but also as the tip of the spear of how we engage with clients, new clients, existing clients in broader ways. And that's why the core software, I think, is an important product. And what I think I've been pleased with, especially this year, which has been all over the place economically and politically, right, even with the equity markets up and down, software and software growth, core Charles River, data, private software for private continues to grow in this double-digit range. Low double-digit range through thick and thin, and that helps balance out, I think, the growth dynamic of the company.\nVivek Juneja: Great, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. 1That will be for our last question. I'll be turning the call over back to Mr. Ron O'Hanley for closing remarks.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Thank you, operator and thanks to all for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ronald P. O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you Ilene and good morning everyone. 2022 was an unpredictable year for many of the world's investors and the people they serve. Despite a market rebound in the fourth quarter, 2022 was the worst year for financial markets since the global financial crisis. Both fixed income and equity markets impacted by the war in Ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds including bulk of supply chains, price and wage inflations, dramatically higher global interest rates, U.S. dollar strength, and heightened fears of global economic recession which remain today. The uncertainty created by these factors contributed to a meaningful year-over-year decline in global financial markets as well as increased market volatility impacting flows. Despite these difficult macro conditions, State Street performed well. As a result, we continued to progress in 2022 towards achieving our medium term targets. Our durable 4Q and full year 2022 results were driven by a strategy underpinned by our relentless focus on innovation, the power of our distinct value proposition, and State Street's diversified products and services, all of which continue to resonate with clients as demonstrated by yet another year of strong, organic net new servicing wins.  As we continue to execute against our strategic agenda, we achieved a great deal in 2022. Slide 3 of our investor presentation shows our full year highlights and the progress we made towards achieving our strategic goals in 2022. In a challenging operating environment and compared to what was a very strong year for our business in 2021, we again delivered positive total operating leverage, pretax margin expansion, and a higher return on equity as you can see on the left of the slide. We drove continued business momentum, including 1.9 trillion of total new asset servicing wins, delivered total revenue growth, and demonstrated ongoing expense discipline in the face of inflationary pressures and our continued investment in the resiliency and capabilities of our businesses, as you can see on the right and bottom of the slide. While weaker average market levels created fee revenue headwinds for our investment servicing and asset management businesses in 2022, our balance sheet businesses combined with higher interest rates and our deposit strategy produced materially higher net interest income as compared to 2021. In addition, our foreign exchange trading services and front office software and data businesses produced double-digit year-over-year fee growth, manifesting the desired results of our investments in these businesses and demonstrating the revenue diversification of our business model. Turning to Slide 4 of our presentation, I will review our fourth quarter highlights. Business momentum was solid in the fourth quarter with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to 434 billion driven by broad based wins across client segments. We reported two new alpha mandates in the quarter and expanded 12 existing alpha relationships, seven of which added additional back and middle office offerings. Helped by this sales performance our AUC/A installation backlog was 3.6 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors quarter end assets under management totaled 3.5 trillion, supported by another good quarter of ETF inflows. Turning to our fourth quarter financial performance, 4Q 2022 EPS was 1.91 or 2.07 excluding notable items, up 7% year-over-year or 4% higher year-over-year excluding notable items. The year-over-year EPS growth in a challenging market environment was supported by the resumption of common share repurchases in the fourth quarter as we focused on returning capital to our shareholders. Even in a year marked by economic and political disruptions, total revenue for the fourth quarter was the highest on record, increasing 3% year-over-year as lower total fee revenue was offset by very strong NII result which increased 63% relative to the year ago, primarily driven by higher global interest rates plus our balance sheet positioning and effective execution of our deposit management strategy. As we meaningfully invested in our people and business, we remain focused on expense discipline in the fourth quarter with total expenses down 3% year-over-year or flat year-over-year, excluding notable items, in part supported by the stronger U.S. dollar. This was achieved by our relentless and ongoing focus on operational productivity, simplification and automation. Turning to our balance sheet and capital, our CET1 capital ratio increased to a strong 13.6% at year end. Recognizing the importance of capital return to our shareholders and having already announced a 10% per share increase to our common stock dividend earlier in 2022, we resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter, buying back a total of 1.5 billion of State Street's common stock. For 2023, it is our intention to return up to 200% of earnings in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. We expect our business mix, balance sheet strategy, and earnings momentum will enable us to do so while maintaining prudent capital ratios within our target range. Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock purchase program of up to 4.5 billion through the end of 2023.  To conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased to be reporting the third year in a row of pretax margin expansion and higher return on equity, which demonstrates the successful progress we have made towards achieving our financial goals. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail before I discuss our strategic priorities for 2023. Thanks, Eric. As we enter 2023, we see an uncertain environment. On the positive side, many supply chains have been repaired, the outlook for energy supply is better than anticipated, particularly in Europe, and developed world inflation may have peaked. We proceed continued rising interest rates in the short term, but at a slower pace. The most significant known risks are geopolitical, including the Russia Ukraine War, China from an economic performance and policy perspective, and the United States as it approaches its debt ceiling. Turning to Slide 17, even with another year of economic and geopolitical uncertainty ahead of us, we continue to be very clear in our strategic priorities for 2023 focusing on what we can control. We plan to deliver further growth, drive innovation, and continue to enhance shareholder value as we further progress State Street towards its medium term targets. First, we are targeting further improvements in our business growth and profitability by leveraging State Street's alpha value proposition and enhancing its private markets capabilities. As we aim to become the leading investment service or platform and enterprise outsource solutions provider in the industry, we intend to maintain and extend our leadership positions in a number of key businesses. In global markets, we aim to expand wallet share as a leading provider of liquidity, financing, and research solutions to investment professionals. At Global Advisors, we aim to build on our strengths in areas such as ETFs and cash, while organically accelerating growth efforts in fast growing segments where we can win.  Second, as we have over the past several years, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization as we build out a simplified, scalable, configurable end-to-end operating model. As we lead with client service excellence, productivity will become a core differentiator of our value proposition. Third, we must continue to build a higher performing organization. We are strengthening execution skills and increasing accountability, thereby fostering an even more results oriented culture required for future growth. Our fourth priority is supported by and the intended outcome of the first three priorities and is aimed at achieving our financial goals, meaning another year of positive operating leverage, margin expansion, and higher returns.  To conclude, supported by our distinctive value proposition and diversified offerings, as well as our ability to manage State Street through challenging environments, I believe that we will be able to execute on each of these strategic priorities in 2023 as we advance towards achieving our financial goals, all while being an essential partner to the world's investors and the people they serve. And with that operator, we can now open the call for questions. Hi, Betsy. Betsy, it's Ron. Maybe I'll take that. I mean, we've obviously got a pattern of investments that we're intending to execute. We've also got an ongoing program in place that we've really had running now since 2019. So we certainly -- if the environment were to change materially, we would think about those investments. We would also think about being more aggressive. I mean, we have more or less in the background, continued to take a lot of gross expense out of the system every year. We see an ongoing ability to do that, but we also want to keep investing in the business. So there is a balance there. But to the extent to which things started to go south in an unanticipated way, I mean we do have levers. Ken, I mean, as we've always said, we've got a very clear strategy and M&A is not a strategy. M&A is a way to help execute a strategy, to move it faster, to enable it to get further than was anticipated. But it's not a strategy by itself. We are very comfortable with our organic strategy. BBH was a scale enhancing acquisition that we would have liked to have done, but it doesn't materially change. In fact, it doesn't change at all our strategy. So at this point, where we sit, we have a strategy that we like. We have a strategy that we're executing against. There are some big milestones that we're confident we're going to be delivering on in 2023. And therefore, we are committed to that share buyback. Yes. Brian, it's Ron. The mutual fund to ETF shift, the -- I mean there's been some high-profile conversions of mutual funds to ETFs. But that's -- there's not a lot of that going on. More typically, what you're seeing is ETFs being added to lines. And yes, the economics are different, the revenues fees are lower, but also particularly when you're at scale like us, the expenses are much lower. So it's not meaningful in this overall revenue kind of guide that we're giving you. Yes. Let me start on that, [indiscernible] there's a lot in there. A comment on -- I'm not going to comment on past restructurings, I'll comment on this one, right. We've made some changes to the way we organize ourselves. We talked about that back in the middle of the year. And there's some benefits we can take out of that in terms of simplifying the management structure, having a smaller number of senior managers, we're going to take advantage of that. It's consistent with simplifying our business. It creates accountability and we stand by the need have done that restructuring. In terms of where do we take this business going forward, it's -- it has a lot of benefits to it. It's very tied to investment markets over time. Investment markets grow, they don't shrink. So the actual, if you will, unit pricing while the unit pricing may go down, overall pricing actually -- overall revenue is actually more times than not have the tailwind. We like that business. It's also one that is changing fundamentally from being a kind of a back office, show me the lowest price kind of thing to much more of an enterprise outsourcing business. We are very new in that. We're very early in that transition. And we think by far, we are the best positioned to take advantage of that in terms of the technical capabilities that we have, the people capabilities that we have, the position we have in the marketplace. We've made initial in roads and wins in that, but there's development that we talked about that will be delivered in 2023 and beyond, but a lot of it in 2023 that will only help strengthen our position. So we see the end game here in terms of the core investment servicing business as being one which is much more akin to an outsourcing services business, much less susceptible to kind of these instantaneous, I'm going to put it to RFP. And it's just a stickier business. And we are very respectful and wary of our competitors because having an edge and a lead can be easily caught up on. But we -- right now, we believe we have that edge and lead, we're going to capitalize on it. In the investment management business, again, similar kinds of changes there. We're seeing an increased desire for the kinds of things that we do, systematic and otherwise. Asset allocation, which we are very, very good at is now an area that everybody is talking about after literally decades of reliance on the 60-40 model, and guess what, it didn't work or it doesn't work at all time. It will lead to a lot of thinking and demand for that. So we like our businesses. We like where we are strategically. In terms of what's going to happen, will there be other Brown Brothers out there. What I do think that you will see over time is an increasing number of competitors where this may not be their core business saying enough is enough. The capital requirements are -- in terms of the investment capital requirements are much too high, mostly above the technology. If it really does continue into an outsourcing kind of environment like we believe it will, it's going to put more demand to invest in the business. And if this is business 42 of your 80 business structure, you might decide you don't want to be in this business. So that's how we see it going forward. Yes, Rob, I mean in terms of fully installed Alpha clients, the retention rate is 100%. And you wouldn't expect it to be much less than that simply because it's still relatively new. I think that there's a real commitment that's made on both sides of the house when you enter into these things. First of all, to actually rewire the firm around -- for the client to rewire around front to back. There's a lot of effort on their part. And while there's a lot of commonality across these clients, there's a lot on our part that we need to do to install it. So contracts are longer. But the reality is that the switching costs have also gone up dramatically in these front-to-back things. So we would expect more. But we also recognize that we've got to earn that. I mean we've got -- right now, there's a -- when that happens, there's a huge dependency on the part of the client and us delivering every day. And so we take that responsibility quite seriously. Yes Vivek, it's Ron. Let me just add to that because we've done a lot of innovation in this area of new product development, and we do expect that to continue to grow as Eric said, because what -- everybody is interested in simplifying their operations, simplifying and getting control of their tech depth and innovating on the technology side. But in addition, there's a data management, data control in some parts of the world with some investors, it's also location of data. Where does the data actually both move and rest. So this is sitting increasingly -- this is a growth area. It goes beyond asset managers, large asset owners in particular very interested in this. So we see it as a way to extend what we're doing broadly in the Alpha arena. Thank you, operator and thanks to all for joining us."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognized in the quarter outlined on Slide 5. First, we recognize acquisition and restructuring costs, including wind down expenses related to the Brown Brothers Investor Services acquisition transaction, which we are no longer pursuing. Second, we recognize 70 million of repositioning costs consisting of an employee severance charge of 50 million to eliminate approximately 200 middle and senior manager positions, largely related to our investment services business as we continue to streamline our organizational structure. We also recognized 20 million of occupancy charge in the quarter to help us further shrink our occupancy costs. We expect these actions to generate a total run rate savings of roughly $100 million. Lastly, we recognize the benefit of 23 million in the quarter related to the settlement proceeds from a 2018 FX benchmark litigation resolution, which is reflected in the FX trading services GAAP revenue line. Taken together, we recognize notable items of $78 million pretax, or $0.16 a share.  Now, turning to Slide 6, I'll begin my review of both our fourth quarter 2022 and full year 2022 results. As you can see on the top left of the table, despite the dynamic and challenging operating environment, the diversity and durability of our business model allowed us to finish the fourth quarter with solid results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 3% year-over-year or 5% year-over-year, excluding notable items, as lower fee revenue was more than offset by robust NII growth of 63%, which I'll spend more time discussing later in today's presentation. We also continued to demonstrate prudent expense management, which enabled us to deliver positive operating leverage in the quarter and pretax margin is up more than four percentage points year-on-year, while ROE is up more than a percentage point this quarter as well. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2022 performance. Notwithstanding the challenging operating environment, we saw in 2022 for the year, I am quite pleased that we again delivered positive operating leverage and nearly a percentage point improvement in pretax margin. As Ron mentioned, it has been three consecutive years of margin expansion and ROE improvement.  Turning to Slide 7, during the quarter we saw period end AUC/A decrease by 16% on a year-on-year basis, but increased 3% sequentially. Year-on-year the decrease in AUC/A was largely driven by continued lower period end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition, and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased as a result of higher quarter end equity market levels and the positive impact of currency translation.  At Global Advisors, we saw similar dynamics play out. Period end AUM decreased 16% year-on-year and increased 7% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels, some institutional net outflows, and the negative impact of currency translation, which was partially offset by 22 billion of net inflows in our SPDR ETF business. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was primarily due to higher quarter end market levels, ETF net inflows, and the positive impact of currency translation, partially offset by cash net outflows.  Turning to Slide 8, on the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average market levels, lower client activity adjustments and flows, normal pricing headwinds, and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of the currency translation, servicing fees were down 10% year-on-year. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 1%, primarily as a result of the client activity adjustments and flows.  On the bottom panel of this page, we've included some sales performance indicators which highlights the good business momentum we again saw in the quarter. As you can see, AUC/A wins in the fourth quarter totaled a solid 434 billion driven by strong broad based traditional wins across client segments and regions, including expanding relationships with existing alpha clients. At quarter-end AUC/A won but yet to be installed totaled $3.6 trillion, with alpha representing a healthy portion, which again reflects the unique value proposition of our strategy.  Turning to Slide 9, fourth quarter management fees were 457 million down 14% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average market levels and the negative impact of currency translation, which represented about two percentage point headwind. Quarter-on-quarter management fees were down 3%, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, notwithstanding the difficult and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop in the year, our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our continued strong business momentum. In ETFs we saw solid full year net inflows in the U.S. with continued momentum and market share gains in the SPDR low cost equity and fixed income segments.  In our institutional business, there's a continued momentum and defined contribution with 48 billion of inflows in the full year, including target date franchise net inflows of 21 billion, offset by industry wide outflows in Institutional Index products. In our cash franchise, we still gained 60 basis points of market share in money market funds in 2022, even though first half inflows reversed in fourth quarter.  On Slide 10, you see the strength of our diverse revenue growth engines with both FX trading services and software and processing up double-digit teens year-on-year in a difficult year. Relative to the period a year ago, fourth quarter FX trading services revenue ex-notables was up 15%, primarily reflecting higher FX spreads partially offset by lower FX volumes. Our global FX franchise was able to effectively monetize the less liquid market environment which was driven by sharp moves in the U.S. dollar. Sequentially FX trading services revenue ex-notables was up 8%, mainly due to higher direct and indirect revenue. Securities finance performance in the fourth quarter was more muted with revenues up 1% year-on-year. Sequentially revenues were down 6%, mainly reflecting downward pressure on spreads due to lower special activity and year-end risk of activity by clients.  Fourth quarter software and processing fees were up 16% year-on-year and 17% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenues associated with CRD, which were up 28% year-on-year and 25% sequentially. Lending fees for the quarter were down 10% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix and flat quarter-on-quarter. Finally, other fee revenue of 18 million in the fourth quarter was flattish year-on-year and up 23 million quarter-on-quarter, largely due to the absence of negative market related adjustments.  Moving to Slide 11, on the left panel you'll see fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased 28% year-on-year, primarily driven by multiple on-premise renewals and continued growth in software enabled revenue associated with new client implementations and client conversions to our cloud based SaaS platform environment.  Turning to some of the front office and Alpha business metrics on the right panel, the 21 million of new bookings in the quarter was once again well diversified across client segments, including asset owners, wealth and private markets as well as across asset classes, particularly in fixed income. Front office revenue, backlog and pipeline remains healthy, giving us confidence in the future growth of this business. As for Alpha, we are pleased to report to two new Alpha mandate wins this quarter in the insurance and asset owner of client segments.  Now turning to Slide 12, fourth quarter NII increased 63% year-on-year and 20% sequentially to 791 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short and long term market interest rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower deposits. We have a well-constructed balance sheet including both U.S. and foreign client deposits, a scale of sponsored repo franchise, and high quality loan and investment portfolio that was consciously configured to benefit from rising global rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by higher global market rates working through our balance sheet. On the right of this slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Year-on-year average assets declined 6% and increased 3% sequentially, primarily due to deposit levels as well as currency translation impacts. The U.S. client's deposit beta, excluding some new deposit initiatives was about 65% to 70% during the fourth quarter. Foreign deposit betas for the quarter were much lower in the 20% to 50% range depending on currency. Our international footprint continues to be an advantage. Total average deposits were up sequentially. We saw sequential quarter reduction in non-interest bearing deposits of 5% which was more than offset by higher NII accretive interest bearing deposits that will help support high quality client loan growth and selective expansion of the investment portfolio. Turning the Slide 13, fourth quarter expenses excluding notable items were once again proactively managed in light of a tough fee revenue environment and flat year-on-year or up approximately 3% adjusted for currency translation. We have been carefully executing on our continued productivity and optimization savings efforts which generated approximately 90 million in year-on-year growth savings for the quarter or approximately 320 million for 2022, achieving near the top end of our full year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4%. These savings enabled us to drive positive operating leverage and pretax margin expansion, which while partially offsetting continued wage inflation headwinds and continued investments in strategic parts of the company, including alpha, private markets, technology, and operations automation. On a line by line basis compared to 4Q 2021 compensation employee benefits were down 1% as the impact of currency translation and lower incentive compensation was partially offset by higher salary increases associated with nearly 6% wage inflation and higher headcount. Headcount increased 9%, primarily in our global hubs as we added operations personnel to support growth areas such as alpha and private markets, invested in technology talent, and in sourced certain functions. There was also a portion of the headcount increase associated with some hiring catch up post COVID. We expect headcount to increase more modestly in 2023. Information systems and communications expenses were down 5% due to benefits from our insourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was up 1%, mainly reflecting higher broker fees and market data costs, partially offset by lower sub custody costs related to lower equity market levels. Occupancy was down 17% largely due to an episodic lease back real estate transaction associated with the sale of our data centers which was worth approximately 12 million. And other expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher professional fees and travel costs. Moving to Slide 14, on the left side of the slide we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels relative to our requirements. At quarter end, standardized CET1 ratio of 13.6% increased 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by episodically lower RWA, partially offset by the resumption of share repurchases in the quarter. With respect to RWA's, it's worth noting that we saw unusually low RWA this quarter worth about $10 billion, largely driven by our markets, businesses and some specific currency factors. We would anticipate a similar amount of normalization of RWA in the 10th $15 billion range going into first quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6% at quarter end, was down 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the resumption of share repurchases in fourth quarter.  We were quite pleased to return $1.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter, consisting of a 1.5 billion of common share repurchases and 220 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as Ron mentioned earlier, we announced this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock repurchase program of up to 4.5 billion through the end of 2023. And as I said in December, we expect to execute this buyback at pace and get back to our target ranges for both CET1 and Tier 1 leverage market conditions and other factors dependent. Turning the Slide 15, let me cover our full year 2023 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have significant potential for variability given the macro environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect some point to point growth in global equity markets in 2023, which equates to global equity markets being down about 2 percentage points year-on-year on a full year average basis. Our rate outlook for 2023 largely aligned with the forward curve, which I would note is moving continuously. However, we currently expect to reach peak rates of 5% per Fed funds, 3.25 at the ECB, and 4.5 at the Bank of England.  As for currency translation, we expect the U.S. dollar to be modestly stronger than the major currencies on average, but less than what we saw last year. As such, currency translations like to have 0.5 point or less impact on both revenues and expenses. In light of the macro factors I just laid out, we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be flat to up 1% ex-notable items with servicing fees likely flattish and management fees down a bit, largely due to a modest reclassification of revenue, other fees, and NII. Regarding the first quarter of 2023, we currently expect fee revenue to be down 1% to 2% ex-notable items on a sequential quarter basis, given some normalization of foreign exchange market volatility that impacts our trading business with servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and management fees expect to be down 1% to 2%. We expect full year 2023 NII to be up about 20% on a year-over-year basis after a very strong 2022. This is dependent of course on the outcome of rate hikes and deposit mix and levels. After a significant step up in fourth quarter 2022 NII, we expect first quarter 2023 to be flattish. And after the first quarter of 2023, we expect to see a slide 1% to 2% of sequentially quarterly attenuation of NII throughout the remainder of 2023, then with the stabilization expected in 2024. Turning to expenses, as you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex-notables will be up 3.5% to 4% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven partially by wage and inflationary pressures and continued investment in the business and our people, while still driving positive operating leverage. You can also see on the walk that for a full year 2023, we expect growth saves of approximately 3%, which will help offset inflationary pressures and variable costs and ongoing investments in areas like private markets and alpha and further automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2023, on a year-over-year basis, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be up about 2%. Finally, taxes should be in the 19% to 20% range for 2023. This outlook would deliver a fourth consecutive year of margin expansion and advances us towards our medium term target goal of 30%, as well as deliver positive operating leverage and strong EPS growth for our shareholders. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Glenn, it's Eric. We've navigated through interest rate cycles before, right, and so we have a fair amount of internal data. And we also have, I think, an engagement with our clients that really understands the multiple avenues for them of putting their cash. Clients broadly with us have $1 trillion of cash, some of that's in deposits, some of that's in our sponsor repo program. Some of that's in our global advisers, money market complex, some of it's in our suite products in our State Street Global Link franchise. And so what we're seeing is that clients are shifting gently their deposits between different categories. But they also need an outlet for that cash. They need an outlook for that cash at a reasonable price, at a reasonable ability to move it and use it as necessary. So with that as a context, I think we continue to see some expected rotation out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, that's been happening, I think, at a reasonable pace and kind of in line more or less with what we've seen before, and we expect that to continue for the next few quarters. At the same time, clients do have cash, especially given the risk-off environment but in general, they all sit on cash as part of their investment planning. And we found that they're engaged with us to leave cash in our balance sheet. They like the flexibility. They like some of the pricing. And obviously, some cash comes in at noninterest-bearing, some at lower rates when it's very transactional, some at rates that are closer to market levels. And so it's an ongoing engagement with them and the visibility we have is reasonably good. It can always change. But deposits as a result, seem to be in the zone now after couple of quarters in the first half of the year of coming down a bit, seem to be flattening out. I won't say that we won't see a little bit of seasonality occasionally in January until February, we see a downtick. And then March folks prepare for tax payments is up and then April is down. So we'll see some of that kind of movement. But on average, we expect deposits to be flattish from -- going forward into next year and through the bulk of the year. Sure. This is part of the, I think, innovation heritage that we have here at State Street across the franchise, but inclusive of the global markets area. We -- our sponsored repo program, which is now $100 billion in size, was started in I'm sorry, in 2005, I think, if I go back to the history books. And there's now a $100 billion franchise, right, as an example. And we do this in FX, we do this in sec lending. Venturi is a repo offering that instead of working through our balance sheet or one of the clearing corporations, which is how we do repo today actually directly connects lenders and borrowers of securities and cash. And so it's just another platform, so to speak, another venue that clients seem to want to engage with. A big part of it early on is working with the asset owners, those who are -- have long booked securities and cash. And what we find is sometimes when they may want to make margin calls for -- or have margin calls, they want to raise cash without selling securities, right. And so a natural question of well, where do I repo, do I repo through a bank structure, or do I repo with someone who's on the other side of that trade, right, who actually wants to lend against securities. And so we find that there are counterparties on the other side of that trade, who would be interested in doing that. And what a Venturi does is it actually connects borrowers and lenders with direct access to one another. So they have both the underlying collateral as the stabilizing force. And then they have the counterparty rating. And with different counterparties, you get slightly different pricing and sometimes that flow-through is actually positive and quite appealing both to the lenders and borrowers. So that's a little bit of it in a nutshell. We like to grow it to some amount during the course of the year, early returns are positive. But it's -- I'll put it in a bucket of innovation and how to connect folks in the capital markets, but connect folks who our core clients and provide additional services for them. That's all right. But we want to be transparent and sometimes language always matters, as you say. Our perspective is we've got a very nice step-off point from fourth quarter NII. We said we'd be roughly flattish into the first quarter. And then we expect it to trend downwards, so attenuate downward, let's say, 1% to 2% for the next few quarters. Just as you see you see a tailwind of interest rates creating a positive but you see that continued rotation out of net interest bearing deposits being a headwind. And the net of that is down NII we think 1% to 2% for a couple of quarters. And then towards the end of the year and into 2024, we see rough stabilization probably because we've kind of burned out on the noninterest-bearing rotation, and then we get to a more stabilized area. But all in, we expect full year NII to be up about 20% year-over-year, and we'll take it from there. Yes. Roughly about half of that comes in, in 2023. The payback on most of these actions is about five quarters so roughly half comes in on a fiscal 2023 basis. And then we'll hit the run rate, I think, within quarters, whatever, sixish or something after these actions, most of these actions are in the next few let's call it the next quarter. The run rate then builds to $100 million. So good payback and the kind of actions we want to keep taking in this kind of environment. Yes, I think maybe just to answer that in the various components. I think you saw the BlackRock transition begin at the end of last year was $10 million in the quarter, sort of call it, a $40 million run rate. That continues to transition out in 2023 and in 2024, there's obviously just a natural schedule that you expect that we've worked closely with them on. And so it'll impact our servicing fees during 2023, during 2024, and into 2025, just when you think about the year-on-year comparison basis. I think if you want to model it out broadly, we've said in our last regulatory filing, we said it was worth about two percentage of fees as of the December 31 pointer we just crossed. It's now about 1.7% of fees. And I'll let you sort of build it from there. But it's included in our forecast. It will continue to be included in our forecast. We think about net new business, right, we've got to sell. We always have a bit of attrition, and we'll -- we want to continue to be net ahead. And as you've seen us in the last couple of years, we've been net positive with net organic growth broadly. And then with BlackRock, specifically, they continue to be a very important client of ours. We have continued and kept a good amount of business that we do with them. We're strong providers for them in alternatives, which is growing quickly. And we've also been awarded new business over the last year. And so that will just -- I think it will just be part of the outlook that I give you as we go forward. Yes. Alex, if you -- I think I tend to spend a little more time on the full year to full year kind of servicing fees, it sounds like you're modeling the last four quarters and then the next four quarters, which obviously model as well, and we have in our budget. It's really a combination of factors, right. So there is -- on a -- if you start with fourth quarter of 2022 and then work forward, we expect some appreciation in equity markets. We'll see if that plays out, and we'll obviously stay in touch with you all. We think that will be a tailwind. We think client flows and activity, in particular, should not be a headwind like it was in 2022, maybe neutral, maybe a positive just as clients have adapted to this new environment. And so we see the new year -- this new year as a time when they're going to be trading, investing, building positions. So we'll see if that plays out, that will be part of it. Then we have net new business. And so we do have a good pipeline both in the traditional servicing and Alpha area. And I think as part of that, we continue to mine our existing client base because the share of wallet growth can be positive there. And then finally, there's always some amount of normal pricing headwinds, but that's factored in. But you kind of have to go through those four areas. And remember, we're assuming some growth in equity markets on a point-to-point basis but we'll see if that plays out. Yes. Let me describe it as follows. The investment portfolio has an average duration of a bit over two and half years, so call it average maturity of five years. And so you go through the math, and that means about 20% of it rolls on, rolls off in a typical year. It will move around a bit. I think what we found, and that's invested across the curve, it's invested in various currencies, so there's a mix. So you tend to get as you have rolled-off, rolled-on somewhere between 1%, 1.5% to sometimes 2.5% tailwind for that particular quarter of the amounts that are rolling off and rolling on. And so that's what's actually been one of the factors that's in billing the yields and the yield improvement on the profile and both how it was designed and what we're pleased to see. So that will be a gentle tailwind assuming five-year rates stay more or less where they are and European rates continue to float up. And so we'll just have to -- that will be one of the tailwinds that we see.  In terms of more dramatic action, we obviously always think about what we might do. What we've noticed is that if you have high risk-weighted asset positions in your risk-weighted asset-intensive positions in your portfolio, then what happens, you could take the loss, you reinvest, and it helps accelerate a buyback, right. That's why I think a number of players are doing that. Doing the -- just the -- for vanilla instruments, treasuries, agencies, government-guaranteed securities, there's -- I think the benefits are a little closer to a push. We could take some losses through the P&L. They're already in the equity accounts through AOCI, you put on NII in the future. I think that's just moving around of the financials, and we just don't find that that's a particularly compelling trade to do. We'll always evaluate well. So we see if we have specific positions that might need some adjustment. But we don't see that as particularly compelling. It's not really compelling economically. And the financial benefits you guys can kind of model out either way. And so we -- I think we're pleased with the ability to continue to manage the portfolio in line with our current processes, and they've been numerous. The NII is up significantly this past year and up another 20% next year, and we've got a tailwind and it -- I think it bodes well for where we are and where we're going. Yes, let me do it in reverse order. The U.S. versus foreign currency betas in our experience, this cycle, prior cycles, do tend to run at different levels, partly because the U.S. has the structure of noninterest-bearing versus interest-bearing deposits. So the client deposit betas are in a subset of the total and partly because the international markets just operate a bit differently, how we're paid and how that -- those expectations have been set over, I'll call it, decades for the industry, operate differently. So I think for the -- as we look into the next few quarters, we think the U.S. client deposit betas ex any new money that we bring in on an initiative basis is going to be in that 65% to 70% and the international betas, we think will continue in the 20% to 50% range when you look at Euros, Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollars, Aussie Dollars and some of the other currencies. So we think they're kind of in the -- they're going to be in this zone and that gives us some ability to continue to take advantage of the interest rate increases.  If I then work through the other part of your question, what happens with rate cuts, that's in our expectations, that's in the forward curves, especially for the U.S., that there could be a December cut. There's some probability there could be a cut before that. I think it doesn't dramatically affect because they are late in the year. The rate cuts don't dramatically affect the NII forecast, so we'll kind of take it as it goes. I do think you're -- as you're intimating, there's a bit of this offset, which is if the Fed's cutting rates, and there's probably going to be even more cash that clients keep on hand and deposits in the system, there'll probably be some offsetting impact. And obviously, with the U.S. betas higher, conveniently rate cuts actually at some point help with the NII as well. So I think there's a fair amount of -- there's a range of scenarios, let's call it, in the second half of next year. And so my guess is, Brian, we're going to be having this conversation often with you. And we'll certainly keep you posted as we see some of those scenarios develop or there's more variability. Yes, Brian, I think the pricing experience that we're seeing in the industry has been stable and consistent over the last few years, and we expect it to be consistent into next year and beyond. We just have the standard because our contracts are tied to equity markets, when they roll over every four, five, six years, typically, folks are thinking whether they expect equity markets to be. They know we're going to get paid, they're going to pay us more in the coming years, and they want to share some of that. And so there's a partial pricing offset. But it's in the 2% headwind per year on servicing fees and been relatively consistent. Brennan, it's Eric. The answer is yes and yes, right? If you think about it, we forecasted just you guys just as you have earnings and coming through the P&L, AOCI in that range, $120 million to $200 million a quarter, it bounces around a little bit and it may with movements in rates. But the pull apart has been good to us and will be a nice tailwind. There's some normalization of RWAs, which I mentioned into the first quarter, then there is some RWA growth in our plans because we want to continue to lend more to clients and support more with their foreign exchange or hedging activity so we'll continue to do that. And then there's the buyback. And our plan is just to at pace, get back into our range and that authorization comfortably gets us there. Yes, let me do it this way. I think as we've -- we have been relatively consistent here and I think the guidance will hold a 10% average change in let's call it, an increase in equity markets, right, will typically lead to about a 3% increase in servicing fees, if you have both of those on average. So that's the kind of gearing we have. It's higher on management fees, 10% higher equity and markets tend to be closer to a 5% increase in management fees.  On the expense side, if I -- it moves around a bit, but I think it's a 10% average increase in equity markets. Probably close to let's say around -- the range around a percentage point increase in expenses could be a little bit less, it kind of depends. But our subcustodian costs are -- have a gearing towards equity markets and fixed income markets, market data, in some cases, does as well.  So it could be half a point, could be a point, and that's part of the what we have in the expense walk and outlook that we have given and in some ways I think we are actually pleased to see that particular expense increase because that particular expense increase comes with a real revenue growth and that's – and that delivers EBIT and earnings growth when you bring it all together. Alright, well the -- crystal balling into 2024, I got to tell you, we've got a lot of variability playing out right now, whether it's economic, whether it's central banks. And I think I know there's a lot of talk about what's happening in NII, where do we go to, and then does it -- what happens after we get to a peak. So, I was just trying in 2024 to kind of level set that we see stability. There's a scenario where you see growth. There are scenarios where we may not. But it's hard, it's -- you're getting far out on our forecasting and predictions to be honest. So let's come back to that maybe in the middle of the year, that will be a good conversation.  In terms of noninterest bearing, you saw noninterest-bearing on average was about $44 billion this quarter. This quarter, meaning fourth quarter, it was down 5% sequentially. It's bounced around quarterly but we see -- I don't know, you could have off the $44 billion, you could have a $4 billion rotation out next quarter. You could see that again into the next quarter. Then it starts to -- or it could be $3 billion and then $2 billion and so on and so forth. So we're -- I think we're at this level where we've seen some amount of rotation. We think it's going to continue roughly at the pace that it's been going. So it could be anywhere between $2 billion, $3 billion and $4 billion a quarter, but you could have some changes to that. What we do think is that we'll continue to see some of it in the first half of the year, and then it just starts to slow down into the second half. And what we've done is to use that kind of base case into our modeling. And it's all factored into the 20% increase in NII that we expect for next year. Yes. All fair and it's a kind of discussion we have internally. We want to front-load the buyback. You saw us start particularly strong this past quarter. And we want some amount of front loading. On the other hand, it's actually quite stabilizing to the stock to have buybacks on a consistent basis. So, I think we're -- we don't want to front load at an extreme, and we don't want to be ratably flat through the year at the extreme either because it gives, I think, it's a good kind of market practice to have some I'll call it, front loading, but reasonable consistency in the buyback as well. I think then the goal is to get into our target range at pace. And then we'd love to operate in the middle of our range over time. That's kind of how a range is set up. But I think what we always have to do is look out on the horizon is are the economic conditions worsening, right? And so then you may be want to run close to the upper end of the range to insulate and prepare or are they particularly benign and they're particularly good uses of capital, and you might want to be at the lower end. Similarly, I think we'll learn more about Basel III and some of the changes in capital rules, maybe that comes with other changes in capital rules, we don't know. And I think later this year, we'll evaluate and that's another reason to either run towards in different areas of the range as well. So, it all factors in, but I think we're quite comfortable with the direction where we want to go and then like you will -- we'll think about what's on the horizon and plan for that. Gerard, we did. And I think what the accelerated share repurchase program typically does is operate in such a way that the stock buyback is accelerated within the course of the quarter, right, within the three-month period. There are typically some benefits of that. You tend to add $0.01 or around that EPS. It's actually interesting in a high interest rate environment, you also lose the NII benefit of the capital. So we've actually found that the ASRs tend to be a push roughly. And so we're -- we often do a more typical buyback within the available trading days in the quarter in a way that's fairly market practice as a way to return the cash and the capital to all of you. It will depend on -- let me say it this way, we want to return the capital at pace and I've given some bookends as to what that means. And that's, I think, a forecast you guys can build off of. And we want to get to our target range, we don't want to wait until, I don't know, next Christmas. That's not the -- that would not be at pace in my nomenclature. At the same time, there's just a range of what will move. If RWAs lighten again, it'll take a little longer. If they go back and we fully utilize our limits in our various businesses and areas, then it might be a little more quickly. So it's hard to pin it down, but as I said, we'd like to get to -- we'd like to execute the buyback at pace. We'd like to get back to a range -- into a range at pace and we're going to -- we're driving that direction. Mike, it's Eric. All good questions. I think that this section in the industry, which used to be variable cost intensive, right, it was very manual, and when you add a new piece of business, you actually have to hire fund accountants. We're working on ledger paper first and then on the Excel sheets next. And so it's quite manually intensive and variable in nature. It's actually as we've automated, think about the data centers, you've talked about the movement to the cloud, the developers that we have, this business has really evolved to a fixed and semi-fixed cost oriented business in truth. And that means that for certain types of business, we bring on custody business, core custody. Those are kind of the most automated and the most the oldest part of what sits in our franchise, that comes in, you plug it in, and the computers just process a few more times, not overnight, but literally in nanoseconds. And so this has become a more fixed cost business. And so what we need to do is think about how do we want to manage those fixed costs, how are they deployed, the development dollars and technology, how do we shape that each year because we can -- if we do that right, we'll add feature functionality and that will bring in new business over time, that will help retention and that will help growth.  And so this is more of a fixed cost business and semi-fixed costs. Where is it? It's more 80-20 fixed and semi-fixed than 20-80. And I think it actually has evolved. And so what's important for us to do is to make sure that we have the products and the offerings and the client coverage to support that and to add new business, add the right type of new business. And then where there are variable cost components, we've talked about some of the more manual and complex areas. Servicing for private, for example, is still quite manual, it's complicated. They are not standard systems. Typically, in the industry, there are no -- there's very little in third-party software that one could avail oneself of, those are the variable areas where we need to continue to find ways to automate and streamline and that's part of what we're doing with the ongoing investment program that we have underway. As we have said, the pipeline remains strong. I think we're pleased with wins this year. Wins were about $1.9 trillion for the full year. What I have said is and I think we feel good about this target or line in the sand as we've said, to drive the kind of organic growth that we'd like we want to win about $1.5 trillion per year of new business. We did that this past year, we did it in space closer to double that in 2021. And so -- and that's our expectation. We expect and we think that's par for 2023 as well. Obviously, we want to sell more than that. We want to bring in new -- more new clients or further deepen relationships with existing clients. I think what we feel good about here is both the new business this year, the $1.9 trillion that has come in has come in at good fee rates. The fee rates of the new wins are actually in line with our overall fee rate this year. And so that means that as it on-boards it will be neutral or even accretive to the fee rate. So that's important and that's an important part of the program. In terms of segments, it's been broad-based. I mean this past quarter, for example, was broad-based across regions, literally, I think it was a third, a third, a third and we saw particularly strong growth this past year in Asia. We'd like to repeat that again. I think we got -- we have an intensity on Europe and North America as well. So there's not -- I'd say it's not one particular segment or one particular region. It's fairly broad. But it's a good pipeline overall. Yes. Let me just clarify. RWA was lower than expected in the fourth quarter by about $10 billion. And in first quarter, we expect it to reverse, in other words, to move back up by $10 billion, $12 billion, $15 billion. And it's just driven by some of the underlying volatility in our business. For example, overdrafts were lighter than expected this quarter. They moved around by a few billion dollars, and that moves RWA by a few billion dollars each quarter. In the FX book, we run a very sort of a typical forward book 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks forward. And as you have U.S. dollar appreciation or depreciation, you can get you can get $5 billion moves in RWA relatively easily. So that's just the volatility that we saw. We tend to be quite careful to stay within our RWA internal limits. That's why we tend not to have upswings in RWA, but we tend to have these beneficial quarters now and then. And we'll just note them to you so you can model out our capital ratio trends. Sure. It's a combination. I mean, the bulk of that is really around Charles River and the franchise that we purchased back in 2018, which has really given us the kind of growth that we had expected. So you can go back and compare the size of the franchise, I think at the last disclosure. I think we probably showed it a year ago and compare it to that software and data line and get a kind of an adjustment. But it's the large majority, I'll say, of that line. Data to us is though a very appealing offering that supplements what's in -- sometimes sold with the Charles River offering sometimes with Alpha and the middle office, sometimes sold as supplemental to just custody and accounting because it's such a high-value and informative kind of window, sometimes for risk management purposes, sometimes for client transparency purposes for our asset manager or asset owner clients. And so it's actually one of the faster growing areas of that area. And that's why we've put it together because it's actually a software type sale, but an important one. Yes. It continues through odd pace. I'd say it moves around depending on some of the on-premise renewals that still flow through the P&L, high single digits, low double-digits. And what we've done is continued to -- the team continues to drive kind of the core CRD offerings, the -- start with an equity product. It's moved to equity and fixed income, which are now industry, I think, industry at peer levels, in some cases, industry-leading. And then what we've done is supplemented that. For example, we purchased a small company called Markidis [ph], which was kind of a front-end portion of a Charles River type offering. And so we've added a kind of private market area to what I'll call the broader Charles River Complex. So this is an area that I think will continue to grow probably twice the rate of State Street -- it will help lead us forward but also as the tip of the spear of how we engage with clients, new clients, existing clients in broader ways. And that's why the core software, I think, is an important product. And what I think I've been pleased with, especially this year, which has been all over the place economically and politically, right, even with the equity markets up and down, software and software growth, core Charles River, data, private software for private continues to grow in this double-digit range. Low double-digit range through thick and thin, and that helps balance out, I think, the growth dynamic of the company."

Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRon O’Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. 2022 continues to unfold like no other year in recent memory with the challenges faced today arising partly out of, but acutely different from, those the world faced in 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. And while the global operating environment continues to be very challenging, our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the resilience of our business model and our focus on maintaining and further improving State Street's pre-tax margin, which was a solid 29% in the third quarter, excluding notable items.  During the third quarter, financial markets were negatively impacted by the adverse effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds, including continued price and wage inflation, dramatically higher interest rates, significant U.S. dollar strength, and heightened fears of a global recession. These factors collectively drove heightened uncertainty which contributed to meaningful declines in both global equity and fixed income markets, as well as increased market volatility, which in turn impacted flows.  We continue to carefully navigate the business for this environment. While the operating climate created a number of fee revenue headwinds for our business in third quarter, the savings and efficiency of our Alpha and enterprise outsourcing offering makes our value proposition even more attractive to asset managers and asset owners in the current market and inflationary environment. We maintained a solid balance sheet and strong capital position, delivered significant NII growth as well as healthy FX trading revenues, and remained laser focused on intensely managing what we can control as demonstrated by our expense management.  Turning to Slide 3 of our presentation, I will review our third quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Starting with our financial performance, third quarter '22 EPS was $1.80 or $1.82, excluding notable items, compared to $1.96 or $2.00, excluding notable items in 3Q '21. Double-digit year-over-year declines in average global equity market values drove most of this decrease.  Total fee revenue for the third quarter declined 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. Within total fee revenue, our global markets franchise once again continued to perform well, with FX trading services and securities finance revenues increasing 14% and 4% year-over-year, respectively, as the business was able to benefit from increased volatility while supporting our clients.  We also drove a solid result within front office software and data, with third quarter revenue increasing 9% year-over-year. Total revenue for the third quarter declined just 1% year-over-year, as lower total fee revenue was largely offset by a very strong NII result which increased 36% relative to the year ago period, driven primarily by higher interest rates.  Faced with continued market-related fee revenue headwinds and inflationary pressures, we remain focused on controlling expense growth. Even as we invested in our people and business, third quarter total expenses were flat both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and expense management.  Business momentum was solid in the third quarter with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to 233 billion. Encouragingly, our third quarter wins include expanded relationships with two existing Alpha clients, demonstrating our ability to broaden and deepen client relationships and drive new back office mandates through our Alpha strategy. As a result of this quarter's solid sales performance, AUC/A 1 but yet to be installed was 3.4 trillion at quarter-end. Front office and data also experienced good business momentum in the third quarter, with annual recurring revenue increasing 20% year-over-year to 267 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled 3.3 trillion. Overall, third quarter AUM flows and management fees were negatively impacted by weaker equity and fixed income markets, but we still saw positive net flows into our cash, SPY and U.S. low cost ETF products during the quarter. Even in a volatile environment, our global institutional money market business has continued to gain market share this year, with AUM reaching a record level of third quarter having experienced four quarters in a row of inflows. We remain excited by our Global Advisors strategy and the growth potential of franchise, and announced new leadership in the third quarter as Yie-Hsin Hung will become our SSGA's new President and CEO in December.  I would now like to turn to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman's Investor Services business, which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The current regulatory environment for M&A transactions involving G-SIBs is challenging. We are engaged in ongoing dialogue with U.S. and international banking regulators regarding the prolonged regulatory review process. We have developed with BBH proposed modifications to the transaction, including changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and a reduction to the purchase price.  We anticipate that a modified transaction would be somewhat more complex and include a delay in timing and amount of deal synergies, resulting in a slower path to accretion. While discussions with regulators on the proposed modified transaction are ongoing, the likelihood of a successful outcome is increasingly uncertain. There can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will be agreed and entered into, or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for a modified transaction. The modifications to the transaction remain subject to review and approval by both BBH's partners and our Board of Directors.  As previously noted, the sale and purchase agreement allows each of State Street and BBH the right to terminate the transaction upon written notice without a contractual penalty at any time. We continue to believe the strategic rationale for the transaction remains compelling and that has encouraged us to continue to seek an acceptable path forward. These efforts are actively underway. And as we previously stated, we expect to reach a decision on whether the transaction can proceed forward during this quarter.  Turning to our balance sheet and capital. Despite a continued rise in interest rates, our CET1 capital ratio was a strong 13.2% at quarter-end. As I have noted previously, we recognize the importance of capital returned to our shareholders and it remains an integral component of our medium-term targets. Accordingly, having already announced a 10% per share increase to our quarterly common stock dividend earlier this year, we now intend to repurchase approximately 1 billion of State Street's common stock in the fourth quarter under the existing common stock repurchase program authorization, which expires at the end of 2022.  Additionally, and keeping with our medium-term targets, it is also our intention to return greater than 80% of earnings in 2023 in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to approval by our Board of Directors and market conditions at the time. If the proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services does not progress, we would expect capital return to be significantly more than that amount. To conclude, the events of the last two and a half years have demonstrated the resiliencies of State Street's business model during times of heightened market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. Even as financial markets broadly declined in the third quarter, we delivered a healthy pre-tax margin of 29%, excluding notable items, in addition to solid new business wins. While the environment is challenging and uncertain, we remain confident in our ability to continue to successfully execute against our strategic agenda, and improve our operating model and financial performance over the medium term for the benefit of our clients and shareholders. As we look ahead, we will continue to adapt to the highly uncertain environment by remaining intensely focused on managing what we can control as our solid expense discipline in 2022 to date has demonstrated with year-to-date total expenses flat to the same nine-month period in 2021 even as we invested meaningfully in our people and business.  And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.80 or $1.82, excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, as detailed in the panel on the right of the slide. As you know, the operating environment in the third quarter remained challenging with persistent market volatility related to ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, rapidly rising interest rates and concerns about the global economy.  Despite these challenges, as you can see on the left panel of this slide, strong growth in both net interest income and our FX trading services business enabled us to partially offset the significant headwinds from lower equity and fixed income markets in the quarter. Additionally, we continue to demonstrate prudent expense management in the third quarter even as we experienced ongoing price and wage increases, while we continue to invest in the franchise. Turning to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw a period end investment services AUC/A decreased by 18% on a year-on-year basis and 7% sequentially. The year-on-year change was largely driven by continued lower period end market levels across equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations.  The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely a result of these same factors. Similarly, at Global Advisors, period end AUM decreased 15% year-on-year and 6% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels, institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation, which was partially offset by positive net flows in both our ETF and cash businesses.  Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see third quarter total servicing fees down 12% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels, lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business.  Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down 9% year-on-year. Even with the negative impact of the market environment in the quarter, I would highlight that we're pleased to see good double digit growth in our private markets businesses. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 6% primarily as a result of these same drivers.  Lastly, we recorded traditional custody wins worth 233 billion in the quarter with attractive fee rates across key client segments. And we now have more than 3.2 trillion of assets to be installed, a good portion of which are attributed to large Alpha deals that were won over the past year. Given our large backlog, we installed approximately 250 billion of assets this quarter, which is in line with our historical pace.  Turning to Slide 7. Third quarter management fees were 472 million, down 10% year-on-year primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels, a previously disclosed client-specific pricing adjustment, institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by the absence of the impact of money market fee waivers and positive net ETF and cash inflows.  Management fees were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds and the impact of currency translation. Notwithstanding the challenging backdrop in the quarter, while we did see some outflows in our ETF business due to an exit of a low yielding Asia Pacific fund, our franchise still remains well positioned for growth.  In ETFs, we saw sustained ETF inflows into the SPDR low-cost suite and fixed income funds. In our institutional business, there's continued momentum in defined contribution with third quarter inflows of 10 billion, including the target date franchise. In our cash business, top quartile performance on our government money market fund was a major driver of net inflows which contributed to market share gains in the institutional money market funds.  On Slide 8, FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the period a year ago, third quarter FX trading services revenue was up 14% primarily driven by higher FX spreads driven by higher market volatility and the recent regulatory capital changes, partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Quarter-on-quarter FX trading services revenue was down 4% as the benefit of higher FX spreads was more than offset by lower client FX volumes which tend to be lower in the summer months.  Securities finance performed well in the third quarter with revenues up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher spreads due to higher specials activity, only partially offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances due to falling market levels. Sequentially, revenues were up 3%, mainly reflecting higher agency spreads.  Third quarter software and processing fees were up 2% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher front office software revenues associated with CRD, which were up 9% while lending fees were down 11% due to changes in product mix. Finally, other fee revenues of negative 5 million in the third quarter declined on a year-on-year basis, largely due to negative market-related adjustments. Sequentially, we saw an increase in other fee revenues, primarily reflecting fewer negative market-related adjustments.  Moving to Slide 9, let me provide some details on the performance of the front office software and data revenue in the third quarter on the left panel of the slide. Front office software revenues increased 9% year-on-year as our more durable and recurring software enabled revenue continues to grow nicely, driven by new client implementations and continued success in converting clients to a cloud-based SaaS platform environment. Sequentially, revenues were up 1% due to higher software enabled revenue partially offset by lower professional services revenue. Our revenue backlog remains healthy.  Turning to some of the CRD and Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we continue to be pleased with our new bookings for the business. The 14 million of new bookings from this quarter was well diversified across client segments, particularly wealth and asset owners, demonstrating the benefit and breadth of clients the platform can now support. As for middle office, we continue to have extremely healthy uninstalled revenue backlog of over 100 million which is up 50% on a year-on-year basis, as I mentioned earlier.  Now turning on Slide 10. Third quarter NII increased 36% year-on-year and 13% sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates from central bank hikes only partially offset by lower client deposits. More than 40% of this increase was driven by non-U.S. dollar rates, as we saw central banks globally raise interest rates.  On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. As a result of a rapidly changing rate environment, industry-wide deposits have begun to trend lower and we are seeing some of this play through our balance sheet as well. Excluding the impact of currency translation, average deposits were down 5% both year-on-year and sequentially, primarily driven by the global tightening in monetary policy by central banks and by the impact of significantly lower market levels on AUC/A. The investment portfolio is down modestly as we continue to manage duration and we now have more than 60% in HTM. As today's results reaffirm, our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to recognize this interest rate and NII tailwind and also protect AOCI.  Turning to Slide 11. Third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were once again proactively managed in light of the revenue environment and flat year-on-year or up approximately 4% adjusted for currency translation and notable items. We've been carefully executing on our continuing productivity and optimization savings efforts, which generated approximately 80 million in year-on-year gross savings or approximately 230 million year-to-date, which puts us in line to achieve our full year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4% of the expense base.  It also contributed to our year-to-date positive operating leverage, which we also expect to deliver for the full year. These savings in addition to benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar enabled us to offset some of the wage inflation we have been seeing in the industry, while we continue to invest in the strategic parts of our company, including Alpha, private markets and operations automation.  On a line-by-line basis compared to third quarter '21, compensation and employee benefits were down 1% as the impact of currency translation was partially offset by higher salary costs associated with wage inflation and higher headcount. Headcount increased 6%, primarily in our Poland and India global centers as we invested in foreign technology capabilities and added operations town [ph] to support new products and services in growth areas such as Alpha, private markets and in middle office servicing. There was also a portion of the headcount increase associated with some hiring catch up post COVID. We expect headcount growth to start to level off.  Information systems and communications expenses were down 2%, as we began to see benefits from our in-sourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was down 10%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs related to equity market movements. Occupancy was down 5%, largely due to currency translation. And other expenses were up 17%, primarily reflecting higher securities processing costs, marketing costs, travel costs and foundation grants. Moving to Slide 12. On the right side of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We're pleased to report CET1 of 13.2%, up 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by higher retained earnings and well controlled RWA. With respect to RWAs, there is volatility and I would caveat that they were lower than we expected this quarter. We would anticipate some RWA increases that we continue to both optimize the balance sheet and efficiently put capital to work across our businesses.  Third quarter Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.4% was up 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the decrease in balance sheet size and higher retained earnings. As the slide highlights, our capital position is strong and our commitment to being stewards of shareholder capital remains steadfast. In keeping with that commitment, we returned 232 million to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends.  And as Ron highlighted, we now intend to repurchase approximately 1 billion of State Street's common stock in the fourth quarter. This higher than expected buyback amount is based on our healthy capital levels and our expected future uses of capital. The AFS, mark-to-market and OCI this quarter amounted to $170 million negative as compared to minus 0.5 billion in 2Q '22, meaningfully improved as a result of the management actions we took despite another strong run up in interest rates this quarter.  Turning to Slide 13, we provide a summary of our third quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance. Even with the current macroeconomic environment and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, our strong growth in net interest income and FX trading services enabled us to partially offset another quarter of significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets, highlighting the resiliency of the franchise, and our expenses remained well controlled, demonstrating our laser focus on productivity.  Turning to our outlook, let me share our current thinking regarding our fourth quarter and some of our macro assumptions as we look over the remainder of the year. At a macro level, while market rate expectations have been volatile, our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests a year end Fed funds rate of 4.5%. We expect other international central banks to continue to raise rates in 4Q and beyond into 2023 as well.  Our outlook assumes 4Q equity market levels will be flat to the September month end, which would imply a 10% quarter-on-quarter decline in global daily average equity markets in 4Q. We also expect continued U.S. dollar strength to be worth about 1 percentage point of headwind and a tailwind to expenses on a quarter-on-quarter basis, which is included in our guide. So, in terms of the fourth quarter of 2022. Given the expected decline in average global equity market levels, we expect total fee revenue to be down about 3% on a sequential quarter basis, with servicing fees down 4% to 5% quarter-on-quarter and management fees down 8% quarter-on-quarter.  Turning to NII. Following yet another strong sequential increase in NII in 3Q, we expect to deliver additional NII growth of 4% to 10% quarter-on-quarter driven by the tailwind from U.S. and foreign central bank rate hikes. This outlook includes our expectation for some continued deposit outflow in 4Q. For the full year, we now expect NII to increase 28% to 30%, which is better than our prior full year guide of 24% to 27%. We also expect continued good growth in NII in full year 2023.  Next, we expect total expenses, excluding notable items, to be roughly flat quarter-on-quarter despite inflationary wage pressure, as we continue to target productivity initiatives in the face of a challenging environment for fee revenue. This focus should enable us to drive positive total operating leverage and a healthy pre-tax margin for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Full year expenses are expected to be flat versus last year. Finally, we would expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19% for the quarter.  And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRon O’Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, there. So maybe just a wrap up question on BBH, and I appreciate all the transparency along the way, but regulators hate it, more complex, market values have fallen. I definitely went with you on the strategic merits. But I guess the question people have is why not just walk away? It seems like you could do some really creative stuff with the capital now. And at what point do you just say, not worth it, not as good creative, too complex, enough said?\nRon O’Hanley: Glenn, it's Ron. Maybe needless to say, we go through that calculus that you're describing every day. And that's part of what led to this. Obviously, the regulatory environment is driving the timeframe here. But what's driving our work is that tradeoff, the tradeoff between the opportunity to consolidate on a global basis a very attractive firm versus what's the alternative uses of the capital, including returning it back to shareholders. We believe there's still the possibility that we can get this -- we can structure this transaction in a way that it will work out for shareholders and to achieve that strategic objective. But as we've said in the disclosure, the likelihood of that happening is going down. So I think what you can take away from this is one of the reasons that's driving that decreased probability is the calculus that you're describing.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Well, I guess we don't have to wait that much longer. So I can chill out for another couple of months. Just one follow-up on, I think you mentioned 60% of the securities portfolio has been moved into held to maturity. It shows in the smaller AOCI hits as rates go up. What's the other side of it? Like can you calculate what the NII give up or any other offsets to moving that larger piece into held to maturity?\nEric Aboaf: Glenn, it’s Eric. We’ve carefully considered what portion of the investment portfolio move to held to maturity and in what amounts. But we do as we make that consideration is the benefit is that you largely don't give up NII, right? By and large, you're earning the coupon on whether they're treasuries or agencies or MBS, just in a different accounting form and structure, but the earnings of the corporation are the same and that's what's quite attractive about HTM. The reason why you wouldn't put the whole portfolio in HTM is partly you want some flexibility, you want from time to time rebalance the portfolio, and you might want to rebalance 5, 10, 15 yards and that takes an AFS construct under which to do it. And then partly you want to make sure that you always have monetization at the front end to maximize and to maintain the liquidity contract you'd like. We've now put that in place. We can repo HTM securities in size. We test that in the marketplace. So we're quite comfortable. But there's a point where you say, look, I'd rather sit on cash or I'd rather sit on available for sale until we feel like we're at a good balance now that really provides a real positive NII trajectory and you see that. We've got it now to 28% to 30% up in NII this year. And I've also started to signal that we're positive on the NII trajectory in 2023, and partly because the entire investment portfolio, whether it's an AFS or HTM is contributing to that upswing.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks, Eric.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKen Usdin: Hi, good morning, guys. I wanted to come back to putting the deal into context with the buyback that you announced, which you would have been clearly saying you'd want to get back into the buyback this quarter. So can you just help us understand the $1 billion sizing and if that has anything to put in context with your thoughts around how the pricing and eventual outcome if the deal goes through might end up coming through? Or is it completely separate and just based on where capital sits regardless of the deal outcome?\nEric Aboaf: Ken, it's Eric. As I said in my prepared remarks, the buyback was larger than anticipated. And part of that is we do two things. We look at our current capital levels, which have trended towards that 13% CET1 mark that we had guided to. Remember that discussion we had in the first quarter. And then because - partly as we consider the capital uses over the next couple of quarters, including the possibility of the Brown Brothers Investment Services transaction. And you would expect us to factor in any downward adjustments or purchase price that we would expect, and that's effectively what we've done. So it's a mix of factors, but those are the components. And I think we're quite pleased. We can now proceed with $1 billion. As Ron said, we're planning on comfortably returning more than 80% of earnings to shareholders next year quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter, which is what our medium-term targets are, and that's still availed us the capacity to do a deal at an admittedly adjusted price if it's appropriate at the time.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And then on the denominator side, I guess of capital, can you just give us a little color on how you'd expect deposits to traject from here, pretty meaningful decline in both interest bearing and non-interest bearing just relative to where you're ending here, just your general outlook on your thoughts around deposit mix and flows? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yes, I think our deposit trends will probably be in line with some of what you're seeing in the industry. I think we're within that zone of -- if you look at the Fed reports, if you look at other institutions, and we've certainly begun to see that rotation out of deposits this quarter, down about 5%, both year-on-year and quarter-over-quarter, adjusted for currency translation. I think what we have seen over the last year is a series of factors that have impacted it, and this is my way to say that I can give you some guidance, but it's going to vary depending on how the factors play out. So you have U.S. dollar appreciation. So you have a -- non-dollar deposits are come down as a result. We have equity markets falling, which means the AUC/As that we custody for are coming down and with that investors, institutions, retail hold similarly lower cash amounts. And so part of what's happening here at the environment is actually affecting deposits somewhat independently of where we are with rising rates and quantitative tightening. Now we are seeing the effects of rising rates and quantitative tightening as well, so I kind of give you that as a background because I think there are four or five factors at play here which is more than expected. I think as we look forward, we continue to expect some deposit outflows in the fourth quarter. We expect those to be somewhat less than we saw in the third quarter. But we do expect some, and those are factored into our NII guide. And one of the reasons why we have a wider NII guide than usual is because there's a range of outcomes. But we're seeing what we expected. We're seeing what we expected as rates rise and we price carefully and maintain, I think, some healthy betas this quarter. We're seeing non-interest bearing begin to flow out with higher rates, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., in particular, you have the difference that clients can earn. And then one of the things we're doing with our clients is to think about the full range of offerings for them. Sometimes it's the base account, sometimes it's special accounts with deposits. If you remember, we've historically put in place deposit initiatives to have the right balance of deposits on the balance sheet. And then the other thing that this is feeding is some of our other businesses, whether it's the cash business in GA, whether it's the repo business, there's a whole set of product offerings that cash flows to that we're pleased to support our clients with. So there's quite a bit going on in this area, more to come. But we're comfortable with some of these forecasts. And what I find particularly important to keep in mind is NII continues to rise, even with some of these deposit outflows. And part of that is the U.S. rate that we're also familiar with, but given that so much of our balance sheet is international, those foreign rate rises are particularly helpful. And those deposits are I think good levels as well.\nKen Usdin: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, Ron and Eric. Good morning, guys. I was hoping we could speak a little bit more broadly around State Street's capital allocation strategy. If BBH does not go through, what's your appetite for any other deals, whether it's in the services space or asset management space? Obviously, macro conditions are pretty volatile. So I'm sure that'll impact that as well. But curious how you thinking about the tradeoff between the accelerating buyback or other deals? And then if you do go down the path of more buybacks, should we be thinking about the upper end of your CET1 and leverage as sort of the target to which you will go to, or you might need to run with a buffer sort of on top of that, given uncertain macro conditions?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, Alex, why don't I begin on this just on how we think about M&A? It's not like we have a shopping list here. BBH is a unique opportunity to consolidate the market on a global basis. And by that I mean it's not just about adding to some particular geography, but it really does bolster us in all the major geographies that we're in. Having said that, we've got our own what we believe is a distinctive, organic strategy in the servicing area, led by our Alpha proposition, which continues to grow. There's a lot of development that was being completed this year and early next year, which will lead to a lot of new onboardings and we think even make the proposition attractive to a broader set of clients. So we always are looking in the marketplace to see if there's something that makes sense, but it's not like the money's burning a hole in our pocket. And if this doesn't work, we're immediately going to go out and come back with something else. Eric, you may want to talk to just how we think about the context of buybacks?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. And Alex, I think I'd add that we're quite conscious that we raised almost $2 billion of equity from our investors and diluted them. We certainly expect that if the deal doesn't proceed that the bulk of our excess capital needs to go back to shareholders. That's deserved and I think expected and we would deliver on that. I think in terms of capital ratios, I had said earlier this year when the economic environment felt more benign and when we had simplified and attenuated a lot of the OCI risk in the investment portfolio that we might be willing to go down to the lower end and even below the lower end of our 10% to 11% range. I think now given the economic uncertainties, we for the time being expect to operate towards the middle of that range. That they might change over time. But for now, I think our current expectation is, we have reduced the volatility in the investment portfolio, which reduces, on one hand, the need for a capital buffer to some extent, on the other hand, the economic environment is much more -- there’s much more volatility in it. And that pushes us in the other direction. But the net of that is that I think we're quite comfortable with the 10% to 11% range and operating somewhere in the middle there.\nAlex Blostein: Great, thank you. That's helpful. My follow-up question maybe around the business side of things, you guys have a very sizable pipeline of installations. And on the servicing side, a lot of them are Alpha mandates, which obviously tend to be a little bit more complex. You talked to us I think on the last call sort of the cadence of how that's going to come through on the revenue side. But I'm just kind of curious how you would contextualize any incremental investments or expenses that will need to come with it, given sort of complexity of those installations over the next 12 to 18 months?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, I'll start Alex on the investments and Eric can talk you through the pattern. On the investments, there is actually ongoing development, as I mentioned earlier, and that development, some of which is being completed this year, some which has been completed next year, but it's all part of our medium-term plan as well as our budget. So there's nothing out of the ordinary that you should expect to do this. And in fact, much of the development is behind us or will be behind us at year end. Within the 3.4 trillion, as you would expect, it's the larger, more complex Alpha mandates, in some cases, their development partners with us where we're developing new features and functionality, which will be available not just to that particular client, but more broadly to the client base. So these are important things to get done right, and we think are a good use of our investment dollars, because they'll result not just in being able to onboard that client, but to be able to broaden the offering.\nEric Aboaf: And then, Alex, I'd add that we certainly need to plan and begin to set up onboarding teams. Those are well underway. And so you saw headcount tick up this quarter. For example, expenses though were well controlled. The headcount was in our hubs and some of the lower cost markets purposely. So we're navigating through that. But some of the expenses have to be put on in advance of as we're doing the onboarding and advance of the installation and the recognition of revenue, and some come as the revenue comes on. But I think, as Ron said, all this is within our expense guidance. It'll be within our expense guidance when we get to that in January for next year. And our view is that we collectively need to continue to drive margins in the right direction, given our medium-term targets. That needs to be a mix of both the revenue lift we're getting from Alpha deals as well as the expense and productivity initiatives, both within the Alpha environment and across the traditional franchise, and all that has to come together to deliver on our financial commitments.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, Ron and Eric. Thanks for taking the questions. I'd like to ask on BBH. It seems somewhat unusual to be getting regulatory approval before the approvals within the company. So why is that happening? And given that there's risk of deterioration, loss of talent, customers, Ron you made reference to this during the last quarter call when you guys first said you were renegotiating. Would you have the ability to adjust price further if this process drags, or has that been set already?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, on the approvals, our Board has been actively involved in this brand as has the BBH partners on their side throughout this process. So obviously, there was an approval before we announced this in September of '21. There's an ongoing consultation with our Board. And we've walked through modifications, but we don't have a final deal yet largely because we have not actually gotten through the regulatory process and figured out what the actual structure would be that will satisfy all of the regulators. So it's not completely binary and that we're not talking to our Board until it's all done. But obviously, our Board needs to see the entire thing in total and be able to make that decision. In terms of the ongoing kind of risk to clients and people, that's there. It continues. We're spending a lot of time with clients. I think I've mentioned before, about half the client base is a shared client base, so the clients that we talk to anyway. I think there's still a strong desire on the part of our clients that if this can be completed in a way that makes sense, they'd like to see it completed. So I do not worry about further client attrition. We obviously are worried about people attrition on both sides, but largely on the BBH side. And we're monitoring that closely. And to the extent to which we felt like after the price reduction we've already negotiated that circumstances have changed sufficiently further that we needed that again. Of course, we would raise that if we needed to do that.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for that, Ron. And then second question is maybe a bit -- well, I'll just come right out. So why is this so strategically compelling? It seemed as though it was largely a scaled deal. Now it's deteriorated. You said earlier Ron that the accretion is probably going to be more drawn out and it's going to be lower than initially planned. It's more complicated. So you're introducing a lot of operational and legal complexity. I get it, you're lowering the price. But is this really a good use of time? Is this really a good use of management focus? Why not just understand that the environment deteriorated, the regulatory approvals didn't come through, it couldn't work as constructed. And so it's better off just to walk.\nRon O’Hanley: Again, I'm probably repeating myself a little bit, Brennan, here but that's exactly what we ask ourselves every day. And you're right. It is taking a lot of management time. I think what's compelling about it is several things. One is its footprint. Many of the things that are out there or supposedly out there or rumored to be out there tend to be single geography kinds of things. And if you have a strong desire to be in that geography, maybe there's something useful there. I would describe at best tactical. This one adds scale to us everywhere where we are and really does set it apart from the other. Secondly, it's got some technology assets that we like. We've talked about those in the past. Third, it's got a set of people and professionals that we believe are equal to and sometimes even better than some of our people. And that's attractive to us. But that has to be weighed against all the factors that you and others have raised here and continue to do that, which is why we're not coming here saying to you, yep, we're ready to go. We're not ready to go. It’s also why we're coming here saying to you that we recognize this has gone on long enough and that we need to bring this to a close this quarter.\nBrennan Hawken: Amen to that. Thanks for all the color.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning. So why don't I ask one clarifying question on NII. Some of your bank peers they've indicated 4Q exit rate could be close to the peak this cycle just as lag deposit pricing begins to catch up with rate hikes. You noted that the '23 NII Eric will be up nicely year-on-year. But do you see the potential for '23 NII coming in above that annualized 4Q level, suggesting that that fourth quarter NII guidance is not going to be representative of the peak?\nEric Aboaf: I think you're trying to get deeply into our 2023 forecasts and I think it's a little premature to do that to be honest. Let's see how deposits flow and evolve this coming quarter. Let's see whether the U.S. central bank and the foreign central banks continue to have the wherewithal to tame inflation because that's important, right, or are they going to -- or not. So it's quite dependent upon all that. I think the reason I made my positive statements about 2023 is that we don't see fourth quarter as the quarterly peak. We think there's more NII upside over subsequent quarters. We also have a balance sheet that has a mix of USD and non-USD and in some cases, we tend to have more foreign deposits. And those are areas if those foreign central banks continue to hike and address the serious inflationary environments in their geographies that give us an additional tailwind that may be different than a U.S. Bank. So there's certainly momentum here. I don't want to get into fourth quarter annualized versus my current view of 2023. But I did say good continuing growth purposely. I think there's more to come on NII. But I think we'll no more than a quarter or two to be honest. But we see a trajectory that is good and reasonably positive, given what we know in the environment today.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that, Eric. So reading the tea leaves, I may scrap my question on the expense growth algorithm and what that implies for next year. But the one area I did want to unpack on expense is the margins in the investment management segment, they're down about 600 basis points year-on-year. That's an area where you made significant progress over the last couple of years. Certainly, you're going to see some pressures given the declining market. But why you get a sense as to how much expense flexibility you have there and where you think you can actually hold the line on the pre-tax margin for that particular business?\nEric Aboaf: I think I'd start answering that question by saying we're actually quite pleased by the progress we've made in growth and margins in the investment management business over, call it, the last three years. I think it had teens level margins, if you go back in time, we got into the 20s. Some of that was the market uptick, which flowed through the management fee line. Some of it was I think delivering strongly on flows and net new revenues was positive across the franchise. Cash as an example continues to be a standout. But each of the three franchises have new products and offerings have been quite good. And I think what the team has done there well is as they have secured those flows, launched those new products, they've also managed the expense base. And so just because it was a tailwind from equity markets or fixed income markets or from flows, they've actually kept expenses remarkably flat in that environment or flattish in that environment, which I think is a testament to how they've navigated the environment. I think what you should expect is that a couple of things. If equity markets continue to operate at this level, we need to continue to work on expenses and productivity becomes an even bigger focus there as it should be across the company. I think on the flipside of that if we get some kind of rebound in equity and fixed income markets that plays through the asset management business financials, I would expect expenses to continue to be disciplined there and margins to certainly go back to some of the higher levels that you saw. But I would say I think at 31% margins, we're quite pleased with where we are and I think there is -- depending on where equity markets go, I think the trajectory will continue in a generally positive direction.\nSteven Chubak: Helpful color, Eric. Thanks for taking my questions.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just one quick clean up on BBH. Can you close that deal if it all works well? Can you close that on December 31 or earlier and buyback the 1 billion? And do you need to have that Tier 1 leverage ratio be within or above your target range? In other words, can you do this and be at say the low end of the target range just temporarily for 4Q or even below?\nEric Aboaf: Brian, it's Eric. I think the timing of this feels quite uncertain given where we are. We've not been able to complete the regulatory process and there's still -- so I think thinking about this in months as opposed to quarters is premature. We've done the buyback calculation though fully considering the reduced price that would be part of a Brown Brothers transaction. And so whether the timing is quarter X or quarter Y, we're comfortable proceeding with $1 billion. We're pleased to get it started in the coming days. And regardless how that plays out, be able to return as I said and as Ron said comfortably more than the 80% that we've committed to throughout next year at a minimum.\nBrian Bedell: That's great. And then just one on the deposit betas. Maybe if you can just talk about or how you see them right now as they exist in terms of like how you're defining them for both the U.S. versus the non-U.S.? And then as we move into next year, maybe sort of an outlook without giving NII guidance, of course, but just sort of a range of where you think the terminal betas could be in the U.S. versus the non-U.S., even if it's a fairly wide range?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, let me describe it this way and let me cover U.S. and non-US because both matter in a positive way for our books. I think the betas this quarter in the U.S. were in the 55% range. We're pleased to see that. Those are up from about 35% last quarter, but exactly where you'd expect us to be where we expect it to be given the uptick in rates. And next quarter if we go from 55% this quarter to 65% betas next quarter would be quite comfortable, and then it just continues to inch up. That's just how it plays through. In euros, we're also in that 50% range as we've started to cross into positive territory for central banks, and we expect that to continue. So part of the reason for the NII forecast into fourth quarter and into next year is that we expect betas in this 50% to 60% range in euros. The market operates a little differently than the U.S., but that would be in the range. And then in pound sterling, betas are lower. They tend to be in the 30% to 35% range there. And then you can keep going; Aussie dollars, Canadian dollars and so forth. And we have a balance sheet that is prepared for rate rises across those currencies as well. And then you'll just see betas notch up quarter-over-quarter. I think at the terminal level, there's always some amount of lagging that you do, that's just how it happens. You never get to 100% beta or anything near that, because you have some non-interest bearing and you have some lag deposits, but we'll see. We're comfortable where we are in the 50% range going to 60% and I think it will play out well for the NII and the balance sheet accordingly.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. Thank you. That’s great color. Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nJim Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Eric, maybe just one last question on NII and I apologize, but as we think about big picture, Fed funds being potentially 20 basis points or more higher than 2018, European rates being positive versus negative back then, do you see anything conceptually to suggest your NIM shouldn't be higher than back then or just want to get your thoughts on that?\nEric Aboaf: Jim, it’s Eric. I'm a little more focused on NII than on NIM. And the reason we've done that is because we've actually changed the shape of our balance sheet over time. Remember we added some deposit initiatives which tend to be at lower NIMs, but they are NII accretive and positive. And we do that because sometimes we want to balance currencies around the balance sheet, we want to raise deposits where we want to land. We need to keep deposits for intraday. There lots of reasons why we have different mix of balancing, and we've done that purposely and in an engaging way with our clients over the last two, three years. So I don't think -- as a result, the balance sheet is bigger. And part of the reason we've allowed it to be bigger is that the leverage ratio is not particularly constraining on us. And so what our intentionality is, is actually to maximize NII as opposed to NIM. So I think as you play that out, I think our NIMs are lower at this point than they were last time in the cycle, and I think they'll likely be below the -- the NIMs will be below the highs of the last cycle. On the other hand, I think if you calculate the forecast we've given you for NII for fourth quarter, so the next quarter that we're about to print, that will be a new high of NII relative to what we had seen in the last cycle. And that's where we're a little more focused, because that's what comes back to shareholders and what creates earnings and earnings momentum that contributes to the bottom line.\nJim Mitchell: Okay, fair enough. And just maybe on the BlackRock ETF transition, how much is left and do you see that as a material -- any kind of a material impact on forward revenues?\nEric Aboaf: Our guidance has been pretty consistent on this. And I think you'll find it in our 10-Qs and Ks that we estimate that the revenue outflow is about 2 percentage points of fees. So that hasn't changed. You saw some of that begin to come out this quarter that was worth about 5 million this quarter. If you kind of get to the full quarter amount, it'll be just under 10 million for fourth quarter. And that was worth about $1 trillion of AUC/A. So that did occur, and we'll continue to keep you updated on that. But as we previously disclosed and talked about, deconversions just take time and it will play out sometime towards the second half of 2023 and then into 2024 will probably be the majority of it, but we'll just see. We're working closely with BlackRock. We continue to be quite pleased with all the existing business we do with them and the work we do for them in the alternative servicing area, which we're one of the largest providers and certainly help them as they want to evolve, diversify and support their other plants.\nJim Mitchell: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good afternoon, Eric and Ron. Eric, can you remind us, you talked a little bit about it in your prepared remarks about fee revenues and the pricing pressure that you see every year. Can you remind us if that number has changed a bit at all? And second, as part of that, I think you've also indicated in the past, you needed a certain amount of assets under custody to neutralize that pressure. I don't remember, I think it was 1.5 trillion, but I could be wrong of new business wins to neutralize that downward pricing pressure?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, let me start that and it is an area that we continue to work on. The pricing headwinds are just a condition of our industry. Why? Because as you remember, pricing is AUM or AUC/A based. And so as equity markets go up, clients expect some of that to come back to them. The pricing headwinds on an aggregate basis in the servicing fee line are about 2 percentage points of headwinds a year. And when we saw that bubble in 2017, '18, '19, that's come back down. That ticked up and then it's been well managed back down to that 2% or so level. And that's what we are seeing today. We're not seeing anything different than that. And it's well within our expectations. In terms of wins, we always want to focus on net new business and for net new business to drive a positive impact on the revenues as they did this quarter. I was clear in my prepared remarks that that net new business was positive. We had some nice wins. We actually had some nice wins and nice fee rates, right, because both matter to your point. The benchmark I've put out there is that we expect about 1.5 trillion of AUC/A wins a year to be in a good positive direction and trajectory for net new business. But to be honest, as the CFO, I always like to see a little more and you've seen last year was particularly strong. This year, year-to-date, I think we're already comfortably at that level, and we still have another quarter to go. So the sales momentum continues. And what I find important is it continues to close both our traditional customer accounting business and our Alpha offerings, and so it's been broad based.\nRon O’Hanley: Gerard, what I would add is on the topic of pricing, we mentioned to you at the end of the second quarter that we launched a targeted repricing initiative that is well underway. And it's focused on the areas of high value or where costs are increasing higher than in other places. And that is intended to and is to achieve margin preservation. In other words, to offset the cost of delivering something high value or to offset the increasing costs in areas, for example, where we have disproportionate market data and things like that. So that initiative is well underway. When we talked to you last time, it had just launched. So we were in the dozens of clients. Now we're in conversations with triple digit number. So we're pleased with that progress too.\nGerard Cassidy: And has it been well received or understood, I should say, nobody likes price increases, but the clients understanding of why this conversation has to take place?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, I think understood is the right word, Gerard. I think that these are sophisticated institutions themselves. They see what's going on. So I think it's been for the most part understood.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then, Eric, as a follow up, can you remind us what percentage of assets under custody or under management are variable rate priced products, meaning your customers paying basis points on the assets under custody? And so therefore, to your point, when the value goes up and down, obviously, it affects revenues.\nEric Aboaf: Yes, it's a bit of a mix across different segments and across geographies, but a good rule of thumb is 50%, 55% are assets under custody base, so move up and down with market. There's another 20% of the pricing tends to be based on transactional activity and we actually saw transactions, volumes, DTCC trades, wire transfers, derivatives, transactions, so forth come down this quarter. And then the last 20%, 25% tend to be relatively fixed or sometimes semi fixed, the number of funds you custody for or some flat fees.\nGerard Cassidy: Gentlemen, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Okay. Next, we'll go to Mike Brown with KBW. Your line is now open.\nMichael Brown: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess on BBH, I suppose it's been a while since we've gotten a financial update on the business and how it's performed in this volatile environment year-to-date. And clearly there's a possibility that we have a resolution that could not end up moving forward with the acquisition. So as we think about our models here and getting those kind of aligned with how BBH is performing, anything you can share on how the company has performed year-to-date?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, we’re obviously monitoring the business performance closely; monthly, quarterly. And I think it's -- you should expect -- you can go back to some of the materials that we had shared a year ago, September, as the base case, but you could take that Mike and extrapolate some of what you've seen in our book of business, right. We're an asset management oriented custodian. You can even look at some of our peers as benchmark. And I think you'd find what we've seen, which is that there's a sharp boost in NII in their book or NII plus fees, because of the mix of programs that they run for their clients cash, partially offset I'd say with some downdraft in servicing fee rates, equity and bond markets. And then you'd see a bit of an uptick on the FX services kind of business. So I think it's ours and other large custodians are parallel to what you've seen. And so it's something worth considering. But as we talked about earlier, we're conscious that we need to think about this from a couple different perspectives, but it's performing in line with what we and you would expect at this point.\nMichael Brown: Okay, understood. Thanks for that color, Eric. Maybe just one last cleanup one for me. How should we think about how the unrealized losses on the AFS portfolio could creep back over the next call it 12 to 24 months as we think about your capital ratio, or how that will impact the capital ratios over that time period?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, it is part of our capital forecasting now. And it was actually included in some of the buyback and capital return estimates that we provided not only for the fourth quarter, but also for our intentions related to next year. I think this quarter the accretion was worth $60 million or so of capital and that's just the reversal of that mark accreting back as the bonds mature. There tends to be a little lumpiness to it, but that's the start of the accretion. And so it did provide some amount of modest tailwind and we'll certainly factor that in, right, because just like earnings create an opportunity to return capital to shareholders, the accretion does as well. And that'll be part of that builder capital ratios, which then we can share back with shareholders.\nMichael Brown: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nMichael Mayo: Hi. Just to clarify, so in the next 10 weeks, we should either expect you to say that you'll proceed with the BBH deal or that you won't be proceeding and maybe they'll be an extra $2 billion buyback. Am I interpreting that correctly?\nRon O’Hanley: What you should take away from what we've said, Mike, is that by the end of this quarter, we will have a decision on whether to proceed forward or not to proceed forward. On the buyback, first, we need a Board authorization for a further buyback and we'll communicate what we're intending on buybacks after that authorization.\nMichael Mayo: Okay. And just I know that the first question of this call was why not just walk away and that's been the topic. Let me just take the flipside. I'm sure you've invested a lot of resources and time and thought into this. Is the real issue just the regulators? And I'm just wondering, it's like roughly what, like 10% of your size? Are other G-SIBs either 10x to 15x larger? When I worked at the Fed 30 years ago, it'd almost be considered de minimis, right? And I'm just trying to figure out the change. We all know the change of mindset as it relates to mergers generally. But I'm just wondering, does this put you at a permanent strategic penalty box that you can't pursue any mergers? Or is it something unique to this deal? Now I know you can't talk particulars about this deal in general. But can you make any broader statements like when [indiscernible] to that, it gets extra scrutiny or it's not as easy to get through anymore?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, Mike, what I would say is that the timing of our announcement in this deal in retrospect probably couldn't have come at a worse time, because if you think about the regulatory agencies, many of them to some extent were going through some kind of personnel change. So that itself has slowed things down. In some cases, it's driven a very significant change in philosophy. Whether that change in philosophy will be permitted or not, I don't know. I'd like to think not. But to answer I think the nub of your question is did anything change from beyond the regulatory situation? The answer is no. For all the reasons that we've stated to going back to September of last year, we feel like the deal is strategically compelling. In terms of longer term, what does this mean for our position? Again, that's something that we think about and that's something that we certainly have conversations about with our primary regulator. And I think there's some sympathy to all that. But I don't want to talk about something in the abstract beyond the transaction that we're in, which is the BBH deal. It's not all regulators, it's a subset. And it’s a situation that we're going to work our way through, but work our way through very cognizant of what it means for our shareholders, what it means for clients, et cetera.\nMichael Mayo: And then last follow up on this, is there anything that you can do to help control the outcome of this at this time? Or is it simply based on the analysis by the regulators?\nRon O’Hanley: Well, we've talked about modifications to the transaction and the modifications are meant to meet either regulatory concern or to navigate -- or to do what we believe is required to navigate through regulatory concern. So that's what we're up to now.\nMichael Mayo: Okay, all right. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Just a couple of quick follow ups. One, I know you've had some M&A charges, merger integration charges over the past few quarters. If any of that is for the BBH deal? Was there anything in a walk away that you would be refunded for? I'm guessing the answer is no, but I just want to make sure I understand how that works.\nEric Aboaf: Betsy, it’s Eric. No, those are incurred charges that are about primarily our staffing and then some of the service providers. But we've also -- what we have done is avoided some of the -- obviously there are costs that are continued on deal closing, some of the advisory fees, et cetera, those have not played through there and those would not be incurred. So those are kind of the base level expenses.\nBetsy Graseck: And then --\nEric Aboaf: There's no tail on those by and large.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. Okay. And is it possible to size how much of those were for or have been for BBH or --?\nEric Aboaf: Since earlier this year, they primarily have been around the BBH transaction work.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then we've had two quarters of very strong dollar performance here, dollar strengthening Q-on-Q. I see it in the deck the ins and outs on the drag on revenues, the benefit to expenses, a little bit of a drag on the AUC/A, AUM volumes. You've got some benefit from volatility and the trading one. So just wanted to get your sense of how has the dollar strengthening all-in impacted you and how do you think about managing? That was just generally speaking. Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Betsy, it’s Eric. What I'd describe to you is that the dollar has an effect as do all of the currencies on our P&L and balance sheet. But it's relatively symmetric and thus I'll say almost neutral. And I say that in EBIT terms and in balance sheet terms. Dollar strengthening reduces revenues, but also reduces expenses, not in all currencies and all the time, but it tends to have almost an EBIT neutral impact on the P&L. And then on the balance sheet, you also have a similar effect where as deposits are revalued downwards and foreign jurisdictions as U.S. appreciates, so are the assets in those jurisdictions. And so you have some symmetry. So by and large, it's I'll call it roughly neutral, which is why we don't do any particular hedging on it, because we find that we can manage through it in a comfortable manner. Except that it makes our reporting to all of you in the investment community a little more complicated, but that's just what needs to happen.\nBetsy Graseck: And when you think about the footprint that you have today and the effort to continue to get scale in that footprint, is the international exposure strategically important from a diversification perspective or do you feel that the growth outlook for the non-U.S. markets is higher, just wondering?\nRon O’Hanley: Betsy, it’s Ron. Let me take that. I would say that we've got a good geographic mix now. And so the way we think about it in virtually all of our locations, it's not like we're not at minimum efficient scale. But to the extent to which we can achieve more scale there, we'd like that. I think in general, the non-U.S. markets have continued in most circumstances, not all to grow faster than U.S. markets on balance. If we could get a little bit more there, we'd like that.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nVivek Juneja: Thanks. Sorry to beat a dead horse, but going back to BBH, given that you talk about buying back $1 billion of stock, the deal value was 3.5 billion, that's a pretty substantial percentage. Would you still be buying the full entity you had intended to when you announced the deal, or is there some elimination of a part of it? And flip it the other way, could you buy just a piece of it or is it only available as a whole thing?\nEric Aboaf: Vivek, it’s Eric. Kind of the outlines, the perimeter of the deal with Brown Brothers hasn't really changed. It's around their investment services business. That's the business that we're attracted to. And that's the one that they'd like to transact. So there's not been any real change there.\nRon O’Hanley: Yes. And Vivek, we were never buying the whole business.\nVivek Juneja: What I meant was the whole investment services business. Could you buy a piece of it since it's different geographies, given the regulatory complexity to sort of, if they're geographies are more attractive and more difficult to replicate on your own?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes, I suppose that's something we could explore, Vivek. Then the attraction goes down even more so. And not clear that that accomplishes what Brown Brothers itself is trying to accomplish, which is they'd like to exit the business not have even a smaller bit than they already have now.\nVivek Juneja: Ron, I want to go back to a different topic. You mentioned about the price increase discussions you're having and you said the operative word is understood with your clients. Should I interpret understood as understood and agreeing to it or understood but not necessarily open to it and shopping it around with other providers?\nRon O’Hanley: So I would say, again, this has been highly targeted, Vivek, so it's not like we've said, there's an X% across the board kind of thing. We've really tied it to one where our costs are under the most pressure. And two, where there's a high value added delivered to the client. And so I think you should interpret understood as -- we understand why you're asking for this. There's certainly some talk around it and is that the right number, et cetera. But I would say in more cases than not, in fact far more cases than not, we're getting agreement on it.\nVivek Juneja: Great. Thank you.\nRon O’Hanley: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Ron O’Hanley for any additional or closing remarks.\nRon O’Hanley: Well, thank you, operator and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. 2022 continues to unfold like no other year in recent memory with the challenges faced today arising partly out of, but acutely different from, those the world faced in 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. And while the global operating environment continues to be very challenging, our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the resilience of our business model and our focus on maintaining and further improving State Street's pre-tax margin, which was a solid 29% in the third quarter, excluding notable items.  During the third quarter, financial markets were negatively impacted by the adverse effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds, including continued price and wage inflation, dramatically higher interest rates, significant U.S. dollar strength, and heightened fears of a global recession. These factors collectively drove heightened uncertainty which contributed to meaningful declines in both global equity and fixed income markets, as well as increased market volatility, which in turn impacted flows.  We continue to carefully navigate the business for this environment. While the operating climate created a number of fee revenue headwinds for our business in third quarter, the savings and efficiency of our Alpha and enterprise outsourcing offering makes our value proposition even more attractive to asset managers and asset owners in the current market and inflationary environment. We maintained a solid balance sheet and strong capital position, delivered significant NII growth as well as healthy FX trading revenues, and remained laser focused on intensely managing what we can control as demonstrated by our expense management.  Turning to Slide 3 of our presentation, I will review our third quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Starting with our financial performance, third quarter '22 EPS was $1.80 or $1.82, excluding notable items, compared to $1.96 or $2.00, excluding notable items in 3Q '21. Double-digit year-over-year declines in average global equity market values drove most of this decrease.  Total fee revenue for the third quarter declined 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. Within total fee revenue, our global markets franchise once again continued to perform well, with FX trading services and securities finance revenues increasing 14% and 4% year-over-year, respectively, as the business was able to benefit from increased volatility while supporting our clients.  We also drove a solid result within front office software and data, with third quarter revenue increasing 9% year-over-year. Total revenue for the third quarter declined just 1% year-over-year, as lower total fee revenue was largely offset by a very strong NII result which increased 36% relative to the year ago period, driven primarily by higher interest rates.  Faced with continued market-related fee revenue headwinds and inflationary pressures, we remain focused on controlling expense growth. Even as we invested in our people and business, third quarter total expenses were flat both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and expense management.  Business momentum was solid in the third quarter with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to 233 billion. Encouragingly, our third quarter wins include expanded relationships with two existing Alpha clients, demonstrating our ability to broaden and deepen client relationships and drive new back office mandates through our Alpha strategy. As a result of this quarter's solid sales performance, AUC/A 1 but yet to be installed was 3.4 trillion at quarter-end. Front office and data also experienced good business momentum in the third quarter, with annual recurring revenue increasing 20% year-over-year to 267 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled 3.3 trillion. Overall, third quarter AUM flows and management fees were negatively impacted by weaker equity and fixed income markets, but we still saw positive net flows into our cash, SPY and U.S. low cost ETF products during the quarter. Even in a volatile environment, our global institutional money market business has continued to gain market share this year, with AUM reaching a record level of third quarter having experienced four quarters in a row of inflows. We remain excited by our Global Advisors strategy and the growth potential of franchise, and announced new leadership in the third quarter as Yie-Hsin Hung will become our SSGA's new President and CEO in December.  I would now like to turn to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman's Investor Services business, which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The current regulatory environment for M&A transactions involving G-SIBs is challenging. We are engaged in ongoing dialogue with U.S. and international banking regulators regarding the prolonged regulatory review process. We have developed with BBH proposed modifications to the transaction, including changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and a reduction to the purchase price.  We anticipate that a modified transaction would be somewhat more complex and include a delay in timing and amount of deal synergies, resulting in a slower path to accretion. While discussions with regulators on the proposed modified transaction are ongoing, the likelihood of a successful outcome is increasingly uncertain. There can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will be agreed and entered into, or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for a modified transaction. The modifications to the transaction remain subject to review and approval by both BBH's partners and our Board of Directors.  As previously noted, the sale and purchase agreement allows each of State Street and BBH the right to terminate the transaction upon written notice without a contractual penalty at any time. We continue to believe the strategic rationale for the transaction remains compelling and that has encouraged us to continue to seek an acceptable path forward. These efforts are actively underway. And as we previously stated, we expect to reach a decision on whether the transaction can proceed forward during this quarter.  Turning to our balance sheet and capital. Despite a continued rise in interest rates, our CET1 capital ratio was a strong 13.2% at quarter-end. As I have noted previously, we recognize the importance of capital returned to our shareholders and it remains an integral component of our medium-term targets. Accordingly, having already announced a 10% per share increase to our quarterly common stock dividend earlier this year, we now intend to repurchase approximately 1 billion of State Street's common stock in the fourth quarter under the existing common stock repurchase program authorization, which expires at the end of 2022.  Additionally, and keeping with our medium-term targets, it is also our intention to return greater than 80% of earnings in 2023 in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to approval by our Board of Directors and market conditions at the time. If the proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services does not progress, we would expect capital return to be significantly more than that amount. To conclude, the events of the last two and a half years have demonstrated the resiliencies of State Street's business model during times of heightened market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. Even as financial markets broadly declined in the third quarter, we delivered a healthy pre-tax margin of 29%, excluding notable items, in addition to solid new business wins. While the environment is challenging and uncertain, we remain confident in our ability to continue to successfully execute against our strategic agenda, and improve our operating model and financial performance over the medium term for the benefit of our clients and shareholders. As we look ahead, we will continue to adapt to the highly uncertain environment by remaining intensely focused on managing what we can control as our solid expense discipline in 2022 to date has demonstrated with year-to-date total expenses flat to the same nine-month period in 2021 even as we invested meaningfully in our people and business.  And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Eric. Operator, let's open the line for questions. Glenn, it's Ron. Maybe needless to say, we go through that calculus that you're describing every day. And that's part of what led to this. Obviously, the regulatory environment is driving the timeframe here. But what's driving our work is that tradeoff, the tradeoff between the opportunity to consolidate on a global basis a very attractive firm versus what's the alternative uses of the capital, including returning it back to shareholders. We believe there's still the possibility that we can get this -- we can structure this transaction in a way that it will work out for shareholders and to achieve that strategic objective. But as we've said in the disclosure, the likelihood of that happening is going down. So I think what you can take away from this is one of the reasons that's driving that decreased probability is the calculus that you're describing. Yes, Alex, why don't I begin on this just on how we think about M&A? It's not like we have a shopping list here. BBH is a unique opportunity to consolidate the market on a global basis. And by that I mean it's not just about adding to some particular geography, but it really does bolster us in all the major geographies that we're in. Having said that, we've got our own what we believe is a distinctive, organic strategy in the servicing area, led by our Alpha proposition, which continues to grow. There's a lot of development that was being completed this year and early next year, which will lead to a lot of new onboardings and we think even make the proposition attractive to a broader set of clients. So we always are looking in the marketplace to see if there's something that makes sense, but it's not like the money's burning a hole in our pocket. And if this doesn't work, we're immediately going to go out and come back with something else. Eric, you may want to talk to just how we think about the context of buybacks? Yes, I'll start Alex on the investments and Eric can talk you through the pattern. On the investments, there is actually ongoing development, as I mentioned earlier, and that development, some of which is being completed this year, some which has been completed next year, but it's all part of our medium-term plan as well as our budget. So there's nothing out of the ordinary that you should expect to do this. And in fact, much of the development is behind us or will be behind us at year end. Within the 3.4 trillion, as you would expect, it's the larger, more complex Alpha mandates, in some cases, their development partners with us where we're developing new features and functionality, which will be available not just to that particular client, but more broadly to the client base. So these are important things to get done right, and we think are a good use of our investment dollars, because they'll result not just in being able to onboard that client, but to be able to broaden the offering. Yes, on the approvals, our Board has been actively involved in this brand as has the BBH partners on their side throughout this process. So obviously, there was an approval before we announced this in September of '21. There's an ongoing consultation with our Board. And we've walked through modifications, but we don't have a final deal yet largely because we have not actually gotten through the regulatory process and figured out what the actual structure would be that will satisfy all of the regulators. So it's not completely binary and that we're not talking to our Board until it's all done. But obviously, our Board needs to see the entire thing in total and be able to make that decision. In terms of the ongoing kind of risk to clients and people, that's there. It continues. We're spending a lot of time with clients. I think I've mentioned before, about half the client base is a shared client base, so the clients that we talk to anyway. I think there's still a strong desire on the part of our clients that if this can be completed in a way that makes sense, they'd like to see it completed. So I do not worry about further client attrition. We obviously are worried about people attrition on both sides, but largely on the BBH side. And we're monitoring that closely. And to the extent to which we felt like after the price reduction we've already negotiated that circumstances have changed sufficiently further that we needed that again. Of course, we would raise that if we needed to do that. Again, I'm probably repeating myself a little bit, Brennan, here but that's exactly what we ask ourselves every day. And you're right. It is taking a lot of management time. I think what's compelling about it is several things. One is its footprint. Many of the things that are out there or supposedly out there or rumored to be out there tend to be single geography kinds of things. And if you have a strong desire to be in that geography, maybe there's something useful there. I would describe at best tactical. This one adds scale to us everywhere where we are and really does set it apart from the other. Secondly, it's got some technology assets that we like. We've talked about those in the past. Third, it's got a set of people and professionals that we believe are equal to and sometimes even better than some of our people. And that's attractive to us. But that has to be weighed against all the factors that you and others have raised here and continue to do that, which is why we're not coming here saying to you, yep, we're ready to go. We're not ready to go. It's also why we're coming here saying to you that we recognize this has gone on long enough and that we need to bring this to a close this quarter. Gerard, what I would add is on the topic of pricing, we mentioned to you at the end of the second quarter that we launched a targeted repricing initiative that is well underway. And it's focused on the areas of high value or where costs are increasing higher than in other places. And that is intended to and is to achieve margin preservation. In other words, to offset the cost of delivering something high value or to offset the increasing costs in areas, for example, where we have disproportionate market data and things like that. So that initiative is well underway. When we talked to you last time, it had just launched. So we were in the dozens of clients. Now we're in conversations with triple digit number. So we're pleased with that progress too. Yes, I think understood is the right word, Gerard. I think that these are sophisticated institutions themselves. They see what's going on. So I think it's been for the most part understood. What you should take away from what we've said, Mike, is that by the end of this quarter, we will have a decision on whether to proceed forward or not to proceed forward. On the buyback, first, we need a Board authorization for a further buyback and we'll communicate what we're intending on buybacks after that authorization. Yes, Mike, what I would say is that the timing of our announcement in this deal in retrospect probably couldn't have come at a worse time, because if you think about the regulatory agencies, many of them to some extent were going through some kind of personnel change. So that itself has slowed things down. In some cases, it's driven a very significant change in philosophy. Whether that change in philosophy will be permitted or not, I don't know. I'd like to think not. But to answer I think the nub of your question is did anything change from beyond the regulatory situation? The answer is no. For all the reasons that we've stated to going back to September of last year, we feel like the deal is strategically compelling. In terms of longer term, what does this mean for our position? Again, that's something that we think about and that's something that we certainly have conversations about with our primary regulator. And I think there's some sympathy to all that. But I don't want to talk about something in the abstract beyond the transaction that we're in, which is the BBH deal. It's not all regulators, it's a subset. And it's a situation that we're going to work our way through, but work our way through very cognizant of what it means for our shareholders, what it means for clients, et cetera. Well, we've talked about modifications to the transaction and the modifications are meant to meet either regulatory concern or to navigate -- or to do what we believe is required to navigate through regulatory concern. So that's what we're up to now. Betsy, it's Ron. Let me take that. I would say that we've got a good geographic mix now. And so the way we think about it in virtually all of our locations, it's not like we're not at minimum efficient scale. But to the extent to which we can achieve more scale there, we'd like that. I think in general, the non-U.S. markets have continued in most circumstances, not all to grow faster than U.S. markets on balance. If we could get a little bit more there, we'd like that. Yes. And Vivek, we were never buying the whole business. Yes, I suppose that's something we could explore, Vivek. Then the attraction goes down even more so. And not clear that that accomplishes what Brown Brothers itself is trying to accomplish, which is they'd like to exit the business not have even a smaller bit than they already have now. So I would say, again, this has been highly targeted, Vivek, so it's not like we've said, there's an X% across the board kind of thing. We've really tied it to one where our costs are under the most pressure. And two, where there's a high value added delivered to the client. And so I think you should interpret understood as -- we understand why you're asking for this. There's certainly some talk around it and is that the right number, et cetera. But I would say in more cases than not, in fact far more cases than not, we're getting agreement on it. Thank you. Well, thank you, operator and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.80 or $1.82, excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, as detailed in the panel on the right of the slide. As you know, the operating environment in the third quarter remained challenging with persistent market volatility related to ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, rapidly rising interest rates and concerns about the global economy.  Despite these challenges, as you can see on the left panel of this slide, strong growth in both net interest income and our FX trading services business enabled us to partially offset the significant headwinds from lower equity and fixed income markets in the quarter. Additionally, we continue to demonstrate prudent expense management in the third quarter even as we experienced ongoing price and wage increases, while we continue to invest in the franchise. Turning to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw a period end investment services AUC/A decreased by 18% on a year-on-year basis and 7% sequentially. The year-on-year change was largely driven by continued lower period end market levels across equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations.  The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely a result of these same factors. Similarly, at Global Advisors, period end AUM decreased 15% year-on-year and 6% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels, institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation, which was partially offset by positive net flows in both our ETF and cash businesses.  Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see third quarter total servicing fees down 12% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels, lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business.  Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down 9% year-on-year. Even with the negative impact of the market environment in the quarter, I would highlight that we're pleased to see good double digit growth in our private markets businesses. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 6% primarily as a result of these same drivers.  Lastly, we recorded traditional custody wins worth 233 billion in the quarter with attractive fee rates across key client segments. And we now have more than 3.2 trillion of assets to be installed, a good portion of which are attributed to large Alpha deals that were won over the past year. Given our large backlog, we installed approximately 250 billion of assets this quarter, which is in line with our historical pace.  Turning to Slide 7. Third quarter management fees were 472 million, down 10% year-on-year primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels, a previously disclosed client-specific pricing adjustment, institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by the absence of the impact of money market fee waivers and positive net ETF and cash inflows.  Management fees were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds and the impact of currency translation. Notwithstanding the challenging backdrop in the quarter, while we did see some outflows in our ETF business due to an exit of a low yielding Asia Pacific fund, our franchise still remains well positioned for growth.  In ETFs, we saw sustained ETF inflows into the SPDR low-cost suite and fixed income funds. In our institutional business, there's continued momentum in defined contribution with third quarter inflows of 10 billion, including the target date franchise. In our cash business, top quartile performance on our government money market fund was a major driver of net inflows which contributed to market share gains in the institutional money market funds.  On Slide 8, FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the period a year ago, third quarter FX trading services revenue was up 14% primarily driven by higher FX spreads driven by higher market volatility and the recent regulatory capital changes, partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Quarter-on-quarter FX trading services revenue was down 4% as the benefit of higher FX spreads was more than offset by lower client FX volumes which tend to be lower in the summer months.  Securities finance performed well in the third quarter with revenues up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher spreads due to higher specials activity, only partially offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances due to falling market levels. Sequentially, revenues were up 3%, mainly reflecting higher agency spreads.  Third quarter software and processing fees were up 2% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher front office software revenues associated with CRD, which were up 9% while lending fees were down 11% due to changes in product mix. Finally, other fee revenues of negative 5 million in the third quarter declined on a year-on-year basis, largely due to negative market-related adjustments. Sequentially, we saw an increase in other fee revenues, primarily reflecting fewer negative market-related adjustments.  Moving to Slide 9, let me provide some details on the performance of the front office software and data revenue in the third quarter on the left panel of the slide. Front office software revenues increased 9% year-on-year as our more durable and recurring software enabled revenue continues to grow nicely, driven by new client implementations and continued success in converting clients to a cloud-based SaaS platform environment. Sequentially, revenues were up 1% due to higher software enabled revenue partially offset by lower professional services revenue. Our revenue backlog remains healthy.  Turning to some of the CRD and Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we continue to be pleased with our new bookings for the business. The 14 million of new bookings from this quarter was well diversified across client segments, particularly wealth and asset owners, demonstrating the benefit and breadth of clients the platform can now support. As for middle office, we continue to have extremely healthy uninstalled revenue backlog of over 100 million which is up 50% on a year-on-year basis, as I mentioned earlier.  Now turning on Slide 10. Third quarter NII increased 36% year-on-year and 13% sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates from central bank hikes only partially offset by lower client deposits. More than 40% of this increase was driven by non-U.S. dollar rates, as we saw central banks globally raise interest rates.  On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. As a result of a rapidly changing rate environment, industry-wide deposits have begun to trend lower and we are seeing some of this play through our balance sheet as well. Excluding the impact of currency translation, average deposits were down 5% both year-on-year and sequentially, primarily driven by the global tightening in monetary policy by central banks and by the impact of significantly lower market levels on AUC/A. The investment portfolio is down modestly as we continue to manage duration and we now have more than 60% in HTM. As today's results reaffirm, our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to recognize this interest rate and NII tailwind and also protect AOCI.  Turning to Slide 11. Third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were once again proactively managed in light of the revenue environment and flat year-on-year or up approximately 4% adjusted for currency translation and notable items. We've been carefully executing on our continuing productivity and optimization savings efforts, which generated approximately 80 million in year-on-year gross savings or approximately 230 million year-to-date, which puts us in line to achieve our full year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4% of the expense base.  It also contributed to our year-to-date positive operating leverage, which we also expect to deliver for the full year. These savings in addition to benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar enabled us to offset some of the wage inflation we have been seeing in the industry, while we continue to invest in the strategic parts of our company, including Alpha, private markets and operations automation.  On a line-by-line basis compared to third quarter '21, compensation and employee benefits were down 1% as the impact of currency translation was partially offset by higher salary costs associated with wage inflation and higher headcount. Headcount increased 6%, primarily in our Poland and India global centers as we invested in foreign technology capabilities and added operations town [ph] to support new products and services in growth areas such as Alpha, private markets and in middle office servicing. There was also a portion of the headcount increase associated with some hiring catch up post COVID. We expect headcount growth to start to level off.  Information systems and communications expenses were down 2%, as we began to see benefits from our in-sourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was down 10%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs related to equity market movements. Occupancy was down 5%, largely due to currency translation. And other expenses were up 17%, primarily reflecting higher securities processing costs, marketing costs, travel costs and foundation grants. Moving to Slide 12. On the right side of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We're pleased to report CET1 of 13.2%, up 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by higher retained earnings and well controlled RWA. With respect to RWAs, there is volatility and I would caveat that they were lower than we expected this quarter. We would anticipate some RWA increases that we continue to both optimize the balance sheet and efficiently put capital to work across our businesses.  Third quarter Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.4% was up 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the decrease in balance sheet size and higher retained earnings. As the slide highlights, our capital position is strong and our commitment to being stewards of shareholder capital remains steadfast. In keeping with that commitment, we returned 232 million to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends.  And as Ron highlighted, we now intend to repurchase approximately 1 billion of State Street's common stock in the fourth quarter. This higher than expected buyback amount is based on our healthy capital levels and our expected future uses of capital. The AFS, mark-to-market and OCI this quarter amounted to $170 million negative as compared to minus 0.5 billion in 2Q '22, meaningfully improved as a result of the management actions we took despite another strong run up in interest rates this quarter.  Turning to Slide 13, we provide a summary of our third quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance. Even with the current macroeconomic environment and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, our strong growth in net interest income and FX trading services enabled us to partially offset another quarter of significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets, highlighting the resiliency of the franchise, and our expenses remained well controlled, demonstrating our laser focus on productivity.  Turning to our outlook, let me share our current thinking regarding our fourth quarter and some of our macro assumptions as we look over the remainder of the year. At a macro level, while market rate expectations have been volatile, our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests a year end Fed funds rate of 4.5%. We expect other international central banks to continue to raise rates in 4Q and beyond into 2023 as well.  Our outlook assumes 4Q equity market levels will be flat to the September month end, which would imply a 10% quarter-on-quarter decline in global daily average equity markets in 4Q. We also expect continued U.S. dollar strength to be worth about 1 percentage point of headwind and a tailwind to expenses on a quarter-on-quarter basis, which is included in our guide. So, in terms of the fourth quarter of 2022. Given the expected decline in average global equity market levels, we expect total fee revenue to be down about 3% on a sequential quarter basis, with servicing fees down 4% to 5% quarter-on-quarter and management fees down 8% quarter-on-quarter.  Turning to NII. Following yet another strong sequential increase in NII in 3Q, we expect to deliver additional NII growth of 4% to 10% quarter-on-quarter driven by the tailwind from U.S. and foreign central bank rate hikes. This outlook includes our expectation for some continued deposit outflow in 4Q. For the full year, we now expect NII to increase 28% to 30%, which is better than our prior full year guide of 24% to 27%. We also expect continued good growth in NII in full year 2023.  Next, we expect total expenses, excluding notable items, to be roughly flat quarter-on-quarter despite inflationary wage pressure, as we continue to target productivity initiatives in the face of a challenging environment for fee revenue. This focus should enable us to drive positive total operating leverage and a healthy pre-tax margin for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Full year expenses are expected to be flat versus last year. Finally, we would expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19% for the quarter.  And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Glenn, it's Eric. We've carefully considered what portion of the investment portfolio move to held to maturity and in what amounts. But we do as we make that consideration is the benefit is that you largely don't give up NII, right? By and large, you're earning the coupon on whether they're treasuries or agencies or MBS, just in a different accounting form and structure, but the earnings of the corporation are the same and that's what's quite attractive about HTM. The reason why you wouldn't put the whole portfolio in HTM is partly you want some flexibility, you want from time to time rebalance the portfolio, and you might want to rebalance 5, 10, 15 yards and that takes an AFS construct under which to do it. And then partly you want to make sure that you always have monetization at the front end to maximize and to maintain the liquidity contract you'd like. We've now put that in place. We can repo HTM securities in size. We test that in the marketplace. So we're quite comfortable. But there's a point where you say, look, I'd rather sit on cash or I'd rather sit on available for sale until we feel like we're at a good balance now that really provides a real positive NII trajectory and you see that. We've got it now to 28% to 30% up in NII this year. And I've also started to signal that we're positive on the NII trajectory in 2023, and partly because the entire investment portfolio, whether it's an AFS or HTM is contributing to that upswing. Sure. Ken, it's Eric. As I said in my prepared remarks, the buyback was larger than anticipated. And part of that is we do two things. We look at our current capital levels, which have trended towards that 13% CET1 mark that we had guided to. Remember that discussion we had in the first quarter. And then because - partly as we consider the capital uses over the next couple of quarters, including the possibility of the Brown Brothers Investment Services transaction. And you would expect us to factor in any downward adjustments or purchase price that we would expect, and that's effectively what we've done. So it's a mix of factors, but those are the components. And I think we're quite pleased. We can now proceed with $1 billion. As Ron said, we're planning on comfortably returning more than 80% of earnings to shareholders next year quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter, which is what our medium-term targets are, and that's still availed us the capacity to do a deal at an admittedly adjusted price if it's appropriate at the time. Yes, I think our deposit trends will probably be in line with some of what you're seeing in the industry. I think we're within that zone of -- if you look at the Fed reports, if you look at other institutions, and we've certainly begun to see that rotation out of deposits this quarter, down about 5%, both year-on-year and quarter-over-quarter, adjusted for currency translation. I think what we have seen over the last year is a series of factors that have impacted it, and this is my way to say that I can give you some guidance, but it's going to vary depending on how the factors play out. So you have U.S. dollar appreciation. So you have a -- non-dollar deposits are come down as a result. We have equity markets falling, which means the AUC/As that we custody for are coming down and with that investors, institutions, retail hold similarly lower cash amounts. And so part of what's happening here at the environment is actually affecting deposits somewhat independently of where we are with rising rates and quantitative tightening. Now we are seeing the effects of rising rates and quantitative tightening as well, so I kind of give you that as a background because I think there are four or five factors at play here which is more than expected. I think as we look forward, we continue to expect some deposit outflows in the fourth quarter. We expect those to be somewhat less than we saw in the third quarter. But we do expect some, and those are factored into our NII guide. And one of the reasons why we have a wider NII guide than usual is because there's a range of outcomes. But we're seeing what we expected. We're seeing what we expected as rates rise and we price carefully and maintain, I think, some healthy betas this quarter. We're seeing non-interest bearing begin to flow out with higher rates, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., in particular, you have the difference that clients can earn. And then one of the things we're doing with our clients is to think about the full range of offerings for them. Sometimes it's the base account, sometimes it's special accounts with deposits. If you remember, we've historically put in place deposit initiatives to have the right balance of deposits on the balance sheet. And then the other thing that this is feeding is some of our other businesses, whether it's the cash business in GA, whether it's the repo business, there's a whole set of product offerings that cash flows to that we're pleased to support our clients with. So there's quite a bit going on in this area, more to come. But we're comfortable with some of these forecasts. And what I find particularly important to keep in mind is NII continues to rise, even with some of these deposit outflows. And part of that is the U.S. rate that we're also familiar with, but given that so much of our balance sheet is international, those foreign rate rises are particularly helpful. And those deposits are I think good levels as well. Yes. And Alex, I think I'd add that we're quite conscious that we raised almost $2 billion of equity from our investors and diluted them. We certainly expect that if the deal doesn't proceed that the bulk of our excess capital needs to go back to shareholders. That's deserved and I think expected and we would deliver on that. I think in terms of capital ratios, I had said earlier this year when the economic environment felt more benign and when we had simplified and attenuated a lot of the OCI risk in the investment portfolio that we might be willing to go down to the lower end and even below the lower end of our 10% to 11% range. I think now given the economic uncertainties, we for the time being expect to operate towards the middle of that range. That they might change over time. But for now, I think our current expectation is, we have reduced the volatility in the investment portfolio, which reduces, on one hand, the need for a capital buffer to some extent, on the other hand, the economic environment is much more -- there's much more volatility in it. And that pushes us in the other direction. But the net of that is that I think we're quite comfortable with the 10% to 11% range and operating somewhere in the middle there. And then, Alex, I'd add that we certainly need to plan and begin to set up onboarding teams. Those are well underway. And so you saw headcount tick up this quarter. For example, expenses though were well controlled. The headcount was in our hubs and some of the lower cost markets purposely. So we're navigating through that. But some of the expenses have to be put on in advance of as we're doing the onboarding and advance of the installation and the recognition of revenue, and some come as the revenue comes on. But I think, as Ron said, all this is within our expense guidance. It'll be within our expense guidance when we get to that in January for next year. And our view is that we collectively need to continue to drive margins in the right direction, given our medium-term targets. That needs to be a mix of both the revenue lift we're getting from Alpha deals as well as the expense and productivity initiatives, both within the Alpha environment and across the traditional franchise, and all that has to come together to deliver on our financial commitments. I think you're trying to get deeply into our 2023 forecasts and I think it's a little premature to do that to be honest. Let's see how deposits flow and evolve this coming quarter. Let's see whether the U.S. central bank and the foreign central banks continue to have the wherewithal to tame inflation because that's important, right, or are they going to -- or not. So it's quite dependent upon all that. I think the reason I made my positive statements about 2023 is that we don't see fourth quarter as the quarterly peak. We think there's more NII upside over subsequent quarters. We also have a balance sheet that has a mix of USD and non-USD and in some cases, we tend to have more foreign deposits. And those are areas if those foreign central banks continue to hike and address the serious inflationary environments in their geographies that give us an additional tailwind that may be different than a U.S. Bank. So there's certainly momentum here. I don't want to get into fourth quarter annualized versus my current view of 2023. But I did say good continuing growth purposely. I think there's more to come on NII. But I think we'll no more than a quarter or two to be honest. But we see a trajectory that is good and reasonably positive, given what we know in the environment today. I think I'd start answering that question by saying we're actually quite pleased by the progress we've made in growth and margins in the investment management business over, call it, the last three years. I think it had teens level margins, if you go back in time, we got into the 20s. Some of that was the market uptick, which flowed through the management fee line. Some of it was I think delivering strongly on flows and net new revenues was positive across the franchise. Cash as an example continues to be a standout. But each of the three franchises have new products and offerings have been quite good. And I think what the team has done there well is as they have secured those flows, launched those new products, they've also managed the expense base. And so just because it was a tailwind from equity markets or fixed income markets or from flows, they've actually kept expenses remarkably flat in that environment or flattish in that environment, which I think is a testament to how they've navigated the environment. I think what you should expect is that a couple of things. If equity markets continue to operate at this level, we need to continue to work on expenses and productivity becomes an even bigger focus there as it should be across the company. I think on the flipside of that if we get some kind of rebound in equity and fixed income markets that plays through the asset management business financials, I would expect expenses to continue to be disciplined there and margins to certainly go back to some of the higher levels that you saw. But I would say I think at 31% margins, we're quite pleased with where we are and I think there is -- depending on where equity markets go, I think the trajectory will continue in a generally positive direction. Sure. Brian, it's Eric. I think the timing of this feels quite uncertain given where we are. We've not been able to complete the regulatory process and there's still -- so I think thinking about this in months as opposed to quarters is premature. We've done the buyback calculation though fully considering the reduced price that would be part of a Brown Brothers transaction. And so whether the timing is quarter X or quarter Y, we're comfortable proceeding with $1 billion. We're pleased to get it started in the coming days. And regardless how that plays out, be able to return as I said and as Ron said comfortably more than the 80% that we've committed to throughout next year at a minimum. Yes, let me describe it this way and let me cover U.S. and non-US because both matter in a positive way for our books. I think the betas this quarter in the U.S. were in the 55% range. We're pleased to see that. Those are up from about 35% last quarter, but exactly where you'd expect us to be where we expect it to be given the uptick in rates. And next quarter if we go from 55% this quarter to 65% betas next quarter would be quite comfortable, and then it just continues to inch up. That's just how it plays through. In euros, we're also in that 50% range as we've started to cross into positive territory for central banks, and we expect that to continue. So part of the reason for the NII forecast into fourth quarter and into next year is that we expect betas in this 50% to 60% range in euros. The market operates a little differently than the U.S., but that would be in the range. And then in pound sterling, betas are lower. They tend to be in the 30% to 35% range there. And then you can keep going; Aussie dollars, Canadian dollars and so forth. And we have a balance sheet that is prepared for rate rises across those currencies as well. And then you'll just see betas notch up quarter-over-quarter. I think at the terminal level, there's always some amount of lagging that you do, that's just how it happens. You never get to 100% beta or anything near that, because you have some non-interest bearing and you have some lag deposits, but we'll see. We're comfortable where we are in the 50% range going to 60% and I think it will play out well for the NII and the balance sheet accordingly. Sure. Jim, it's Eric. I'm a little more focused on NII than on NIM. And the reason we've done that is because we've actually changed the shape of our balance sheet over time. Remember we added some deposit initiatives which tend to be at lower NIMs, but they are NII accretive and positive. And we do that because sometimes we want to balance currencies around the balance sheet, we want to raise deposits where we want to land. We need to keep deposits for intraday. There lots of reasons why we have different mix of balancing, and we've done that purposely and in an engaging way with our clients over the last two, three years. So I don't think -- as a result, the balance sheet is bigger. And part of the reason we've allowed it to be bigger is that the leverage ratio is not particularly constraining on us. And so what our intentionality is, is actually to maximize NII as opposed to NIM. So I think as you play that out, I think our NIMs are lower at this point than they were last time in the cycle, and I think they'll likely be below the -- the NIMs will be below the highs of the last cycle. On the other hand, I think if you calculate the forecast we've given you for NII for fourth quarter, so the next quarter that we're about to print, that will be a new high of NII relative to what we had seen in the last cycle. And that's where we're a little more focused, because that's what comes back to shareholders and what creates earnings and earnings momentum that contributes to the bottom line. Our guidance has been pretty consistent on this. And I think you'll find it in our 10-Qs and Ks that we estimate that the revenue outflow is about 2 percentage points of fees. So that hasn't changed. You saw some of that begin to come out this quarter that was worth about 5 million this quarter. If you kind of get to the full quarter amount, it'll be just under 10 million for fourth quarter. And that was worth about $1 trillion of AUC/A. So that did occur, and we'll continue to keep you updated on that. But as we previously disclosed and talked about, deconversions just take time and it will play out sometime towards the second half of 2023 and then into 2024 will probably be the majority of it, but we'll just see. We're working closely with BlackRock. We continue to be quite pleased with all the existing business we do with them and the work we do for them in the alternative servicing area, which we're one of the largest providers and certainly help them as they want to evolve, diversify and support their other plants. Gerard, let me start that and it is an area that we continue to work on. The pricing headwinds are just a condition of our industry. Why? Because as you remember, pricing is AUM or AUC/A based. And so as equity markets go up, clients expect some of that to come back to them. The pricing headwinds on an aggregate basis in the servicing fee line are about 2 percentage points of headwinds a year. And when we saw that bubble in 2017, '18, '19, that's come back down. That ticked up and then it's been well managed back down to that 2% or so level. And that's what we are seeing today. We're not seeing anything different than that. And it's well within our expectations. In terms of wins, we always want to focus on net new business and for net new business to drive a positive impact on the revenues as they did this quarter. I was clear in my prepared remarks that that net new business was positive. We had some nice wins. We actually had some nice wins and nice fee rates, right, because both matter to your point. The benchmark I've put out there is that we expect about 1.5 trillion of AUC/A wins a year to be in a good positive direction and trajectory for net new business. But to be honest, as the CFO, I always like to see a little more and you've seen last year was particularly strong. This year, year-to-date, I think we're already comfortably at that level, and we still have another quarter to go. So the sales momentum continues. And what I find important is it continues to close both our traditional customer accounting business and our Alpha offerings, and so it's been broad based. Yes, it's a bit of a mix across different segments and across geographies, but a good rule of thumb is 50%, 55% are assets under custody base, so move up and down with market. There's another 20% of the pricing tends to be based on transactional activity and we actually saw transactions, volumes, DTCC trades, wire transfers, derivatives, transactions, so forth come down this quarter. And then the last 20%, 25% tend to be relatively fixed or sometimes semi fixed, the number of funds you custody for or some flat fees. Yes, we're obviously monitoring the business performance closely; monthly, quarterly. And I think it's -- you should expect -- you can go back to some of the materials that we had shared a year ago, September, as the base case, but you could take that Mike and extrapolate some of what you've seen in our book of business, right. We're an asset management oriented custodian. You can even look at some of our peers as benchmark. And I think you'd find what we've seen, which is that there's a sharp boost in NII in their book or NII plus fees, because of the mix of programs that they run for their clients cash, partially offset I'd say with some downdraft in servicing fee rates, equity and bond markets. And then you'd see a bit of an uptick on the FX services kind of business. So I think it's ours and other large custodians are parallel to what you've seen. And so it's something worth considering. But as we talked about earlier, we're conscious that we need to think about this from a couple different perspectives, but it's performing in line with what we and you would expect at this point. Yes, it is part of our capital forecasting now. And it was actually included in some of the buyback and capital return estimates that we provided not only for the fourth quarter, but also for our intentions related to next year. I think this quarter the accretion was worth $60 million or so of capital and that's just the reversal of that mark accreting back as the bonds mature. There tends to be a little lumpiness to it, but that's the start of the accretion. And so it did provide some amount of modest tailwind and we'll certainly factor that in, right, because just like earnings create an opportunity to return capital to shareholders, the accretion does as well. And that'll be part of that builder capital ratios, which then we can share back with shareholders. Betsy, it's Eric. No, those are incurred charges that are about primarily our staffing and then some of the service providers. But we've also -- what we have done is avoided some of the -- obviously there are costs that are continued on deal closing, some of the advisory fees, et cetera, those have not played through there and those would not be incurred. So those are kind of the base level expenses. There's no tail on those by and large. Since earlier this year, they primarily have been around the BBH transaction work. Yes. Betsy, it's Eric. What I'd describe to you is that the dollar has an effect as do all of the currencies on our P&L and balance sheet. But it's relatively symmetric and thus I'll say almost neutral. And I say that in EBIT terms and in balance sheet terms. Dollar strengthening reduces revenues, but also reduces expenses, not in all currencies and all the time, but it tends to have almost an EBIT neutral impact on the P&L. And then on the balance sheet, you also have a similar effect where as deposits are revalued downwards and foreign jurisdictions as U.S. appreciates, so are the assets in those jurisdictions. And so you have some symmetry. So by and large, it's I'll call it roughly neutral, which is why we don't do any particular hedging on it, because we find that we can manage through it in a comfortable manner. Except that it makes our reporting to all of you in the investment community a little more complicated, but that's just what needs to happen. Vivek, it's Eric. Kind of the outlines, the perimeter of the deal with Brown Brothers hasn't really changed. It's around their investment services business. That's the business that we're attracted to. And that's the one that they'd like to transact. So there's not been any real change there."

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now let me turn it over to Ron.\nRon O’Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good afternoon, everyone. This morning, we released our second quarter financial results. The second quarter operating environment continued to be impacted by the ongoing geopolitical events in Europe and the notable macroeconomic environment. The associated price and wage inflation, rising interest rates, years of recession are driving declining equity in fixed income markets, currency volatility and concerns over market liquidity. These factors created a number of fee revenue headwinds for our businesses. Despite the adverse market conditions, State Street performed well in the second quarter with a strong balance sheet and good sales momentum while delivering strong FX trading and significantly better NII growth year-over-year, coupled with well-controlled expenses and a healthy pretax margin. We remain focused on executing against our strategy and intensely managing what we can control to navigate through uncertainty, drive further business momentum and achieve our medium-term goals. Turning to Slide 3 of our presentation, I will review our second quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Starting with our financial performance. 2Q ‘22 EPS decreased 8% year-over-year, though it was down just 2% year-over-year, excluding notable items, primarily a prior year gain on sale in 2Q ‘21. Weaker markets were the major driver of this decline. Total fee revenue for the quarter declined 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees and the stronger U.S. dollar. Within total fee revenue, our Global Markets franchise continued to perform well with FX trading services revenue increasing market volatility, which drove higher spreads. Total revenue for the quarter declined 3% year-over-year, but was down just 1%, excluding notable items as lower total fee revenue was largely offset by a strong NII result which increased 25% relative to the year ago period. In the face of market-related fee revenue headwinds in the second quarter, we remain highly focused on controlling the expense base. Second quarter total expenses were flat year-over-year and declined 1% excluding notable items. Our ongoing productivity actions largely offset higher-than-anticipated salary increases and planned business investments. Turning to our business momentum, which you can see across the middle of the slide. We reported a strong quarter of new AUC/A asset servicing wins, which amounted to $972 billion with back office services accounting for 40% of these wins by AUC/A. As a result of this quarter’s good sales performance, AUC/A won but yet to be installed increased to a record $3.6 trillion at quarter end. During the second quarter, we also reported another Alpha client win, with 12 of State Street’s 20 Alpha clients now live as of quarter end. We were also awarded the title of Security Services Provider of the Year in the Financial News 20th Annual Trading and Technology Awards. Front office software and data also experienced good business momentum in the second quarter, with annual recurring revenue increasing 20% year-over-year to $251 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.5 trillion at quarter end. Overall second quarter AUM inflows were negatively impacted by the weaker equity market environment but we still saw positive net inflows into both our cash and U.S. low-cost ETF franchises during the quarter. Even in a volatile environment, we continue to innovate and expand our capabilities to drive future growth. For example, Global Advisors continues to press forward in active ETFs and ESG as illustrated by the launch of the actively managed SPDR Nuveen Municipal Bond ESG ETF and a number of MSCI Climate Paris Aligned ETFs. Last, in terms of business momentum, I was particularly pleased to see that State Street was recognized as the top provider in FX services by Euromoney Magazine in the second quarter. Importantly, State Street regained its 1 position overall for real money clients in addition to being ranked 1 for best service for real money clients. Our FX franchise supports and complements our core investment services business and has proven to be an effective deployment of our capital. Turning to our balance sheet and capital. Despite a continued rise in interest rates, our CET1 capital ratio improved significantly to 12.9% at quarter end due to our active management of risk-weighted assets and the mitigating actions we executed in our investment portfolio in the second quarter. The strength of our balance sheet was highlighted in the second quarter with the release of the Federal Reserve’s annual CCAR stress test results in June, following which we announced our intention to increase State Street’s quarterly common stock dividend by 10% to $0.63 per share in the third quarter, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We were pleased to announce the intended increase to our quarterly common dividend as we recognize the importance of capital return to our shareholders. With that in mind, in the fourth quarter of this year, it remains our intention to resume our existing common share repurchase program in an amount reflecting interest rate levels and market conditions at that time. I’ll now turn to our proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services business which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. We continue to be excited about the business and its people, the franchise it represents and the opportunities the transaction represents for our collective clients, and for accelerating our strategy. I’ve mentioned previously that we’ve been engaged in ongoing dialog with U.S. banking regulators regarding the regulatory review process and potential modifications to the transaction intended to facilitate resolution of that process. Based on those discussions, we have developed with BBH, proposed modifications to the transaction structure that the parties believe present a path forward. The proposed modifications include changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and changes to the regulatory approvals required to complete the transaction. As part of the proposed modified transaction, State Street is seeking amendments to the transaction terms, including the purchase price. Both BBH and our Board of Directors would need to review and approve the modified transaction in amended terms. During the third quarter, we intend to finalize the proposed structure and contractual terms and confirm our approach with regulators. Assuming the financial and operational aspects of the proposed modifications are timely finalized and contracted, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions, the parties are aiming to close the transaction at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. However, there exists significant timing uncertainty and risk that closing will extend beyond that time line. There can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will be entered into or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for this modified transaction. After September 6, 2022, either party can terminate the transaction without penalty, absent further agreement of the parties. To conclude, as we progress towards our medium-term targets in this uncertain environment, we remain particularly focused on maintaining and further improving our pretax margin performance, which despite the challenging market conditions, increased almost 29% for the quarter, excluding notable items. To help achieve this goal, in the face of inflationary pressure and a challenging revenue environment, we will continue to exhibit expense discipline and to drive our automation and productivity efforts. We also remain laser-focused on innovating for the benefit of our clients and driving organic growth, as demonstrated by the strong AUC/A wins in the second quarter, all while returning capital to our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll begin my review of our second quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.91 or $1.94 excluding acquisition and restructuring costs as detailed on the panel on the right side of the slide. As Ron noted earlier, the operating environment in the second quarter remained challenging, largely characterized by continued market volatility related to macroeconomic events and continued geopolitical uncertainties. As you can see on the left panel of the slide, strong growth in both net interest income and FX trading enabled us to partially offset significant headwinds from lower equity and fixed income markets in the quarter that impacted other fee areas. Also evidenced by today’s results, our approach to expense management remains very disciplined and deliberate. On a year-on-year basis, second quarter expenses were down even as we experienced higher-than-expected wage increases and continue to thoughtfully invest in the franchise. Lastly, you’ll see that in the second quarter, we had a lower-than-expected tax rate. The bulk of the discrete tax items that contributed to our lower taxes were due to the reassessment of a deferred tax asset worth roughly $60 million. All things considered during the quarter, our business model demonstrated resilience against the challenging backdrop. Turning to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw period-end AUC/A decrease by 10% on a year-on-year basis and 8% sequentially. Amidst continued and uncertain economic conditions, the year-on-year change was largely driven by lower period end market levels across just about every equity and fixed income market around the world, partially offset by net new business and client flows. The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely a result of the same lower period end market levels, as we’ve also started to see industry outflows from investment products as the risk off sentiment continues. Similarly, at Global Advisors, quarter-end AUM decreased 11% year-on-year and 14%, sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was also largely driven by lower period end market levels and institutional net outflows which was partially offset by positive net inflows in both our U.S. low-cost ETF complex and cash inflows in the quarter. Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you’ll see second quarter total servicing fees down 7% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels, normal pricing headwinds, client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business growth. Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down only 4% year-on-year. I’d also highlight that from a segment perspective, we continue to see excellent revenue growth in our alternative client segment, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 5%, primarily as a result of the same drivers, lower average equity and fixed income market levels, client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by positive net new business. Within servicing fees, back office fees were down 7% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the factors I just described. Middle Office Services was down 12% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to decreased client AUMs, driven by lower market levels and client transaction activity and adjustments. But we are seeing some compression in our legacy middle office book. It is an important component of our Alpha proposition when it connects to both the Front office and Back office and new wins generally come with contracts of 7 to 10 years. We continue to expect to see good growth over the medium term as evidenced by our large uninstalled middle office revenue backlog of more than $90 million, which I will talk more about in a moment. Even against this challenging backdrop, we continue to be pleased with our Investment Services business momentum and robust pipeline. We recorded another strong quarter of new AUC/A wins worth $972 billion while AUC/A won, but yet to be installed amounted to $3.6 trillion at quarter end. As Ron mentioned earlier, during second quarter, we reported another new Alpha win, Allspring Global Investments taking the total number of Alpha clients to 20 and now have 12 implementations live. Lastly, in response to industry inflationary cost pressures, we’ve undergone a comprehensive analysis of our pricing across all our product areas. The result of this analysis has led to the decision to begin to adjust our client pricing upwards in certain areas of servicing where the wage pressure is most acute and industry capacity is stretched. Ultimately, we believe these pricing changes will support the continued investment that allows us to best serve our clients. Turning to Slide 7. Second quarter management fees were $490 million, down 3% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels, the impact of currency translation and a specific client repricing adjustment, partially offset by the elimination of money market fee waivers and the run rate impact of net ETF inflows. Management fees were down 6% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds, partially offset by the elimination of the same money market fee waivers. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our franchise remains well positioned for growth. In ETFs, although we saw outflows in equity and commodities, we continue to see inflows into SPDR low cost and fixed income ETFs. In our Institutional Business, there’s continued momentum in our target date franchise, notwithstanding outflows primarily from 1 large client with very low fee assets, which ultimately benefited the overall management fee rate this quarter. Across our cash franchise, we again saw another quarter of strong net inflows, this time worth $15 billion in the quarter, contributing to market share gains. On Slide 8, FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to a period a year ago, second quarter FX trading services revenue was up 16%, primarily driven by higher FX spreads, partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, FX trading services revenue was down 8% as the benefit of higher FX spreads was more than offset by lower client FX volumes too. Our second quarter securities finance revenues decreased slightly year-on-year, primarily driven by lower agency and enhanced custody balances due to lower markets, partially offset by higher spreads. Sequentially, revenues were up 11%, mainly reflecting higher spreads, partially offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances. Second quarter software and processing fees were down 11% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by lower Front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which I’ll turn to shortly. Finally, other fee revenues of negative $43 million in the second quarter declined both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter declines largely reflect negative market-related adjustments while the absence of prior period positive fair value adjustments on equity investments also contributed to the sequential decline. While we saw pressure throughout the quarter, almost half of the $43 million came through in the second half of June. Moving to Slide 9. Let me provide some details on the performance of our Front office software and data revenue in the second quarter on the left panel of this slide. As a reminder, CRD represents the majority of these revenues, but we also include Alpha Data Services, Alpha Data Platform and Mercatus revenues since they are part of our Front office offering. On both a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis, Front office software revenue declined as expected, primarily driven by the absence of several on-premise renewals in the prior periods as well as some episodic fees when compared to the prior year quarter, partially offset by higher software-enabled SaaS revenue. It is important to note, however, that the more durable and recurring software-enabled and professional services revenues have continued to grow nicely with a year-on-year growth of 15%, demonstrating success in deploying our cloud-based SaaS platform environment to more clients. Turning to some of the softer metrics enabled by CRD and Alpha on the right panel, you’ll see that our annual recurring revenue has grown 20% year-on-year as we convert more clients to SaaS, which we expect will create a stickier and more profitable business model. As for the middle office, we continue to have an extremely healthy backlog of uninstalled revenue worth $92 million, which is almost twice the prior year. Lastly, we are pleased to have announced another Alpha mandate win this quarter. We’re also excited to have expanded an existing Alpha relationship this quarter, winning approximately $300 billion of new back office assets to custody from an asset owner client. This provides another proof point that our Alpha value proposition is working as we’re gaining more of the wallet share over time. Turning to Slide 10. Second quarter NII increased 25% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and continued growth in loan balances. Relative to the first quarter, NII was up 15%. The sequential increase was largely driven by the improvement in both short and long end rates, which benefited our yields, together with continued growth in loan balances, partially offset by lower investment portfolio balances. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the quarter. Average deposits were down 6% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter, primarily related to the impact from currency translation and dollar strengthening, which accounted for almost half of the year-on-year decline and 2/3 of the sequential decline. The investment portfolio is now down modestly, and we have almost 60% of our securities now in held to maturity. We’re pleased that our balance sheet is well positioned to recognize this interest rate and NII tailwinds and also protect OCI. Turning to Slide 11. Second quarter expenses, excluding notable items, decreased 1% year-on-year or increased 2% adjusted for currency translation. In response to the revenue environment, we have been proactively managing our expenses, including lowering our incentive compensation, in addition to carefully executing on our continued productivity savings efforts which generated approximately $60 million in year-on-year gross saves or approximately $150 million year-to-date. These savings enabled us to continue to self-fund the good portion of the 4% to 6% higher wage rates we’re facing and the targeted investments in the business, including the Alpha product, technology infrastructure and broader automation. Compared to 2Q ‘21, compensation employee benefits was down 3% as lower incentive compensation, the impact of currency translation were partially offset by salary merit increases associated with wages and inflationary pressure and higher contractor spend. Excluding currency translation, compensation and employee benefits would have been up 1%. Information systems and communications expenses was down 2%, primarily due to the episodic credits related to vendor pricing optimization and infrastructure rationalization. Occupancy was down 4% due largely to currency translation. And other expenses were up 18%, primarily reflecting higher recoverable client-related expenses, which are offset in fee revenue, professional fees and travel costs. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, expenses were down due to seasonal expenses in the first quarter. Headcount increased quarter-on-quarter as we continue to in-source some strategic technology functions from vendors as well as support growth in Alpha. Overall, in light of the current macroeconomic environment, we have had pretty healthy pretax margin for the quarter at approximately 29%, excluding notable items, supported by active expense management and strong NII growth. Moving to Slide 12. On the right side of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are quite pleased to report CET1 of 12.9%, up 100 basis points happy with our performance under this year’s CCAR with a calculated stress capital buffer well above the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a preliminary SCB at the floor. As a result, in June, we announced the planned 10% increase to our 3Q ‘22 quarterly common stock dividend, subject to Board approval, and it remains our intention to again begin our existing common share repurchase program in the fourth quarter in an amount reflecting market conditions at the time. To the left of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see this quarter, even against the backdrop of a challenging operating environment, we drove stronger and higher capital levels. During the second quarter, we completed several of the previously announced RWA optimization actions across our trading, lending and investment portfolios, reducing RWA $12 billion quarter-on-quarter. We also shifted about $20 billion of AFS securities to HTM. As a result, we limited AOCI from the investment portfolio to under $500 million or 40 basis points of CET1, even with a roughly 60 basis point upward interest rate move across the 2- and 5-year part of the curve. You’ll see a larger AOCI move in the GAAP books, but much of that is ratio hedged and offset by the appreciating dollar effect on RWA with an offsetting goodwill and intangibles as well. Given that we have now significantly reduced the OCI risk to interest rate shocks by 75%, we are now comfortable operating somewhat below our standard target ranges for both CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. Turning to Slide 13. We provide a summary of our second quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I am pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates the strength of our business model. The current macroeconomic environment and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, notwithstanding, our strong growth in both net interest income and FX trading services enabled us to partially offset significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets highlighting the resiliency of our franchise. And our expenses remained well controlled, demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model. Now turning to outlook. We would like to provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter. At a macro level, while market rate expectations have been volatile, our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forward which suggests the year-end Fed funds rate of 3.5%. We expect other major international central banks to continue raising rates, with the ECB expected to start increasing rates in third quarter. The current spot level of global equity markets would imply that average equity markets in 3Q would be down 7% to 8% quarter-on-quarter, and U.S. dollar appreciation to be about 1 percentage point of headwind to revenues and tailwind to expenses, which will be included in our guide. Now in terms of the third quarter of 2022 and on a standalone State Street basis. Given the implied declines in average Global Markets, we expect total fee revenue to be down about 2% on a sequential basis. And we expect both servicing fees and management fees to be down 4% quarter-on-quarter, driven by weaker market levels. Turning to NII. Following 1 of the strongest sequential increases in the NII for many years in 2Q, we expect to deliver further growth with NII expected to increase 5% to 9% quarter-on-quarter, driven by the tailwind from Central Bank rate hikes. This outlook includes our expectation for some initial deposit outflow and rotation in 3Q. And for the full year, on a stand-alone State Street basis, we expect NII to increase 24% to 27%, which is significantly better than our prior full year guide of 18% to 20%. Next, we expect total expenses, excluding notable items, to increase just under 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by inflationary pressures on wages as we continue to target productivity initiatives and execute against our strategy with a deep focus on expense discipline. This focus enable us to drive positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items for the full year. Lastly, we would expect our 3Q tax rate to be approximately 20% for the quarter. And with that, let me turn the call back to Ron.\nRon O’Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr : Thanks very much. In your prepared remarks, you talked about 2Q management fees driven by markets, other step up, also a client-specific pricing adjustment. I just wondered if you could just give us a little more color on that. So we don’t know if it’s a one-off or could be other adjustments going forward?\nEric Aboaf : Sorry, Glenn, and sorry you’re breaking up on the audio. Could you -- I got bits of that, but could you repeat that, please, for the...?\nGlenn Schorr : Absolutely. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned 2Q management fees driven by markets, which is obviously going to happen. But you also said client-specific pricing adjustment. I wonder if you could give a little more detail, say, the size and what kind of adjustment that was just in case we should be thinking about that going forward?\nEric Aboaf : Sure, Glenn. Let me try to cover that. And I think you’re focused on servicing fees and management fees. So let me do them both so that we have a little bit of context for you. On Page 6 of the materials on servicing fees, about the impact of client activity and adjustments. And on a year-on-year basis, largely due to the kind of lower levels of activities and sometimes that comes through with lower markets, that was worth about 1 percentage point of headwind on a year-on-year basis and about 2 points on a quarter-on-quarter basis for that. On management fees, there was a series of impacts quarter-on-quarter. Most of that was driven by market. There was 1 client that we called out but that would have been worth at most 1 to 2 percentage points of fees for that quarter.\nGlenn Schorr : Okay. And then I have just -- I know this would be included in your guidance but I’m looking for a little color. When markets -- I remember when they used to go up all the time, you keep temporary enthusiasm on fee rates -- on fees in general, servicing fees because some contracts have ceilings in them. My question is, if and when we continue any downtrend in these markets, do those same contracts have floors? Should we expect more stable servicing fees if and when the markets continue to drag lower?\nRon O’Hanley : Glenn, I’ll take that. You’re accurate. We have a small number. They tend to be very large clients where you just do hit the top of the fee schedule or even in some cases, the fees continued to tail down. I don’t think we’re close to that yet in terms of that being meaningful. So I wouldn’t expect to see that being a factor in the near term unless we see a much more significant kind of market downturn.\nGlenn Schorr : Okay. Thank you.\nRon O’Hanley : Operator, the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.\nKen Usdin : Ron, just following up on your opening remarks and what we saw on the forward-looking statements. Just as you go forward and try to negotiate, I guess, just -- how do you think through your optionality, meaning that, of course, a price concession is probably your best outcome. If you can’t get one, is that a go-not-go decision right there? And then if for some reason, you do walk away one side or the other, what becomes your next immediate steps in terms of either capital strategy or a go-forward strategy? Thanks.\nRon O’Hanley : Yes, Ken, we’re very much in the midst of this. So I don’t want to get out ahead of it. Firstly, we remain committed to the combination on a strategic basis. But given that we foresee this being restructured in a way that it changes some of the operating model, some of the circumstances change. We do believe -- well, we know we believe some kind of a price adjustment would be warranted. I don’t want to get ahead of where we are in discussions with PBH. They remain very amicable and both sides are committed to making this happen. We’re committed to -- we like the business. We like the get there, then there’s a lot of options, and we come back to you at that time.\nKen Usdin : Okay. That’s fair. And then secondly, Eric, on your NII update, the new guy. Just wondering how much of that update is a new curve? And if you can help us understand where you are on that? And what are you getting on new securities yields now versus what’s rolling off the back book?\nEric Aboaf : Yes, Ken, the uptick in the NII guide, I think probably both for the third quarter and then the full year, which we’ve updated is primarily driven by the higher yield curve and expectations in the U.S. plus some expectation that the ECB is going to start to seriously raise rates in the third quarter. And we’ve said that once the ECB crosses 25 basis point positive rate threshold, that begins to be accretive. So I think those are the major drivers. On investment portfolio yields, I think you see that in our average balance sheet. They are up on average, almost 15 basis points quarter-on-quarter. And you will expect that, that kind of increase will continue to flow through the books. To the question of exactly what a new security comes in at versus an old security rolls out at, I think the best way to estimate that because it will vary by different parts of the book, whether it’s the treasuries, whether it’s the MBS, whether it’s the foreign securities is we’re basically replenishing securities that have an average duration of 2.8 years. So you can kind of see what an older security with that vintage would look like and compare it to what’s in the market today. And you’ll see a nice pickup, and that’s what’s flowing through and giving us the kind of quarter-on-quarter increase on average that you saw this quarter. And we’ll expect to see another increase on average in that order of magnitude in the third quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck : A couple of questions. First, just on the discussion around the forward look. I wanted to make sure I understood what types of things are being looked to change? Is this a function of you need to keep more data servicing processing within certain countries to satisfy regulatory requirements? Or is there something else that’s more not operational but more around what parts of the business you can do? I’m wondering if it’s an expense issue or if it’s a revenue opportunity issue.\nEric Aboaf : Betsy, it’s Eric. Those are all the kinds of areas we’re working through. And I think the heart of this when you do a banking deal, a global banking deal, this sort is the legal entity structure. And you obviously know we run a holding company, a bank, a series of banks and there’s a series of entities that we have around the world. And obviously, creating a workable and a good path of combination can be done in different ways. And part of what we’ve been working through is modifications on what might have been our original plan to make the transaction workable and attractive. That then has some ramifications to your point on the operating model that will have some amount of effect on perhaps the pace of expense -- or pace of expense or revenue synergies, and that’s what we’re working through. What we have said, and we’d want to reiterate is that we are committed to finding a way to preserve the economic accretion that in the range that we had previously disclosed back in September. And so we’re highly focused on that. And as a result, there are some changes that we’re seeking on the transaction that including price that Ron mentioned.\nBetsy Graseck : Okay. And then you get this in front of regulators but if they don’t agree by September 6, you’ve indicated you want to close by the end of the year. How should investors think about what you’re expected thought process is going to be between that time period September 6 to 31?\nRon O’Hanley : Yes. Betsy, it’s Ron. I mean the September 6 date, it’s basically the 1-year anniversary for the deal. And like a lot of transactions, they have an outside limit. So the way you should interpret that is what we’ve said is both parties remain committed. We’ve got to work through things. I mean the regulatory world and the political world has changed significantly since we announced this deal and what we’re looking towards as a way to breakthrough and close it in a reasonable time period, and this time period doesn’t seem reasonable to anybody, but it’s actually better than some of the alternatives that we’ve been faced with. So if you think about the September 6, it’s an existing date. And assuming everything is going along fine and parties are agreeing, then we just agree to an extension of that to the close date.\nBetsy Graseck : Got it.\nRon O’Hanley : Just disclosing and reminding everybody what the terms of the transaction are.\nBetsy Graseck : Okay. No, that’s helpful. And then just last for me, is I think you mentioned that given the restructuring of the balance sheet that you’ve made and the success with that, that you’re now comfortable with running potentially below management targets for CET1 SLR. Could you remind us what the targets are and how much below you’re willing to dip?\nEric Aboaf : Sure, Betsy, it’s Eric. I think the best place to see our capital ratios and targets is on Page 12 of the presentation deck. You see our -- what I’ll call our standard CET1 targets, our 10% to 11% are standard leverage -- Tier 1 leverage targets of 5.25% to 5.75%. And what we’ve done, as you mentioned, is we’ve dramatically reduced the volatility risk from OCI which means that we’re quite comfortable running below that. Directionally, that means on CET1, for example, could be up to 50 basis points below that. While we run at much lower risk and volatility levels in OCI and on a leverage basis, it tends to be about half of the -- of that amount.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken : So Eric, you referenced that you were considering some adjustments to the pricing model which make a lot of sense. Obviously, we’re dealing with a very inflationary environment. Have you begun those discussions? And what has been the reaction from clients so far? Are you hearing from some of your clients that some of the competitors are also making similar moves just to be assured that you’re not going to be out on your own pushing in that regard because it’s normally when we think of pricing, of course, in the custody world, we typically -- it’s typically a tougher place to get price increases. So kind of curious about that.\nRon O’Hanley : Brennan, it’s Ron. Why don’t I start on this and Eric will fill in. We’re early in this process, but yes, we have been out with clients and walk through our planned price increases with a few clients at this point. And there’s a whole plan as Eric alluded. It’s around the areas where we’ve got the most inflationary pressure which might be specialty areas, areas where there’s limited capacity in the marketplace, areas that are just growing very rapidly. And interestingly, the earliest ones have been in some ways, I think clients were not surprised that it was coming at them. So I’m not saying that’s the way it’s going to be. None of us enjoy paying more for something today than what we paid yesterday. But we’re going at this in a very fact-based way. These tend to be sophisticated institutional buyers, and they know what’s going on. So I can’t speak for what others are doing. I just don’t have a feel for that. But we’re running our business in the way we believe we need to. And we think this is an important component of it.\nBrennan Hawken : Okay. Thank you for that. And then when we think about the -- you laid out, Eric, the expectation around ECB and whatnot. But as we see potential policy rates in different parts of the world diverging. Could you give us a reminder about the currency mix of your deposit -- of your deposits as it stands now? And whether or not you expect in the next -- in the foreseeable future, that to shift at all as yield differentials widen between different currencies? Thank you.\nEric Aboaf : Sure, Brennan, it’s Eric. And we actually added some additional disclosure in our addendum, our financial addendum this quarter. You’ll find it on Page 8. That actually breaks out the balance sheet, including the total assets, the investment securities and deposits by the major currencies, USD, euros, pound sterling and so forth because we are quite focused on navigating this interest rate environment. To be honest, securing the benefits of interest rate increases around the world, right? We position the balance sheet currency by currency. We have pricing plans and betas that are carefully developed currency by currency. I don’t think we expect a lot of change in the composition of the balance sheet. I mean, the U.S. is clearly -- the U.S. Central Bank is clearly moving much more quickly, and with not only interest rates, but quantitative tightening. And that will potentially have a downward trend on U.S. currency deposits. On the other hand, with U.S. rates prevailing rates higher than what you see around the rest of the world, there’s a natural draw into the U.S. from global investors. So it’s hard to -- I think it’s hard to actually forecast the currency composition and the deposit levels given those movements. But we’re well prepared. And in fact, some of the interest rate or some of the NII increases that you saw this quarter are coming not only by virtue of the U.S. rate rises, but also those in pound sterling and some of the other Anglo-Saxon currencies. And we’re positioning currency by currency as a result.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global.\nJames Mitchell : Eric, maybe just on the securities portfolio. You had a pretty big shift into HTM to derisk the AOCI. But I’m just looking it does have a materially higher yield. Is there something to think about in the HTM portfolio that you’ve kind of locked in longer duration or it’s a little more credit risk in there. How do I think about the HTM portfolio versus AFS and how that can evolve? Does it hold back NII sensitivity or not?\nEric Aboaf : Jim, it’s Eric. We’re quite careful about managing our NII sensitivity holistically across the book. I think what you’ll see is that because we use HTM to protect against interest rate and AOCI volatility, it’s more natural that if we have a blended book of short-, medium- and longer-term securities that we would move more of the medium and longer-term securities into HTM because thereby, we get the most protection while we give up the least amount of sale optionality. So that’s why you’re just seeing a higher yield. I think you’ll see that generally be true, and you can follow that in our disclosures accordingly.\nJames Mitchell : Okay. Great. And then when I think about the yet to be installed business, I mean it continues to grow. I know there’s a long tail to getting those installed. But are we at a point where this -- mean I think we’ve looked in the past, and I think we all get a little frustrated that we see these big wins, and it’s hard to determine or see it in the numbers. Are we at a point where this is getting to materiality and that we could see a nice acceleration inorganic growth next year when this stuff gets installed?\nEric Aboaf : Yes. I think you’ve got the right broad time frame. I mean the -- I guess the way I would describe it is the larger the deal, the more complex and more transformative it is for our clients, right? That’s the -- they’re fundamentally changing their operating model, they’re harmonizing systems and processes, and we’re co-investing with them to build for them a front, middle and often back-office model that will suit them for a decade or more. As you think about the $3.6 trillion of AUC/A to be installed, 2023 is an important year. We expect that about 1/3. This will move around, but about 1/3 will likely be installed by the end of that year and perhaps as much as half of the revenue associated with those wins.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell : Eric, if you could just repeat that comment on the 1/3 of the $3.6 trillion. Was that by the end of next year did you say? I just missed that.\nEric Aboaf : Yes, that’s correct. By the end of 2023.\nBrian Bedell : Got it. Just back to the BBH strategy. So good to hear that you’re both committed to this. If it -- if you are able to close it with any amended terms and amended structures, can you just remind us or I guess if you have comments on the deposit strategy, which was obviously bringing the BBH deposits on balance sheet? And then there was an opportunity to bring potentially a large portion of balances over out of -- from their $60 billion of off balance sheet or third-party bank, I should say, arrangements. Is that -- would that still be doable? Or does the structure change that calculus?\nEric Aboaf : Brian, it’s -- we’re still in the process of nailing down both the legal entity and the operating model changes, and we’re working through those and working towards developing a firm view of when and how the deposit and sweep program is operated, and how we may in the future, use that program, take advantage of some of the cash and deposit optionality. But that’s in process at this point. And we’ll certainly provide an update in the course of the third quarter I expect as we nail down the modifications.\nBrian Bedell : Yes. That makes sense. And then maybe just excluding BBH and just looking at everything on a State Street-only basis, should we be thinking do you think in this cycle, we should be thinking of deposit runoff to be sort of similar to the last cycle? I think we were down more than 15% in average deposit levels from start of Fed hiking to the trough in 2019. Is that a reasonable starting point to think about that deposit runoff? Or is something different in the cycle that would make you think that you wouldn’t have that?\nEric Aboaf : I think the last cycle is always going to be indicative, but you remember, there were moving parts in the last cycle, including the SLR rule was in flux and there was -- we -- many of us on the banking side had to navigate the size of our balance sheet independently what was happening at the interest rate environment and quantitative tightening. I think what I’ve said in the past is relevant over the -- since the kind of the pre-COVID time period, our deposits are up roughly $60 billion. We think that half of that can easily be ascribed to the quantitative easing that we had, and that will reverse out. Now that’s estimated. It’s always hard to forecast this because the interest rate environment is moving up quickly. There is also risk off environment. So we’ve got to see how that plays out. I’ve said that we could see $6 billion to $10 billion of outflows per year per $1 trillion of U.S. balance sheet tightening. I do think because the interest rate environment is higher and has moved faster, right, we’re likely to see closer to the $10 billion per $1 trillion in the first year and then maybe lighten out in the second and third year. But those are all the scenarios we’re working through. I think from our perspective, we’re extremely flushed from a liquidity standpoint. The deposits are valuable, so we’re monetizing them for the purpose of the P&L. And we expect over time to be able to only get to the higher levels of NII that we have in the past. I think we were in the $695 million range with our peak during the last cycle, I think our forecast -- and it’s hard to forecast this perfectly. But the forecast that we’ve built put us at or above that level in this next cycle. And part of that is that while there is some tightening and erosion of total deposit levels, you also have higher U.S. rates, higher global rates and in particular, we’ll have a move in ECB and European rates, at least based on the current forwards.\nOperator: Sure. Your next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak : So Eric, I wanted to better understand just some of the guidance items that you outlined specific to both fees and expenses. And on the fee side, certainly, the guys that you offer suggest greater resiliency compared with some of the more acute declines that we’ve seen in some of the market proxies. Just want to get a sense as to what’s driving that better outcome? And specific to expenses, I was hoping you can give some bookends in terms of what range of expense growth we should be contemplating? You cited inflationary pressures multiple times, the need to maybe revisit pricing with some of your clients, but you also have some FX tailwinds. So I was hoping to get some perspective on what sort of expense growth range we should be thinking about for the remainder of this year?\nEric Aboaf : Sure. Let me start on fees. The real environmental challenge is if you just extend out the current spot levels of that equity markets are sitting at, the average -- the daily average for third quarter is going to be down 7% to 8% versus the average for second quarter. And that’s the basis by which we earn revenues both in servicing fees and management fees. So that’s the headwind that we have. We’re hoping that some of the market related -- the lumpy sub that we have in other revenues doesn’t repeat and that might give us a little bit of insulation. So that’s why I said servicing and management fees could be down the 4% range sequentially, but total fees, perhaps closer to 2%, So less so. And obviously, volatility levels in markets help currency trading and other activities. But we’ve got to play out and see how the summer months happen. I think on expenses, I’m just trying to guide quarter-by-quarter. I think if you add up first quarter, second quarter, the guide of just under 1 percentage point for the third quarter. And you can put a range around that and estimate fourth quarter. And so we’re -- I think that’s what we’ve done from a guidance standpoint. I think what we are willing to say is because we have kind of an overall view of fee revenues for third quarter, we can guesstimate into fourth quarter as can you. I think NII, we have quite a solid view of the full year, which we’ve provided. We’re comfortable of saying and we said in our prepared remarks that we expect to drive positive total operating leverage for the year, adjusted for notables. But we feel confident in that given the current market environment. And part of that is we have some visibility, as we’ve described on fees, a good bit of visibility on NII. And to be honest, while there are some wage and inflationary pressures because the P&L is lighter, we’ve proactively adjusted the incentive line to compensate for that. And we’re committed to navigating through this environment in a thoughtful way and deliver results that are as positive and as appropriate as possible.\nSteven Chubak : That’s really helpful color. And just 1 follow-up on the -- some of the expense commentary Eric, you offered. One of the questions we’ve been fielding from a lot of folks pertains to the longer-term expense growth algorithm. You guys have done a really good job of reining in expenses on an absolute basis over the past few years. Clearly, the inflationary pressures are starting to build as we think about your efficiency agenda that you guys have prosecuted on, but at the same time, the inflationary pressure is building simultaneously. How do you see that expense growth algorithm evolving over time?\nEric Aboaf : Yes. And I think we’ll know more over the course of the year, but I think there are some inflationary pressures, some of which we can look for ways to at least limit, but we can’t really avoid. So let me give you an example. On the $8 billion expense base that we have, about $2.5 billion of that is salaries. Now salaries historically have moved up about 2 percentage points a year, maybe 3 but right now, if you look at merit increases, the higher salary replacement rates for new hires versus exits, bidding back selectively talent, salary costs are up closer to 4% to 6% on a run rate basis on a base of $2.5 billion. So you could do the math there and start to get a sense that, that creates an additional headwind that we didn’t have and that headwind could be worth an extra point of expenses on the total $8 billion base. It’s that kind of environment that we’re operating in. I mean we need to see if that persists into next year. Do we have a recession or not, what happens to labor markets. And then the other part of that is working through where we are on non-comp expenses, where vendors come to us sometimes and say, look, we feel the need to adjust, and we’re obviously trying to manage and rein that in. And I think that’s another factor. So I think we see some of those. We’re trying to telegraph them, but we’re also committing to -- committed to achieve and deliver on our medium-term targets. And some of that’s going to be by finding in some ways to maybe limit or contain or offset. But in other ways, they may come through. The interest rate environment will give us a tailwind. And then you heard us describe some of the selective changes that we’re discussing with clients around pricing and top line pricing. So there are a number of different factors. I think I’m not -- it’s early to give a fulsome view of what next year portends. But I would say that we’re conscious, we’re in a elements that we can control and others that aren’t as controllable. But we’re also committed to getting to our medium-term targets. And I think that provides a good set of goals for us and that we’re committed to.\nRon O’Hanley : Yes, Steve, what I would add to that is that throughout this period that we’ve been managing expenses over the last several years as we’ve been quite clear on, we’ve also been investing in the business, particularly around automation and technology. There’s still payoffs expected from that. We’ve seen some. There’s more in the future. So the other bit of this we’ll be continuing to manage that algorithm between how much we continue to spend on automating more to get the future productivity savings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy : Hi, Ron. Hi, Eric. Guys -- maybe Eric, you’ve, in the past, given us an update on the variable rate pricing of your fee revenues. What percentage of fee revenues today would you consider variable pricing, which are greatly influenced by market levels, of course? And second, and Ron, when you talked about -- talking about price increases for some of the products for your customers, is that for both the variable rate type pricing as well as fixed rate pricing?\nEric Aboaf : Yes. Let me -- Gerard, let me start. Our pricing schedules, there’s a lot of history behind them on the servicing fee side. I would say that -- and we disclosed this in our Q with some specificity, but about half of the revenues earned through the servicing fee schedules are market level dependent. So the kind of assets under custody levels. There’s then a portion that is driven by transactional or activity of volumes and then the balance is fixed. So there is a mix. And that’s what you’re seeing flowing through the P&L at this point. They are complex schedules. They -- you can measure them with a ruler in some cases, just because they span the world. They expand products and regions and entities and often have some history associated with them. But that’s a broad basis.\nRon O’Hanley : Yes. And then, Gerard, just the second part of your question, are we going at the asset-based fee, the variable fee or the fixed fee? I mean, it’s a little bit of both. And again, we’re trying to be reasonable firstly, to our clients, but also to ourselves and really tying this to where there’s real inflationary pressures. And also recognizing that we have a commitment to generating really good service for our clients, right? Service better than our competitors. So it’s less about is that the variable or the fixed, it’s where are we having these pressures and therefore, where do we need a price increase.\nGerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a quick follow-up, Eric, in the held-to-maturity portfolio, the duration was 2.8 years, as you pointed out. Can you share with us the OCI accretion back into capital? About how many basis points a year do you think you’ll see in that? And then second, what’s the average yield of that HTM portfolio today? Thank you.\nEric Aboaf : Sure. Let me do that in pieces. Then the HTM portfolio, I think there’s good data for you and others in the financial addendum. And you can find that on Page 9 of our agendum. The -- we described the AFS portfolio both on average and on an end-of-period basis in the HTM portfolio. And I think in total, the yield on AFS right now is about 91 basis points, on the held-to-maturity about 155 basis points. And that’s just because of the duration that we tend to put in held-to-maturity to protect it from OCI. In terms of the accretion that will come through, we expect the accretion to start towards the fourth quarter, in particular, a little bit in the third and then into the fourth quarter. And we’re looking at accretion in the $100 million to $200 million range of capital. It will bounce around quarter-by-quarter as different maturities come through. But that’s a healthy amount of capital accretion, and that could be worth 10, 15 basis points of capital and could certainly help us fund the future buybacks and other returns of capital to shareholders, which, as we’ve said, we’d like to restart in the fourth quarter and continue on from there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Mayo : First, thanks for changing the time of your conference call, given so much else happening today. So on the pricing due to inflation, I mean, it all makes sense. It’s all logical. But can you actually get that done? We’ve talked for the last 3 decades. Now it seems like you have more of a reason to increase pricing than ever before. Ron, you’ve been on the other side of this, you’re getting the phone call. “Hi, this is State Street. We’d like to increase the pricing by 5%.” And then you’re like, “Well, we’re going to go to these other 3 or 4 or 5 providers.” So how much confidence do you have that you can pass on some of these price increases to your customers?\nRon O’Hanley : It’s a good question, Mike. I would say that what’s changed over the years is virtually everybody. You go back 15, 20 years ago, virtually everybody bought the same service. It was custody fund accounting. It was publicly listed markets. It was fairly consistent in playing and it was very easy to do, as you said. I think what’s changed is that even -- certainly, in the medium to large managers, you’re seeing a broad product base, some of which are actually reasonably complicated to do, whether it’s complicated because of the skills required complicated because of the technology that’s required. And it’s in those areas where we’re seeing the highest inflationary pressures. And we think that we offer a superior capability. We think that in many cases, there’s just limited capacity in the marketplace. And we also think that it’s a time where -- that everybody is seeing the same kind of pressure the last 10, 15, 20 years, the world’s been enjoying, in effect, the great deflation. And that’s not what’s going on now. So it’s always dangerous to utter those words. This time is different, so I won’t. But we do think there’s a set of circumstances in a targeted set of areas where pricing adjustments are required. And that we believe that clients will understand. And again, very early reads, but they seem to be.\nMichael Mayo : And as a compromise, are you talking more about compensating deposit balances, like the trust banks had in the past when rates were higher?\nRon O’Hanley : No.\nMichael Mayo : Okay. Just why don’t -- we want to get paid more because our costs are up for us and everybody else. And so 1/3...\nEric Aboaf : Mike, that’s on deposits, remember, we’ve been under-earning on deposits against what cost us to hold deposits, which is preferred securities, right, for -- now several years, we barely offset that at the height of the last interest rate increase in 2017 and ‘18. And so -- we’re just trying to get to par on deposit spreads. And obviously, as deposit rates rise, we give a reasonable proportion of that back to our clients. So we do that purposely. That’s part of the social contract. But that feels like it’s going back to a normalized level, the wage and salary and non-comp pressures that we’re seeing are not different than what others are seeing in the rest of the economy. And that on a net basis is quite different.\nMichael Mayo : Okay. That’s good clarification. Thank you. And then just last on that, your cost is going higher. I thought a lot of banks seem to have an advantage just like you. You had $2 billion of expenses, $1 billion in comp, but comp -- and society is going up less than other inflation, right, like food, rent, gas, everything else is going up a lot more than employee costs. And what we’ve been hearing, at least anecdotally, among the banks is that some of those employee cost pressures have been waning in the most recent months and weeks. But what I hear from you is that that’s not the case? Or even if it is the case, you’re still talking about kind of 2x historical growth than in the past?\nRon O’Hanley : Mike, what I would say is what you say about comp costs lagging behind other inflationary expenses, I mean, that is true, and that’s typical, right? That’s typically how kind of inflation works its way into and through labor markets. I would say that we’ve certainly seen a much higher than trend pressure on us and I would venture since we’re swimming in the same pool of skills here. I would say certainly with our nearing competitors in -- particularly in the skilled areas that we need. And as Eric noted, in some of the -- when we’re replacing somebody that’s come in at a much or a significantly higher cost than before. Now I think it’s also true that if you believe that there’s a recession facing us or that in any event, there will be less kind of economic growth going forward than what we see now for a period of time. That’s likely to take pressure off it, but there’s still a very real move up in select areas around our expenses. And I actually don’t think it would be different for a comparable institution.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack of Autonomous Research.\nRobert Wildhack : Ron, just a quick 1 for me. I wanted to ask about the drop in RWAs in the quarter. Could you talk about what the drivers are there? And what kind of RWA outlook or assumption is embedded in your guidance going forward?\nEric Aboaf : Yes. We -- as you recall, Rob, we had, in the first quarter, consciously deployed more RWA in some of our business activities, in particular in trading and in lending, just because we were -- we had a surplus amount of capital and so we put it to work and had some good revenues. This quarter, we’re writing that back in, partly because we were driving -- we were committed to driving our capital ratios upward. And partly, to be honest, we’ve found some opportunities for optimization. So I talked about more of a -- more than a $10 billion reduction quarter-on-quarter. That came across businesses and securities finance that came in the lending book where some of the loans qualified for margin loan treatment, which comes at a different RWA level. And then we had some amount of credit, I’ll call it, sort of credit-light in the investment portfolio that was 100% risk weighted that we allowed to roll off. So there were some tactical adjustments that we made in that -- on that basis. We also tend to have some volatility in RWA. The FX derivatives book can move around by $3 billion, $4 billion, and that was -- that we got a good balance there. So I think about 1/3, I’d say, was of the $10 billion to $12 billion quarter-on-quarter reduction was a good balance, and we’ll take those. But that could actually that $3 billion to $4 billion could bounce back up in the third quarter, and we’re obviously considering that we continue to accrete through the P&L every quarter. And I think we’re quite comfortable with our capital ratio trajectory into the third quarter and also in such a way that we can prepare for buybacks in the fourth quarter as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nVivek Juneja : Firstly, I want to echo Mike’s comments that about changing the timing of the call, I am glad. I would take that 1 step further and say in the future it will be helpful if you even think of another day, so it will be not on such a crazy day for all of us, so we can actually pay a little more attention to it. But moving past that, the price increases that you’re talking about on the servicing contracts, given that these are longer-duration contracts, Ron, when should we expect that they could start to go through? Is it a year out? Or do you think you could actually go -- these could go into effect in a fairly short order? What kind of timing would you point to?\nRon O’Hanley : Yes. That it’s a good question. And again, because we’re trying to be very fact-based and tie it to where there’s increases and where we feel we need to do this. The answer is it varies. In some cases, it’s around particular transactions or asset class types where we can institute in other cases. There is an agreement that we need to secure from the client but our goal is to -- I mean, obviously, the pressure is now. So we want to put it in as soon as possible. Again, we’re early in this process. So we’ll see what we accomplished in terms of overall timing. But I think given our approach, which, again, is based on facts and the realities of client situations, we’re optimistic that we can accomplish something here.\nOperator: There are no further questions from the phone lines. At this time, I’ll turn the conference back over to Mr. Ron O’Hanley for closing remarks.\nRon O’Hanley: Well, thank you, operator, and thank you all for participating in the call, and thank you for your support.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. We would like to thank you all for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Ron O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good afternoon, everyone. This morning, we released our second quarter financial results. The second quarter operating environment continued to be impacted by the ongoing geopolitical events in Europe and the notable macroeconomic environment. The associated price and wage inflation, rising interest rates, years of recession are driving declining equity in fixed income markets, currency volatility and concerns over market liquidity. These factors created a number of fee revenue headwinds for our businesses. Despite the adverse market conditions, State Street performed well in the second quarter with a strong balance sheet and good sales momentum while delivering strong FX trading and significantly better NII growth year-over-year, coupled with well-controlled expenses and a healthy pretax margin. We remain focused on executing against our strategy and intensely managing what we can control to navigate through uncertainty, drive further business momentum and achieve our medium-term goals. Turning to Slide 3 of our presentation, I will review our second quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Starting with our financial performance. 2Q ‘22 EPS decreased 8% year-over-year, though it was down just 2% year-over-year, excluding notable items, primarily a prior year gain on sale in 2Q ‘21. Weaker markets were the major driver of this decline. Total fee revenue for the quarter declined 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees and the stronger U.S. dollar. Within total fee revenue, our Global Markets franchise continued to perform well with FX trading services revenue increasing market volatility, which drove higher spreads. Total revenue for the quarter declined 3% year-over-year, but was down just 1%, excluding notable items as lower total fee revenue was largely offset by a strong NII result which increased 25% relative to the year ago period. In the face of market-related fee revenue headwinds in the second quarter, we remain highly focused on controlling the expense base. Second quarter total expenses were flat year-over-year and declined 1% excluding notable items. Our ongoing productivity actions largely offset higher-than-anticipated salary increases and planned business investments. Turning to our business momentum, which you can see across the middle of the slide. We reported a strong quarter of new AUC/A asset servicing wins, which amounted to $972 billion with back office services accounting for 40% of these wins by AUC/A. As a result of this quarter's good sales performance, AUC/A won but yet to be installed increased to a record $3.6 trillion at quarter end. During the second quarter, we also reported another Alpha client win, with 12 of State Street's 20 Alpha clients now live as of quarter end. We were also awarded the title of Security Services Provider of the Year in the Financial News 20th Annual Trading and Technology Awards. Front office software and data also experienced good business momentum in the second quarter, with annual recurring revenue increasing 20% year-over-year to $251 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.5 trillion at quarter end. Overall second quarter AUM inflows were negatively impacted by the weaker equity market environment but we still saw positive net inflows into both our cash and U.S. low-cost ETF franchises during the quarter. Even in a volatile environment, we continue to innovate and expand our capabilities to drive future growth. For example, Global Advisors continues to press forward in active ETFs and ESG as illustrated by the launch of the actively managed SPDR Nuveen Municipal Bond ESG ETF and a number of MSCI Climate Paris Aligned ETFs. Last, in terms of business momentum, I was particularly pleased to see that State Street was recognized as the top provider in FX services by Euromoney Magazine in the second quarter. Importantly, State Street regained its 1 position overall for real money clients in addition to being ranked 1 for best service for real money clients. Our FX franchise supports and complements our core investment services business and has proven to be an effective deployment of our capital. Turning to our balance sheet and capital. Despite a continued rise in interest rates, our CET1 capital ratio improved significantly to 12.9% at quarter end due to our active management of risk-weighted assets and the mitigating actions we executed in our investment portfolio in the second quarter. The strength of our balance sheet was highlighted in the second quarter with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test results in June, following which we announced our intention to increase State Street's quarterly common stock dividend by 10% to $0.63 per share in the third quarter, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We were pleased to announce the intended increase to our quarterly common dividend as we recognize the importance of capital return to our shareholders. With that in mind, in the fourth quarter of this year, it remains our intention to resume our existing common share repurchase program in an amount reflecting interest rate levels and market conditions at that time. I'll now turn to our proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services business which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. We continue to be excited about the business and its people, the franchise it represents and the opportunities the transaction represents for our collective clients, and for accelerating our strategy. I've mentioned previously that we've been engaged in ongoing dialog with U.S. banking regulators regarding the regulatory review process and potential modifications to the transaction intended to facilitate resolution of that process. Based on those discussions, we have developed with BBH, proposed modifications to the transaction structure that the parties believe present a path forward. The proposed modifications include changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and changes to the regulatory approvals required to complete the transaction. As part of the proposed modified transaction, State Street is seeking amendments to the transaction terms, including the purchase price. Both BBH and our Board of Directors would need to review and approve the modified transaction in amended terms. During the third quarter, we intend to finalize the proposed structure and contractual terms and confirm our approach with regulators. Assuming the financial and operational aspects of the proposed modifications are timely finalized and contracted, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions, the parties are aiming to close the transaction at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. However, there exists significant timing uncertainty and risk that closing will extend beyond that time line. There can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will be entered into or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for this modified transaction. After September 6, 2022, either party can terminate the transaction without penalty, absent further agreement of the parties. To conclude, as we progress towards our medium-term targets in this uncertain environment, we remain particularly focused on maintaining and further improving our pretax margin performance, which despite the challenging market conditions, increased almost 29% for the quarter, excluding notable items. To help achieve this goal, in the face of inflationary pressure and a challenging revenue environment, we will continue to exhibit expense discipline and to drive our automation and productivity efforts. We also remain laser-focused on innovating for the benefit of our clients and driving organic growth, as demonstrated by the strong AUC/A wins in the second quarter, all while returning capital to our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Glenn, I'll take that. You're accurate. We have a small number. They tend to be very large clients where you just do hit the top of the fee schedule or even in some cases, the fees continued to tail down. I don't think we're close to that yet in terms of that being meaningful. So I wouldn't expect to see that being a factor in the near term unless we see a much more significant kind of market downturn. Operator, the next question. Yes, Ken, we're very much in the midst of this. So I don't want to get out ahead of it. Firstly, we remain committed to the combination on a strategic basis. But given that we foresee this being restructured in a way that it changes some of the operating model, some of the circumstances change. We do believe -- well, we know we believe some kind of a price adjustment would be warranted. I don't want to get ahead of where we are in discussions with PBH. They remain very amicable and both sides are committed to making this happen. We're committed to -- we like the business. We like the get there, then there's a lot of options, and we come back to you at that time. Yes. Betsy, it's Ron. I mean the September 6 date, it's basically the 1-year anniversary for the deal. And like a lot of transactions, they have an outside limit. So the way you should interpret that is what we've said is both parties remain committed. We've got to work through things. I mean the regulatory world and the political world has changed significantly since we announced this deal and what we're looking towards as a way to breakthrough and close it in a reasonable time period, and this time period doesn't seem reasonable to anybody, but it's actually better than some of the alternatives that we've been faced with. So if you think about the September 6, it's an existing date. And assuming everything is going along fine and parties are agreeing, then we just agree to an extension of that to the close date. Just disclosing and reminding everybody what the terms of the transaction are. Brennan, it's Ron. Why don't I start on this and Eric will fill in. We're early in this process, but yes, we have been out with clients and walk through our planned price increases with a few clients at this point. And there's a whole plan as Eric alluded. It's around the areas where we've got the most inflationary pressure which might be specialty areas, areas where there's limited capacity in the marketplace, areas that are just growing very rapidly. And interestingly, the earliest ones have been in some ways, I think clients were not surprised that it was coming at them. So I'm not saying that's the way it's going to be. None of us enjoy paying more for something today than what we paid yesterday. But we're going at this in a very fact-based way. These tend to be sophisticated institutional buyers, and they know what's going on. So I can't speak for what others are doing. I just don't have a feel for that. But we're running our business in the way we believe we need to. And we think this is an important component of it. Yes, Steve, what I would add to that is that throughout this period that we've been managing expenses over the last several years as we've been quite clear on, we've also been investing in the business, particularly around automation and technology. There's still payoffs expected from that. We've seen some. There's more in the future. So the other bit of this we'll be continuing to manage that algorithm between how much we continue to spend on automating more to get the future productivity savings. Yes. And then, Gerard, just the second part of your question, are we going at the asset-based fee, the variable fee or the fixed fee? I mean, it's a little bit of both. And again, we're trying to be reasonable firstly, to our clients, but also to ourselves and really tying this to where there's real inflationary pressures. And also recognizing that we have a commitment to generating really good service for our clients, right? Service better than our competitors. So it's less about is that the variable or the fixed, it's where are we having these pressures and therefore, where do we need a price increase. It's a good question, Mike. I would say that what's changed over the years is virtually everybody. You go back 15, 20 years ago, virtually everybody bought the same service. It was custody fund accounting. It was publicly listed markets. It was fairly consistent in playing and it was very easy to do, as you said. I think what's changed is that even -- certainly, in the medium to large managers, you're seeing a broad product base, some of which are actually reasonably complicated to do, whether it's complicated because of the skills required complicated because of the technology that's required. And it's in those areas where we're seeing the highest inflationary pressures. And we think that we offer a superior capability. We think that in many cases, there's just limited capacity in the marketplace. And we also think that it's a time where -- that everybody is seeing the same kind of pressure the last 10, 15, 20 years, the world's been enjoying, in effect, the great deflation. And that's not what's going on now. So it's always dangerous to utter those words. This time is different, so I won't. But we do think there's a set of circumstances in a targeted set of areas where pricing adjustments are required. And that we believe that clients will understand. And again, very early reads, but they seem to be. No. Mike, what I would say is what you say about comp costs lagging behind other inflationary expenses, I mean, that is true, and that's typical, right? That's typically how kind of inflation works its way into and through labor markets. I would say that we've certainly seen a much higher than trend pressure on us and I would venture since we're swimming in the same pool of skills here. I would say certainly with our nearing competitors in -- particularly in the skilled areas that we need. And as Eric noted, in some of the -- when we're replacing somebody that's come in at a much or a significantly higher cost than before. Now I think it's also true that if you believe that there's a recession facing us or that in any event, there will be less kind of economic growth going forward than what we see now for a period of time. That's likely to take pressure off it, but there's still a very real move up in select areas around our expenses. And I actually don't think it would be different for a comparable institution. Yes. That it's a good question. And again, because we're trying to be very fact-based and tie it to where there's increases and where we feel we need to do this. The answer is it varies. In some cases, it's around particular transactions or asset class types where we can institute in other cases. There is an agreement that we need to secure from the client but our goal is to -- I mean, obviously, the pressure is now. So we want to put it in as soon as possible. Again, we're early in this process. So we'll see what we accomplished in terms of overall timing. But I think given our approach, which, again, is based on facts and the realities of client situations, we're optimistic that we can accomplish something here. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you all for participating in the call, and thank you for your support."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.91 or $1.94 excluding acquisition and restructuring costs as detailed on the panel on the right side of the slide. As Ron noted earlier, the operating environment in the second quarter remained challenging, largely characterized by continued market volatility related to macroeconomic events and continued geopolitical uncertainties. As you can see on the left panel of the slide, strong growth in both net interest income and FX trading enabled us to partially offset significant headwinds from lower equity and fixed income markets in the quarter that impacted other fee areas. Also evidenced by today's results, our approach to expense management remains very disciplined and deliberate. On a year-on-year basis, second quarter expenses were down even as we experienced higher-than-expected wage increases and continue to thoughtfully invest in the franchise. Lastly, you'll see that in the second quarter, we had a lower-than-expected tax rate. The bulk of the discrete tax items that contributed to our lower taxes were due to the reassessment of a deferred tax asset worth roughly $60 million. All things considered during the quarter, our business model demonstrated resilience against the challenging backdrop. Turning to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw period-end AUC/A decrease by 10% on a year-on-year basis and 8% sequentially. Amidst continued and uncertain economic conditions, the year-on-year change was largely driven by lower period end market levels across just about every equity and fixed income market around the world, partially offset by net new business and client flows. The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely a result of the same lower period end market levels, as we've also started to see industry outflows from investment products as the risk off sentiment continues. Similarly, at Global Advisors, quarter-end AUM decreased 11% year-on-year and 14%, sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was also largely driven by lower period end market levels and institutional net outflows which was partially offset by positive net inflows in both our U.S. low-cost ETF complex and cash inflows in the quarter. Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see second quarter total servicing fees down 7% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels, normal pricing headwinds, client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business growth. Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down only 4% year-on-year. I'd also highlight that from a segment perspective, we continue to see excellent revenue growth in our alternative client segment, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 5%, primarily as a result of the same drivers, lower average equity and fixed income market levels, client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by positive net new business. Within servicing fees, back office fees were down 7% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the factors I just described. Middle Office Services was down 12% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to decreased client AUMs, driven by lower market levels and client transaction activity and adjustments. But we are seeing some compression in our legacy middle office book. It is an important component of our Alpha proposition when it connects to both the Front office and Back office and new wins generally come with contracts of 7 to 10 years. We continue to expect to see good growth over the medium term as evidenced by our large uninstalled middle office revenue backlog of more than $90 million, which I will talk more about in a moment. Even against this challenging backdrop, we continue to be pleased with our Investment Services business momentum and robust pipeline. We recorded another strong quarter of new AUC/A wins worth $972 billion while AUC/A won, but yet to be installed amounted to $3.6 trillion at quarter end. As Ron mentioned earlier, during second quarter, we reported another new Alpha win, Allspring Global Investments taking the total number of Alpha clients to 20 and now have 12 implementations live. Lastly, in response to industry inflationary cost pressures, we've undergone a comprehensive analysis of our pricing across all our product areas. The result of this analysis has led to the decision to begin to adjust our client pricing upwards in certain areas of servicing where the wage pressure is most acute and industry capacity is stretched. Ultimately, we believe these pricing changes will support the continued investment that allows us to best serve our clients. Turning to Slide 7. Second quarter management fees were $490 million, down 3% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels, the impact of currency translation and a specific client repricing adjustment, partially offset by the elimination of money market fee waivers and the run rate impact of net ETF inflows. Management fees were down 6% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds, partially offset by the elimination of the same money market fee waivers. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our franchise remains well positioned for growth. In ETFs, although we saw outflows in equity and commodities, we continue to see inflows into SPDR low cost and fixed income ETFs. In our Institutional Business, there's continued momentum in our target date franchise, notwithstanding outflows primarily from 1 large client with very low fee assets, which ultimately benefited the overall management fee rate this quarter. Across our cash franchise, we again saw another quarter of strong net inflows, this time worth $15 billion in the quarter, contributing to market share gains. On Slide 8, FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to a period a year ago, second quarter FX trading services revenue was up 16%, primarily driven by higher FX spreads, partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, FX trading services revenue was down 8% as the benefit of higher FX spreads was more than offset by lower client FX volumes too. Our second quarter securities finance revenues decreased slightly year-on-year, primarily driven by lower agency and enhanced custody balances due to lower markets, partially offset by higher spreads. Sequentially, revenues were up 11%, mainly reflecting higher spreads, partially offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances. Second quarter software and processing fees were down 11% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by lower Front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Finally, other fee revenues of negative $43 million in the second quarter declined both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter declines largely reflect negative market-related adjustments while the absence of prior period positive fair value adjustments on equity investments also contributed to the sequential decline. While we saw pressure throughout the quarter, almost half of the $43 million came through in the second half of June. Moving to Slide 9. Let me provide some details on the performance of our Front office software and data revenue in the second quarter on the left panel of this slide. As a reminder, CRD represents the majority of these revenues, but we also include Alpha Data Services, Alpha Data Platform and Mercatus revenues since they are part of our Front office offering. On both a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis, Front office software revenue declined as expected, primarily driven by the absence of several on-premise renewals in the prior periods as well as some episodic fees when compared to the prior year quarter, partially offset by higher software-enabled SaaS revenue. It is important to note, however, that the more durable and recurring software-enabled and professional services revenues have continued to grow nicely with a year-on-year growth of 15%, demonstrating success in deploying our cloud-based SaaS platform environment to more clients. Turning to some of the softer metrics enabled by CRD and Alpha on the right panel, you'll see that our annual recurring revenue has grown 20% year-on-year as we convert more clients to SaaS, which we expect will create a stickier and more profitable business model. As for the middle office, we continue to have an extremely healthy backlog of uninstalled revenue worth $92 million, which is almost twice the prior year. Lastly, we are pleased to have announced another Alpha mandate win this quarter. We're also excited to have expanded an existing Alpha relationship this quarter, winning approximately $300 billion of new back office assets to custody from an asset owner client. This provides another proof point that our Alpha value proposition is working as we're gaining more of the wallet share over time. Turning to Slide 10. Second quarter NII increased 25% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and continued growth in loan balances. Relative to the first quarter, NII was up 15%. The sequential increase was largely driven by the improvement in both short and long end rates, which benefited our yields, together with continued growth in loan balances, partially offset by lower investment portfolio balances. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the quarter. Average deposits were down 6% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter, primarily related to the impact from currency translation and dollar strengthening, which accounted for almost half of the year-on-year decline and 2/3 of the sequential decline. The investment portfolio is now down modestly, and we have almost 60% of our securities now in held to maturity. We're pleased that our balance sheet is well positioned to recognize this interest rate and NII tailwinds and also protect OCI. Turning to Slide 11. Second quarter expenses, excluding notable items, decreased 1% year-on-year or increased 2% adjusted for currency translation. In response to the revenue environment, we have been proactively managing our expenses, including lowering our incentive compensation, in addition to carefully executing on our continued productivity savings efforts which generated approximately $60 million in year-on-year gross saves or approximately $150 million year-to-date. These savings enabled us to continue to self-fund the good portion of the 4% to 6% higher wage rates we're facing and the targeted investments in the business, including the Alpha product, technology infrastructure and broader automation. Compared to 2Q ‘21, compensation employee benefits was down 3% as lower incentive compensation, the impact of currency translation were partially offset by salary merit increases associated with wages and inflationary pressure and higher contractor spend. Excluding currency translation, compensation and employee benefits would have been up 1%. Information systems and communications expenses was down 2%, primarily due to the episodic credits related to vendor pricing optimization and infrastructure rationalization. Occupancy was down 4% due largely to currency translation. And other expenses were up 18%, primarily reflecting higher recoverable client-related expenses, which are offset in fee revenue, professional fees and travel costs. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, expenses were down due to seasonal expenses in the first quarter. Headcount increased quarter-on-quarter as we continue to in-source some strategic technology functions from vendors as well as support growth in Alpha. Overall, in light of the current macroeconomic environment, we have had pretty healthy pretax margin for the quarter at approximately 29%, excluding notable items, supported by active expense management and strong NII growth. Moving to Slide 12. On the right side of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are quite pleased to report CET1 of 12.9%, up 100 basis points happy with our performance under this year's CCAR with a calculated stress capital buffer well above the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a preliminary SCB at the floor. As a result, in June, we announced the planned 10% increase to our 3Q ‘22 quarterly common stock dividend, subject to Board approval, and it remains our intention to again begin our existing common share repurchase program in the fourth quarter in an amount reflecting market conditions at the time. To the left of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see this quarter, even against the backdrop of a challenging operating environment, we drove stronger and higher capital levels. During the second quarter, we completed several of the previously announced RWA optimization actions across our trading, lending and investment portfolios, reducing RWA $12 billion quarter-on-quarter. We also shifted about $20 billion of AFS securities to HTM. As a result, we limited AOCI from the investment portfolio to under $500 million or 40 basis points of CET1, even with a roughly 60 basis point upward interest rate move across the 2- and 5-year part of the curve. You'll see a larger AOCI move in the GAAP books, but much of that is ratio hedged and offset by the appreciating dollar effect on RWA with an offsetting goodwill and intangibles as well. Given that we have now significantly reduced the OCI risk to interest rate shocks by 75%, we are now comfortable operating somewhat below our standard target ranges for both CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. Turning to Slide 13. We provide a summary of our second quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I am pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates the strength of our business model. The current macroeconomic environment and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, notwithstanding, our strong growth in both net interest income and FX trading services enabled us to partially offset significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets highlighting the resiliency of our franchise. And our expenses remained well controlled, demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model. Now turning to outlook. We would like to provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter. At a macro level, while market rate expectations have been volatile, our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forward which suggests the year-end Fed funds rate of 3.5%. We expect other major international central banks to continue raising rates, with the ECB expected to start increasing rates in third quarter. The current spot level of global equity markets would imply that average equity markets in 3Q would be down 7% to 8% quarter-on-quarter, and U.S. dollar appreciation to be about 1 percentage point of headwind to revenues and tailwind to expenses, which will be included in our guide. Now in terms of the third quarter of 2022 and on a standalone State Street basis. Given the implied declines in average Global Markets, we expect total fee revenue to be down about 2% on a sequential basis. And we expect both servicing fees and management fees to be down 4% quarter-on-quarter, driven by weaker market levels. Turning to NII. Following 1 of the strongest sequential increases in the NII for many years in 2Q, we expect to deliver further growth with NII expected to increase 5% to 9% quarter-on-quarter, driven by the tailwind from Central Bank rate hikes. This outlook includes our expectation for some initial deposit outflow and rotation in 3Q. And for the full year, on a stand-alone State Street basis, we expect NII to increase 24% to 27%, which is significantly better than our prior full year guide of 18% to 20%. Next, we expect total expenses, excluding notable items, to increase just under 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by inflationary pressures on wages as we continue to target productivity initiatives and execute against our strategy with a deep focus on expense discipline. This focus enable us to drive positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items for the full year. Lastly, we would expect our 3Q tax rate to be approximately 20% for the quarter. And with that, let me turn the call back to Ron. Sorry, Glenn, and sorry you're breaking up on the audio. Could you -- I got bits of that, but could you repeat that, please, for the...? Sure, Glenn. Let me try to cover that. And I think you're focused on servicing fees and management fees. So let me do them both so that we have a little bit of context for you. On Page 6 of the materials on servicing fees, about the impact of client activity and adjustments. And on a year-on-year basis, largely due to the kind of lower levels of activities and sometimes that comes through with lower markets, that was worth about 1 percentage point of headwind on a year-on-year basis and about 2 points on a quarter-on-quarter basis for that. On management fees, there was a series of impacts quarter-on-quarter. Most of that was driven by market. There was 1 client that we called out but that would have been worth at most 1 to 2 percentage points of fees for that quarter. Yes, Ken, the uptick in the NII guide, I think probably both for the third quarter and then the full year, which we've updated is primarily driven by the higher yield curve and expectations in the U.S. plus some expectation that the ECB is going to start to seriously raise rates in the third quarter. And we've said that once the ECB crosses 25 basis point positive rate threshold, that begins to be accretive. So I think those are the major drivers. On investment portfolio yields, I think you see that in our average balance sheet. They are up on average, almost 15 basis points quarter-on-quarter. And you will expect that, that kind of increase will continue to flow through the books. To the question of exactly what a new security comes in at versus an old security rolls out at, I think the best way to estimate that because it will vary by different parts of the book, whether it's the treasuries, whether it's the MBS, whether it's the foreign securities is we're basically replenishing securities that have an average duration of 2.8 years. So you can kind of see what an older security with that vintage would look like and compare it to what's in the market today. And you'll see a nice pickup, and that's what's flowing through and giving us the kind of quarter-on-quarter increase on average that you saw this quarter. And we'll expect to see another increase on average in that order of magnitude in the third quarter. Betsy, it's Eric. Those are all the kinds of areas we're working through. And I think the heart of this when you do a banking deal, a global banking deal, this sort is the legal entity structure. And you obviously know we run a holding company, a bank, a series of banks and there's a series of entities that we have around the world. And obviously, creating a workable and a good path of combination can be done in different ways. And part of what we've been working through is modifications on what might have been our original plan to make the transaction workable and attractive. That then has some ramifications to your point on the operating model that will have some amount of effect on perhaps the pace of expense -- or pace of expense or revenue synergies, and that's what we're working through. What we have said, and we'd want to reiterate is that we are committed to finding a way to preserve the economic accretion that in the range that we had previously disclosed back in September. And so we're highly focused on that. And as a result, there are some changes that we're seeking on the transaction that including price that Ron mentioned. Sure, Betsy, it's Eric. I think the best place to see our capital ratios and targets is on Page 12 of the presentation deck. You see our -- what I'll call our standard CET1 targets, our 10% to 11% are standard leverage -- Tier 1 leverage targets of 5.25% to 5.75%. And what we've done, as you mentioned, is we've dramatically reduced the volatility risk from OCI which means that we're quite comfortable running below that. Directionally, that means on CET1, for example, could be up to 50 basis points below that. While we run at much lower risk and volatility levels in OCI and on a leverage basis, it tends to be about half of the -- of that amount. Sure, Brennan, it's Eric. And we actually added some additional disclosure in our addendum, our financial addendum this quarter. You'll find it on Page 8. That actually breaks out the balance sheet, including the total assets, the investment securities and deposits by the major currencies, USD, euros, pound sterling and so forth because we are quite focused on navigating this interest rate environment. To be honest, securing the benefits of interest rate increases around the world, right? We position the balance sheet currency by currency. We have pricing plans and betas that are carefully developed currency by currency. I don't think we expect a lot of change in the composition of the balance sheet. I mean, the U.S. is clearly -- the U.S. Central Bank is clearly moving much more quickly, and with not only interest rates, but quantitative tightening. And that will potentially have a downward trend on U.S. currency deposits. On the other hand, with U.S. rates prevailing rates higher than what you see around the rest of the world, there's a natural draw into the U.S. from global investors. So it's hard to -- I think it's hard to actually forecast the currency composition and the deposit levels given those movements. But we're well prepared. And in fact, some of the interest rate or some of the NII increases that you saw this quarter are coming not only by virtue of the U.S. rate rises, but also those in pound sterling and some of the other Anglo-Saxon currencies. And we're positioning currency by currency as a result. Jim, it's Eric. We're quite careful about managing our NII sensitivity holistically across the book. I think what you'll see is that because we use HTM to protect against interest rate and AOCI volatility, it's more natural that if we have a blended book of short-, medium- and longer-term securities that we would move more of the medium and longer-term securities into HTM because thereby, we get the most protection while we give up the least amount of sale optionality. So that's why you're just seeing a higher yield. I think you'll see that generally be true, and you can follow that in our disclosures accordingly. Yes. I think you've got the right broad time frame. I mean the -- I guess the way I would describe it is the larger the deal, the more complex and more transformative it is for our clients, right? That's the -- they're fundamentally changing their operating model, they're harmonizing systems and processes, and we're co-investing with them to build for them a front, middle and often back-office model that will suit them for a decade or more. As you think about the $3.6 trillion of AUC/A to be installed, 2023 is an important year. We expect that about 1/3. This will move around, but about 1/3 will likely be installed by the end of that year and perhaps as much as half of the revenue associated with those wins. Yes, that's correct. By the end of 2023. Brian, it's -- we're still in the process of nailing down both the legal entity and the operating model changes, and we're working through those and working towards developing a firm view of when and how the deposit and sweep program is operated, and how we may in the future, use that program, take advantage of some of the cash and deposit optionality. But that's in process at this point. And we'll certainly provide an update in the course of the third quarter I expect as we nail down the modifications. I think the last cycle is always going to be indicative, but you remember, there were moving parts in the last cycle, including the SLR rule was in flux and there was -- we -- many of us on the banking side had to navigate the size of our balance sheet independently what was happening at the interest rate environment and quantitative tightening. I think what I've said in the past is relevant over the -- since the kind of the pre-COVID time period, our deposits are up roughly $60 billion. We think that half of that can easily be ascribed to the quantitative easing that we had, and that will reverse out. Now that's estimated. It's always hard to forecast this because the interest rate environment is moving up quickly. There is also risk off environment. So we've got to see how that plays out. I've said that we could see $6 billion to $10 billion of outflows per year per $1 trillion of U.S. balance sheet tightening. I do think because the interest rate environment is higher and has moved faster, right, we're likely to see closer to the $10 billion per $1 trillion in the first year and then maybe lighten out in the second and third year. But those are all the scenarios we're working through. I think from our perspective, we're extremely flushed from a liquidity standpoint. The deposits are valuable, so we're monetizing them for the purpose of the P&L. And we expect over time to be able to only get to the higher levels of NII that we have in the past. I think we were in the $695 million range with our peak during the last cycle, I think our forecast -- and it's hard to forecast this perfectly. But the forecast that we've built put us at or above that level in this next cycle. And part of that is that while there is some tightening and erosion of total deposit levels, you also have higher U.S. rates, higher global rates and in particular, we'll have a move in ECB and European rates, at least based on the current forwards. Sure. Let me start on fees. The real environmental challenge is if you just extend out the current spot levels of that equity markets are sitting at, the average -- the daily average for third quarter is going to be down 7% to 8% versus the average for second quarter. And that's the basis by which we earn revenues both in servicing fees and management fees. So that's the headwind that we have. We're hoping that some of the market related -- the lumpy sub that we have in other revenues doesn't repeat and that might give us a little bit of insulation. So that's why I said servicing and management fees could be down the 4% range sequentially, but total fees, perhaps closer to 2%, So less so. And obviously, volatility levels in markets help currency trading and other activities. But we've got to play out and see how the summer months happen. I think on expenses, I'm just trying to guide quarter-by-quarter. I think if you add up first quarter, second quarter, the guide of just under 1 percentage point for the third quarter. And you can put a range around that and estimate fourth quarter. And so we're -- I think that's what we've done from a guidance standpoint. I think what we are willing to say is because we have kind of an overall view of fee revenues for third quarter, we can guesstimate into fourth quarter as can you. I think NII, we have quite a solid view of the full year, which we've provided. We're comfortable of saying and we said in our prepared remarks that we expect to drive positive total operating leverage for the year, adjusted for notables. But we feel confident in that given the current market environment. And part of that is we have some visibility, as we've described on fees, a good bit of visibility on NII. And to be honest, while there are some wage and inflationary pressures because the P&L is lighter, we've proactively adjusted the incentive line to compensate for that. And we're committed to navigating through this environment in a thoughtful way and deliver results that are as positive and as appropriate as possible. Yes. And I think we'll know more over the course of the year, but I think there are some inflationary pressures, some of which we can look for ways to at least limit, but we can't really avoid. So let me give you an example. On the $8 billion expense base that we have, about $2.5 billion of that is salaries. Now salaries historically have moved up about 2 percentage points a year, maybe 3 but right now, if you look at merit increases, the higher salary replacement rates for new hires versus exits, bidding back selectively talent, salary costs are up closer to 4% to 6% on a run rate basis on a base of $2.5 billion. So you could do the math there and start to get a sense that, that creates an additional headwind that we didn't have and that headwind could be worth an extra point of expenses on the total $8 billion base. It's that kind of environment that we're operating in. I mean we need to see if that persists into next year. Do we have a recession or not, what happens to labor markets. And then the other part of that is working through where we are on non-comp expenses, where vendors come to us sometimes and say, look, we feel the need to adjust, and we're obviously trying to manage and rein that in. And I think that's another factor. So I think we see some of those. We're trying to telegraph them, but we're also committing to -- committed to achieve and deliver on our medium-term targets. And some of that's going to be by finding in some ways to maybe limit or contain or offset. But in other ways, they may come through. The interest rate environment will give us a tailwind. And then you heard us describe some of the selective changes that we're discussing with clients around pricing and top line pricing. So there are a number of different factors. I think I'm not -- it's early to give a fulsome view of what next year portends. But I would say that we're conscious, we're in a elements that we can control and others that aren't as controllable. But we're also committed to getting to our medium-term targets. And I think that provides a good set of goals for us and that we're committed to. Yes. Let me -- Gerard, let me start. Our pricing schedules, there's a lot of history behind them on the servicing fee side. I would say that -- and we disclosed this in our Q with some specificity, but about half of the revenues earned through the servicing fee schedules are market level dependent. So the kind of assets under custody levels. There's then a portion that is driven by transactional or activity of volumes and then the balance is fixed. So there is a mix. And that's what you're seeing flowing through the P&L at this point. They are complex schedules. They -- you can measure them with a ruler in some cases, just because they span the world. They expand products and regions and entities and often have some history associated with them. But that's a broad basis. Sure. Let me do that in pieces. Then the HTM portfolio, I think there's good data for you and others in the financial addendum. And you can find that on Page 9 of our agendum. The -- we described the AFS portfolio both on average and on an end-of-period basis in the HTM portfolio. And I think in total, the yield on AFS right now is about 91 basis points, on the held-to-maturity about 155 basis points. And that's just because of the duration that we tend to put in held-to-maturity to protect it from OCI. In terms of the accretion that will come through, we expect the accretion to start towards the fourth quarter, in particular, a little bit in the third and then into the fourth quarter. And we're looking at accretion in the $100 million to $200 million range of capital. It will bounce around quarter-by-quarter as different maturities come through. But that's a healthy amount of capital accretion, and that could be worth 10, 15 basis points of capital and could certainly help us fund the future buybacks and other returns of capital to shareholders, which, as we've said, we'd like to restart in the fourth quarter and continue on from there. Mike, that's on deposits, remember, we've been under-earning on deposits against what cost us to hold deposits, which is preferred securities, right, for -- now several years, we barely offset that at the height of the last interest rate increase in 2017 and ‘18. And so -- we're just trying to get to par on deposit spreads. And obviously, as deposit rates rise, we give a reasonable proportion of that back to our clients. So we do that purposely. That's part of the social contract. But that feels like it's going back to a normalized level, the wage and salary and non-comp pressures that we're seeing are not different than what others are seeing in the rest of the economy. And that on a net basis is quite different. Yes. We -- as you recall, Rob, we had, in the first quarter, consciously deployed more RWA in some of our business activities, in particular in trading and in lending, just because we were -- we had a surplus amount of capital and so we put it to work and had some good revenues. This quarter, we're writing that back in, partly because we were driving -- we were committed to driving our capital ratios upward. And partly, to be honest, we've found some opportunities for optimization. So I talked about more of a -- more than a $10 billion reduction quarter-on-quarter. That came across businesses and securities finance that came in the lending book where some of the loans qualified for margin loan treatment, which comes at a different RWA level. And then we had some amount of credit, I'll call it, sort of credit-light in the investment portfolio that was 100% risk weighted that we allowed to roll off. So there were some tactical adjustments that we made in that -- on that basis. We also tend to have some volatility in RWA. The FX derivatives book can move around by $3 billion, $4 billion, and that was -- that we got a good balance there. So I think about 1/3, I'd say, was of the $10 billion to $12 billion quarter-on-quarter reduction was a good balance, and we'll take those. But that could actually that $3 billion to $4 billion could bounce back up in the third quarter, and we're obviously considering that we continue to accrete through the P&L every quarter. And I think we're quite comfortable with our capital ratio trajectory into the third quarter and also in such a way that we can prepare for buybacks in the fourth quarter as well."

Now let me turn it over to Ron.\nRonald O’Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the operating environment in the first quarter, which included both significant geopolitical events as well as notable macroeconomic developments and market movements.  Turning to Slide 3 of our presentation. First, I would like to acknowledge the ongoing events in Europe following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In March, I traveled to crack out to visit some of State Street's approximately 6,400 employees in Poland. During my visit, I was moved by the selflessness of our colleagues in Poland, who continue to support displaced Ukrainian people in a number of important ways from opening their own homes and providing shelter to offering professional support, such as interpretation services. While State Street's direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is very small, our teams are responding fluidly to the situation and delivering for our affected clients and other stakeholders with dedication and professionalism in what continues to be a stressful time. We have well-established and regularly tested business continuity plans designed to continue critical services for our clients and support for our people. The first quarter also saw dramatic market movements, driven partially by the conflict in Ukraine, plus a broader set of macroeconomic forces. A tight labor market, rising energy prices, continued supply chain disruptions and the ongoing effects of significant COVID-related fiscal stimulus has contributed to inflation reaching multi-decade highs. As a result, in March, we saw the first interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve since late 2018, a substantial upward move in long-end interest rates as well as volatile currency and equity markets and a stronger U.S. dollar. Each of these factors in part shaped State Street's financial results in the first quarter, which I will now discuss before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail.  Starting with our financial performance. First quarter '22 EPS increased 15% year-over-year and was up 8%, excluding notable items, with earnings growth supported by both higher total fee revenue and stronger net interest income, leading to an improved year-over-year total revenue performance in the first quarter. Within fee revenue, our global markets franchise performed particularly well, driven by higher FX market volatility. And while State Street's revenue performance improved, we also remain highly focused on controlling the expense base. Notwithstanding continued new investments in our business and operational capabilities, first quarter total expenses were flat year-over-year and increased just 1%, excluding notable items, supported by ongoing productivity efforts and the stronger U.S. dollar.  Taken together, we delivered both positive fee and total operating leverage as well as pretax margin expansion, good earnings growth and higher return on equity relative to the year ago period.  Turning to our business momentum, which you can see across the middle of the slide, we recorded another quarter of solid new AUC/A asset servicing wins, which amounted to $302 billion in the first quarter, while AUC/A won but not yet installed amounted to $2.9 trillion at quarter-end. Front office software and data also experienced good business momentum with annual recurring revenue for the first quarter, increasing 15% year-over-year to $235 million.  At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $4.0 trillion at quarter-end. Importantly, we saw another quarter of solid net inflows of $51 billion despite the volatile market environment in the first quarter. Our ETF business continued to perform well as we further focused on innovation and enhancing our ETF product offering. For example, in January, Global Advisors launched 3 new ESG-oriented SPDR ETFs across small-cap international and emerging market equities, aimed at helping investors incorporate ESG considerations into their portfolios. In February, Global Advisors expanded its fixed income offering with the debut of the actively managed SPDR Blackstone high income ETF as we continue to innovate in the active ETF category, which accounted for 13% of U.S. net industry flows in the first quarter.  At State Street Digital, we announced a number of exciting developments. In March, we entered into a licensing agreement with Copper co, a provider of institutional digital asset custody and trading infrastructure. We intend to leverage Copper.co's technology to develop an institutional-grade digital custody offering where clients can store and settle their digital assets within a secure environment operated by State Street.  Turning to capital. Our ratios remained healthy, although CET1 declined quarter-over-quarter, largely due to lower AOCI, driven by the significant moves in interest rates. In the coming quarters, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital ratios.  Regarding BBH, the regulatory review process for the proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business has progressed more slowly than we anticipated. While many required approvals have been obtained, some required regulatory approvals, most notably approval to the relevant federal banking agencies, remain outstanding. We are evaluating potential modifications of the transaction that are intended to facilitate resolution of the bank regulatory review. We are working towards concluding regulatory reviews during the third quarter.  While we are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the relevant federal banking agencies, there can be no assurance of the timing or outcome of their regulatory review. Both parties, State Street and BBH, continue to be excited about the overall financial and strategic opportunities of combining BBH Investor Services with our business. We are continuing to work closely with the BBH team on pre-integration planning. This includes all the preparatory work in product, operations, technology as well as employee communication and client planning. We still expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share in the first quarter -- first year post closing.  To conclude my opening remarks, the first quarter was defined by both unexpected significant geopolitical events and notable macroeconomic and market developments, in the face of which State Street delivered an improved year-over-year financial performance and solid business momentum metrics while supporting our clients and colleagues. As we look ahead in this environment of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and market volatility, we remain laser-focused on delivering what is within our control, including excellence of strategic execution across the front, middle and back office, maintaining the recent improvement in our sales effectiveness and expense discipline all while continuing to provide valuable insights and promote better outcomes for the owners and managers of the world's capital.  And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.57 or $1.59 excluding acquisition and restructuring costs. On the left panel of this slide, you can see we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth with strength in many of our businesses, notwithstanding the macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we held total expenses roughly flat year-on-year as we continue to both invest in the franchise and control expenses. As a result, we generated positive operating leverage of about 5 percentage points in the quarter and continue to improve our pretax margin year-over-year. All things considered, this was another strong quarterly performance, demonstrating the progress we are making as we continue to improve our operating model and drive growth.  Turning to Slide 5. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 4% year-on-year and decreased 4% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year change was largely driven by higher period end equity market levels, client flows and net new business growth. The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely the result of lower period end market levels in both equity and bond markets. Similarly, at Global Advisors, AUM increased 12% year-on-year, but declined 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the increase was also driven by higher period end market levels coupled with strong net inflows across all 3 of our franchises, our ETF, institutional and Cash businesses.  The sequential decline was primarily driven by lower market levels, which was partially offset by strong net inflows of $51 billion in the quarter.  Turning to Slide 6. Before I start, I would like to remind you that we are expanding our servicing fee revenue disclosures by disaggregating the line into back-office servicing fees and middle office services. With that, on the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees were flat year-on-year as higher client activity and flows average equity market levels and net new business were offset by normal pricing headwinds and a 2% currency translation headwind.  We continue to see good growth in both our insurance and official institutions client segments. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 1%, primarily as a result of the seasonal pricing headwinds and lower average equity market levels partially offset by strong client activity. Within servicing fees, back office fees were flat both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the factors I just described.  Middle office servicing was down 3% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to a partial transition from a legacy climb and lower professional services fees in the quarter. Notwithstanding the decline in the quarter, middle office is an important component of our Alpha proposition when it comes to both the front office when it connects to both the front and back office, and we expect to see good growth over the medium term. As evidenced by our uninstalled revenue backlog, which I'll talk more about in a moment.  In terms of business momentum, I'm pleased with how 2022 has started. As we report another quarter of solid new AUC/A wins of $302 billion, while AUC/A won 1 but yet to be installed, amounted to $2.9 trillion at quarter end. We continue to be happy with our pipeline, and I'm also particularly pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of strategically important premium and preferred clients.  Turning to Slide 7. First quarter management fees were $520 million, up 5% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and strong ETF inflows. Management fees were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity market headwinds, partially offset by the tailwind of lower fee waivers and net inflows. Of note, our management fee performance for the quarter was supported by strong net inflows of $51 billion with positive inflows across our entire business franchise, Institutional, Cash and ETF.  With respect to money market fee waivers, the fee waiver impact to management fees for the quarter was roughly $10 million, down from about $20 million in the fourth quarter. I would note that following the 25 basis point Fed hike we saw in March of this year, we no longer expect money market fee waivers to be a headwind to management fees starting in April. As you can see on the bottom of the slide, our franchise remains well-positioned for growth. I'm particularly pleased that the strategic actions that we've previously taken in our long-term Institutional and ETF franchises are now helping to draw inflows even in the current volatile market environment.  On Slide 8, you can see that FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the period a year ago, FX trading services revenue was up 4% year-on-year and 20% quarter-on-quarter. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter performance benefited from high FX market volatility while higher client FX volumes also contributed sequentially. Part of the revenue uptick has come from about $5 billion in higher risk-weighted assets we put to work this quarter, which demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility and which I'll come back to in a moment.  Our securities finance revenues decreased 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower average agency assets alone, partially offset by solid new business wins in enhanced custody. Sequentially, revenues were down 6%, mainly reflecting lower average agency and enhanced custody balances due to the declining market levels and fewer specials. First quarter software and processing fees were up 26% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which I'll turn to shortly.  Finally, other fee revenue of $29 million almost doubled year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, mainly reflecting fair value adjustments on equity investments.  Moving to Slide 9. We've provided a breakdown of our consolidated front office software and data revenue on the left. We've broken down the revenue into software categories you have seen us use before, on-premise, professional services and software-enabled revenue. While CRD represents a large majority of this line, Alpha Data Services, Alpha Data Platform and [indiscernible] revenues are also included here as well. As we've highlighted earlier, front office software revenue growth was particularly strong, up 44% year-on-year, primarily driven by on-premise renewals as well as the continued strong growth in software-enabled and professional services revenues.  On the right of the slide, we've provided some key growth metrics enabled by CRD and Alpha. As I mentioned earlier during today's presentation, you'll notice that we've broken out both the front office and middle office uninstalled revenue backlog, both of which are key components of our alpha proposition going forward. The front office backlog of $93 million is up 43% and the middle office backlog has more than tripled year-on-year to $63 million. The backlogs reflect expected annualized revenue, which can be compared to the $900 million of annual revenue base in 2020 across both the front and middle office businesses and is an indicator of future revenue growth once fully installed.  The Alpha pipeline remains promising despite the current geopolitical environment as clients realize the transformational benefits to their technology and operations infrastructure.  Turning to Slide 10. As we see the start of another rate tightening cycle, first quarter NII increased 9% year-on-year, primarily driven by growth in our investment portfolio coupled with higher loan balances, which will also benefit us in future quarters. Relative to the fourth quarter, NII was up 5%, which came in better than expected due to higher long end rates. The sequential increase was largely driven by the improvement in both short and long end rates, which benefited our yields together with higher investment portfolio balances.  On the right of this slide, we show our average balance sheet during the first quarter, which has been relatively steady. Average assets were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower 1Q deposit balances, which are down slightly from the seasonally high fourth quarter, but up year-on-year.  Turning to Slide 11. First quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 1% year-on-year or 2% adjusted for currency translation. Productivity savings and targeted investments remain on try for the first quarter as we generated approximately $90 million in year-on-year growth savings and self-funded most of the strategic investments we've been making in the businesses, including technology infrastructure, broader automation, Alpha and State Street Digital. Compared to first quarter on a line item basis, excluding notable items, compensation and employee benefits was down 1% as lower head count in high-cost locations and the tailwind of currency translation was partially offset by higher seasonal expenses.  Information systems and communication expenses were up 5% due to continued investment in our technology infrastructure and resiliency. Occupancy was down 13% due to footprint optimization and lower maintenance costs and other expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher professional fees.  Relative to the fourth quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal expenses partially offset by productivity and footprint optimization savings. Headcount increased slightly quarter-on-quarter as we began to in-source some technology functions from vendors and growth in Alpha. Overall, we remain focused on delivering positive total and fee operating leverage and have demonstrated that this quarter amidst the current macroeconomic environment.  Moving to Slide 12. We show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio decreased by 2.4 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 11.9% due to both numerator and denominator effects. RWA increased by roughly $15 billion or 160 basis points of CET1 during the first quarter of 2022 compared to year-end, driven by 3 factors: a modest rebound from an unusually low fourth quarter; a strategic and temporary allocation of additional RWA capital to our markets businesses to generate the higher-than-expected first quarter revenues that we just discussed; and lastly, the RWA impact from the SA-CCR implementation that started on January 1 of this year, which we had planned for. At the same time, our capital base was also impacted by the substantial reduction in AOCI of about $1.3 billion, worth 110 basis points of CET1 relative to the fourth quarter as we saw a significant and historic quarter-on-quarter movement in long-end rates, particularly in the belly of the curve.  For instance, the rise in the 5-year U.S. treasury of roughly 120 basis points was the largest in the last 30 years. Taken together, the increase in RWA, coupled with a meaningful reduction in AOCI, partially offset by about 35 basis points of earnings accretion, net of dividends, drove the decrease in our CET1 ratio this quarter.  In contrast, first quarter Tier 1 leverage was down only slightly to 5.9%, mainly driven by the substantial decrease in AOCI, reflecting a significant change in the interest rate environment and a stable balance sheet.  While capital return remains an explicit priority for us, and we recognize its important to our shareholders, given this $1.3 billion move in AOCI related to higher interest rates, we no longer expect to resume our share repurchase program in the second or third quarter as we operate with a conservative balance sheet philosophy.  Given the volatility in rates and the possibility of further significant increases, we are in the process of taking several actions to reduce AOCI risk by about half. This primarily includes shifting additional AFS securities to HTM as well as shortening the portfolio duration through swaps lowering extension risk and consciously allowing some portfolio runoff. Some of these latter actions can be reversed in the future when we choose to reinvest at higher rates.  Turning to Slide 13. We provide a summary of our first quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I'm pleased with our financial performance, which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our businesses. Total fee revenue was up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher management fees, FX trading, software and processing fees and other fee revenues. Expenses were well-controlled and were held roughly flat year-on-year, demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model.  Next, I would like to provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter outlook and some of our economic assumptions as we look out over the year. At a macro level, while we know that rate assumptions have been moving, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests a year-end Fed funds rate of 2.5%. In terms of second quarter of 2022, we expect overall fee revenue to be down about 2% on a sequential basis, with servicing fees up about 1% and management fees up 2% to 3%, assuming equity markets remain flat to March 31 levels for 2Q and some downward normalization in FX trading revenues.  In terms of some of our newer fee revenue line items that we started to disclose this quarter, we would not expect to see a repeat of the size of on-premise renewals in the front office software line nor the positive equity investment markups in the other revenue line in 2Q.  Regarding NIIs, we now expect 2Q NII to increase 7% to 9% sequentially, which will be driven by the expected Fed rate hikes, partially offset by the AOCI mitigating portfolio actions that I outlined earlier. For full year 2022, we now expect to see year-on-year NII growth of around 18% to 20% and depending on Fed actions and rate moves as well as the shape of our portfolio.  Turning to expenses. We remain laser-focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs. We expect that second quarter expenses ex-notable items will be up around 2% to 3% on a sequential quarter basis, excluding notable items and seasonal compensation of expenses of $208 million.  On taxes, we expect that the 2Q '22 tax rate will be around 20%. We continue to expect to deliver on our goals of margin expansion and positive total and fee operating leverage for the year.  And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRonald O’Hanley: Thank you, Eric. And operator, we can now open it up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We have our first question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKenneth Usdin: Eric, just a follow-up on all things related to the rate environment. Just wondering, first of all, on the commentary about considering some alternatives with regards to the Brown Brothers deal. Can you elaborate what that might mean? Is that potentially some type of -- that thing you might have to fix on the capital side? Or is that related to just timing and deal structure? Any help there would be appreciated.\nEric Aboaf: Ken, it's Eric. No, capital from a capital perspective, we're quite comfortable with closing. We've got almost 12% capital ratios today. We've got a very, I think, smooth path to being prepared for a close from a capital perspective. The modifications we're talking about are just around the underlying structure of the transaction. And you've seen this done from time to time before. But we're working through legal entity and subsidiary structure, the exact transfer of systems and third-party contracts. Some of the transition servicing agreements, those kind of structure and modifications that we think will make this a cleaner process and be favorable on several fronts.\nKenneth Usdin: And then is there any updated thoughts about general zone of what you might think about for potential closing?\nEric Aboaf: As Ron had said, the regulatory review process has taken a bit longer. We've obviously been heavily engaged in that process because of some of the modifications that we're working through jointly with Brown Brothers leadership team. We're deeply in the process of getting additional and refined submissions in. Those will take several months for review and further dialogue. I think you have a sense for how this plays out. And that's why in the prepared remarks, I think Ron described that we expect those reviews to come through during the third quarter. I think at that point, we obviously then sprint to a close. And depending on exactly what month and what week those come through, then we look for -- you take out the calendar, you look at the weekends and do the usual, how do we now just close, but we've got to always close carefully, just given the usual financials and controls that you want to be mindful of.\nKenneth Usdin: Okay. And just -- I guess I'll ask a starter one on NII and then leave it to others. But just can you -- do you know just the impact related to the restructuring type of actions versus what you might have thought for NII?\nEric Aboaf: There's a range of that. I think you've seen us guide to NII up for the quarter of up 7% to 9%. And that on a year-on-year basis is actually going to be quite nice. I think it's -- is it worth a percentage 0.2 or 0.3. It's those kinds of, I think, adjustments that we're willing to make so that we both run an appropriate portfolio in what could be a highly volatile rate environment, including another possibility of rates could move another 50, 100 basis points, and we want to have a portfolio that can withstand that. And to be honest, we're willing to take a few percentage points of NII growth off the table on a sequential basis to do that. So I think it's a balance, but that's the range. And even with some of those adjustments, a lot of what we'll be doing is in the move from AFS to HTM, which is not NII impacting. There are others on the margin that are, but that's kind of the range that I'd share with you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So the SEC wants to implement T+1 by the end of next year. I saw the comment letters, including yours. My personal opinion is nobody is ready for it in the industry. So I'm curious why the move from T+2 to T+ -- I'm sorry, T+3 to T+2 was kind of easy and T+2 to T+1 everybody seems to be pushing back. Is it the complexity and shorter time horizon? Is the money to spend on the technology? It's just a little weird to me.\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes, Glenn, it's Ron. Why don't I take that? I mean I think that if you look back in history, everybody has resisted these moves to some degree because it does involve some spending of money and changing in systems and all that. We've spent a fair amount of time on this and thought about this and have been in conversations with regulators and it will be an added burden, but we don't think it's something the industry can't get done in a reasonable amount of time. So I'm not -- I haven't read other people's comment letters. I know how we've thought about it. So we think it will be one of these things like a LIBOR, if you will, more recent history, that will take a lot of time, take a lot of effort, but it's certainly not something that's going to, in our mind, sideline us or sideline other major players.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Just a sort of a clarification here. The expense guide, Eric, that was plus 2% to 3% quarter-over-quarter and -- but we're supposed to x out the seasonality, right? So do we back out -- what exactly is the right base that we're supposed to -- do we take the $2,318 million and then back out the $208 million and then grow that?\nEric Aboaf: Let me just open up the slide. So I think you're doing it, Brennan, in line with how we've described it. Yes, you can take the first on Slide 11 of the slide deck that $2.318 billion of expenses. That includes the seasonal expenses, which are on the footnote, right, of $208 million, you can pull that out and then you can add 2% to 3% sequentially and get an estimate for second quarter. That's correct.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Okay. And then thinking about the deposits. What -- when you were talking about the decline in deposits, you flagged a normal seasonality, which would suggest that there wasn't anything that's unusual that you've been seeing, but we've started to see rates back up in the market. The policy hikes -- we already see 1 policy hike, likely to see quite a pace here in the next few meetings, how is dialogue with your customers? What are your expectations, updated expectations around deposit action? And do you have any kind of estimate about where you might think you could see deposit growth or runoff end up shaking out here in the -- at least next quarter or two.\nRonald O’Hanley: Sure, Brennan. For the time being, we've seen little movement in deposits other than a little bit of seasonality, a little bit of currency translation has also played through. But this is all within the bounds of what we'd expect. And we've obviously been watching deposits carefully across currency pools and across client segments. And for the time being, it's been flattish, regardless of which way we look at it. As we go forward, we like many others have tried to guesstimate, and I use the word guesstimate not estimate, the level of shift in deposits, movement of deposits that we'll see with the amount of quantitative tightening that the Fed has announced. And I guess the best context I have for you and others is if we go back to the kind of pre-COVID era, we've grown our deposit base since then by $60 billion to $70 billion. We've also increased our AUC/As by about 25% during that time period. And because of those quarterly, we estimate that about half of the increase of $30 billion to $35 billion has come from the quantitative easing as the Fed extended the sedan the other central banks primarily that expanded its balance sheet by effectively $3 trillion.  And so we see that reversing over time with the rough math being for every $1 trillion of balance sheet, we'd expect a $6 billion to $10 billion runoff in our deposits. And they started in May or June, we'll see exactly when they get going at their announced pace. Yes, you could see a little trickle down, we think, in the fourth quarter and then the kind of the $6 billion to $10 billion per year after that.  So that's our guesstimate. We're obviously plus with deposits, and we're happy to be plus with deposits as rates drive. So we'll monetize them for the time being. But that's our guess right now. The other factors are how the interest rate hikes play out. We expect betas to be similar, but they're never exactly the same as they are before. And so we'll be sharply focused there. So those are some of the moving parts in some of our thinking at this point.\nOperator: Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Last year, you announced State Street Digital. And I wanted to get a sense as to how that's going relative to expectations. What you've been able to execute on there? And what your clients are asking you to do more of?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes. They've had a lot going on, Betsy. Maybe I'll focus on that last question first because this is a very client-intensive decision and spending a lot of time on it. I think the single biggest thing clients are asking for is help with the kind of a comprehensive regulatory framework. This is particularly acute in the U.S., the lack of guidance and the lack of -- really an agreed upon framework is has left a lot of uncertainty and see what institutions can do, particularly banks. So that's out there.  I think most of it, though, beyond that, Betsy, would be around and where we're spending a lot of time is, firstly, around enabling clients to invest in digital assets. And that's not just the trading of them, but it's the movement of them. It's the control of them. It's the custody of them, that's a portfolio accounting of them. So it's really, if you think about what we do now for digital assets, tokens, coins, et cetera. I think the other very large thing that the group is focused on, which it's less about external products and much more about how does State Street itself move into a digitalized world more than it is already? And what does it mean for the core operations such as custody, securities movement and control, which is really about, for lack of a better term, the next stage of digitalization. We are working a lot with the major players in the industry because these ecosystems are forming. And in some cases, we actually want to be a very integral part of the ecosystem and in other cases, we actually want to access that. So there's quite a bit going on there. is where I would summarize my answer to you.\nBetsy Graseck: And would you say that -- yes, go ahead.\nEric Aboaf: And Betsy -- it's Eric. I was just going to add. The other thing we're doing is, obviously, where clients, especially institutional clients have added crypto holdings within their fund, right? We're effectively providing some of the services you'd expect. And so we've gone through the -- across our client base. They have about 73 funds, I think, at that count with $0.5 billion of crypto exposure, we're effectively record keeping, right, those assets as part of their underlying funds. And then I think more broadly, where clients are developing specific ETFs and exchange-traded products, that's where we are in an industrious way signing them up for the administration and recordkeeping because that, in a way, is our view as one of the next land grabs because as the ETF and ETP products that comes of age, that's where we'll see some significant inflows.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And would you say you're at scale for these offerings? Or there's more investment to do to get to scale?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes. I mean, I think where we are now is of adequate scale, but one would expect that more scale will be required. But as much excitement as there is around this, it's still a relatively small proportion of total investment assets. So I think we're at adequate scale. I think the focus now is more on how do we think about additional capabilities growing.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. No, I totally get that. But as CBD fees come through, it's going to be critical to have this infrastructure -- central bank digital currencies.\nOperator: Next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Just back to BBH, just on that timing of closing one more time. I guess potentially could move into the fourth quarter. Just -- is it safe to say that you think this would certainly close before year-end? And is there any risk to it not closing under without changing the terms dramatically. And is it mostly the U.S. regulatory side as opposed to non-U.S?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes. I mean, Brian, the regulatory environment is uncertain, probably gotten more so over the last couple of years been less so, but we are making progress. It is taking longer than we anticipated. We're in dialogue. So it's not like there's -- we're not doing anything or there's silence on all this. We're in a fair amount of dialogue and working the kind of the restructuring that we referred to earlier is explicitly aimed at trying to accelerate this that we view speed is of the essence here. But there's a fair amount of uncertainty. So as I said in my prepared remarks, and Eric just reiterated, what we're targeting at this point and assuming that there'll be a -- this review will get done in the third quarter. And then as Eric noted, the actual -- once the review is done, the close itself isn't going to take a lot of time. I mean everything is ready. The money is in place. There's been a fair amount of integration planning, but it really is around the uncertainty of both the timing and the outcome of these regulatory reviews. And yes, it's mostly -- right now, the open ones are mostly the U.S. banking regulators.  We've received lots of approvals from around the world, both from financial services regulators and the antitrust regulators globally. So I don't want to minimize what has been done. But this is one of those things that may be not done until the last one is done.\nBrian Bedell: Yes. That makes sense. That's great color. And then just on the -- maybe on the deposit side again. So obviously, Ron, BBH gave you pretty good capability to bring on incremental deposits, and I know it's getting pushed out a little bit. But maybe, Eric, if you want to just -- if you can sort of update us on your thoughts or just reconfirm your original thoughts about the level of BBH deposits that would be coming on if it were to close today, for example, and then your appetite for bringing more deposits on, I think it was up to $20 billion of additional deposits at some point. Maybe just to talk about how you're thinking about that, if there's any change in that thought process other than the delay? And is the core BBH fundamentals right now, I assume, at least on the interest side, those are probably tracking better given the additional Fed hikes since the last guide.\nEric Aboaf: Ryan, it's Eric. We've been pleased as we've been monitoring and working closely with Brown Brothers on the business, the business performance. It's -- it had a good finish last year. It's had a performance in the first quarter that's within the bands that we had expected. And obviously, there's a little bit of NII tailwind in there, offset by a little bit of equity market, a downtick. But it's a -- business is performing well. We're -- we continue to be excited about it. And the partners, the 9 partners that have been operating that business that are coming over to us are doing a fine job as we'd expect, which is really, really nice to see.  In terms of the deposits and the close and the assets and the modifications and the broader questions. You're asking about the underlying economics of the transaction. I'm not going to go into detail on that at this point. I think Ron in his prepared remarks affirmed that the economics are sound that they'll be accretive within the first year. And what I'd tell you is, as we work through the modifications, which is oftentimes a legal entity kind of structure where we in the finance and treasury side are working very closely with our legal colleagues to navigate those modifications and make sure that they preserve the economic and the accretion that we're looking for. And so we continue to be positive, and we think it will be positive for shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Eric, can you share with us -- I think you -- in your comments when you were talking about the CET1 ratio that you used the temporary allocation of additional RWA to capture some market business that generated some better revenues for you in the quarter. Can you elaborate on that? And if you pull back, does that mean in the second quarter, the RWA capital that was allocated would decline, meaning the -- all other things being equal, your CET1 ratio could bump up a little bit.\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, it's Eric. That's the -- those are the kinds of scenarios and I'll say, navigation that we do for our capital ratios, and they are sometimes dependent on market opportunities, whether it's the FX trading desk here in the U.S. or abroad, whether it's the sec finance unit or sometimes even the lending unit, there -- we're in close partnership with them around on one hand, they are a sophisticated operating within their limits and sometimes they come by, and we have real I think, constructive commercial discussions about, hey, if there's a little more capacity at the top of the house, can that be put to use? And that's where we were this quarter. And you saw we had quite a nice uptick in FX trading revenues up 20% quarter-on-quarter, which I think had not been anticipated was facilitated as we gave them larger limits, partly because we're sitting on an abundance of capital right now.  I think what you will see is that we'll do that selectively. We'll probably do that for another couple of months. We'll see how we're feeling towards June. We would like to keep our RWA asset levels at or below where we are today. So we do expect them to be within those boundaries. And so we'll selectively work through it. But part of the discipline here is we also want to make sure that there's real incremental revenues that we can bring to bear if we're going to deploy the incremental capital and that was the scenario this quarter.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Very helpful. And then, Eric, I know it's not a giant number, but you touched on it in the outlook regarding the adjustments and the fair value adjustments to equity investments were up so strong in Q1 -- in Q1 versus both the fourth quarter and the year ago quarter. How big of a portfolio is that? And was it private equity investments? Can you maybe give us a little more color there?\nRonald O’Hanley: Sure, Gerard. These are primarily or primarily almost exclusively minority investment opportunities and investments that we've made in a series of companies over the years. There's 5 to 10 of them that are in the crypto space, sometimes providing software, sometimes providing infrastructure, sometimes providing different capabilities. There are some in the more classic technology areas where we've invested over time, again, in minority positions that help facilitate some AI capabilities and capacities that have helped us with our automation and engineering efforts, and so there's a group of them. But we're primarily -- we're not trying to build an investment portfolio. What we have is investments, typically of $5 million, $10 million, maybe $15 million in early to mid-stage companies. Oftentimes, they are companies that are providing a utility type service for multiple large banks.  So we're in there with sometimes the other G-SIBs or an international bank or what have you. And so we get -- effectively -- they get -- the entity gets a network effect for multiple banks, and we participate because we get upside in some of the services. So we're doing it to help facilitate primarily either revenue growth, automation capability or just general capabilities to build up our product set. And the -- I guess, the knock-on benefit of that is because we know this market space well. These tend to appreciate over time. And it's one of the ways we've been driving, I think, innovation would probably be the broader word to use. And we've made some -- I think this particular quarter, we saw a couple of these really appreciate, which is good to see.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJames Mitchell: Just, Eric, any -- you updated the guidance on NII for the full year. Any change to the expense or fee revenue guidance that you gave in the prior quarter for the full year?\nEric Aboaf: Jim, I didn't go that far, partly because the market environment has just been volatile whether it's equity markets, whether it's rate hikes. And so there's a number of drivers that are moving around. I think NII, we felt just because the Fed forecast were so explicit between the dot plot and the new consensus that we should just describe that for all of you. But the other lines, we think it's still early to go through. It's still early to really call what the equity markets will do, both in the U.S. and internationally, where they've been more depressed. We'll obviously navigate and adjust our expenses to some extent as we go through the year. I think what we did do as part of the outlook commentary after I finish the quarterly description was a firm that we're committed to both positive total operating leverage and positive fee operating leverage. And so I think that gives you some boundaries that we're working within.\nJames Mitchell: Right. Maybe just one curious question on Series Finance. I appreciate the balances are down, specials are down, and those are important factors. But I've always thought that spreads on sec lending were kind of the spread between -- you benefited from a steepening at the short end of the curve. I didn't really seem to see any of that benefit in the spreads. Is that to come? Or we just not thinking about that right? How should I think about security lending spreads, excluding specials and volume?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. I think directionally, you're right, it tends to have some correlation. And I think what we find though is that the special activity and the mix of -- the underlying mix of assets that are being borrowed or lent tend to be a little more dominant in terms of their effects on the P&L in a given quarter. So it's -- that has a piece to the rate environment, but it tends to be the volumes and the mix that dominates.\nOperator: Next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Maybe just taking a step back for a second. And when you sort of think through the capital mitigating factors and the steps you guys have taken to sort of the capital position here ahead of BBH closing. When you think on a multiyear basis and maybe sort of lessons learned from the move in interest rates and effect that had on your guidance capital position this quarter and maybe after. What is the more appropriate mix of kind of cash, securities and loans for us to think about over time as well as just the duration of the securities portfolio? How much of that will look different perhaps as we look forward?\nRonald O’Hanley: Eric?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, Alex, it's a good question in a way we've not been in this environment for 20 or 30 years, right, where rates either are going to move quickly to the upside or maybe move quickly to the upside and stay high either. I think there are a couple of thoughts that we've developed over time. I think the first is that the more we can add lending assets, classic loans to our balance sheet, they have to be high quality, but the more we can add lending to the mix of the asset side of the balance sheet, the better off we are. And you've seen us -- you've seen us consistently grow our lending book 10%, 12%. It's just -- it's off of a small base. So that's an area we'll continue to evolve in. I think given that, that will though take some time.  The other elements here is what kind of investment portfolio do you run? We -- just because of our trust and custody heritage, believe it should be a high-quality, pristine one that is unassailable. And our perspective as we do that is I think we're more comfortable putting more of that over time into HTM just because it's an accounting convention that while you all can read through in our 10-Ks and Qs, what the underlying market doesn't immediately -- or doesn't affect the capital ratios. The one governor on that, and you'd say, well, why not put it all in HTM and put it in the drawer, is that in a down rate environment, which typically happens when the Fed moves into intervene on a recession, you tend to get an appreciation of securities, and you want to be able to monetize or take advantage of that to offset whether it's credit or reserve builds. And so that's one of the reasons why you don't want to put all of it in HTM.  And the other reason is, if you're -- if rates are flattish or moving within a band of 25 basis points here, 50 basis points there. The AFS convention allows you to rebalance, to adjust your position a little shorter, a little longer. And that's beneficial. And I think over time, we found that that's been additive to our NII and P&L. And so I think over time, you'll probably see us put more in HTM, but not -- there are some limits to that. But that's some of the ways we're thinking about it. And then I guess there's a last layer, which is what's the composition. And I think you've seen us adjust the mix of treasuries, MBS, CMOs. Because we're such a global bank, the foreign sovereigns, especially as euro and international rates rise, I think we'll over time become a bigger part of what we do to grow. So there's a bit of, I think, the mix, the composition will evolve as well over time.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. All right. That's helpful. And then maybe a little bit more of a tactical near-term question. When we look through the NII guide, just extrapolating the full year from the second quarter, I guess how surprisingly the benefits of subsequent rate hikes seem to have a smaller effect on NII. But curious how you guys are thinking about deposit beta assumptions beyond sort of the first 100 basis points. Maybe looking at the U.K. market as kind of lessons learned there a little bit further ahead of us, I guess, on the hike in terms of both pricing and client behavior.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. I think the first 100 basis points, I think, are a little bit easier to read to your point, like the first rate hike, the beta as we generally assume are in the 20% range. So that's the first 1 or 2. So that's comfortable and pleasing, I guess, I should say. Once you get to the third and fourth you're now floating up in betas in the 30% to 45% range, and this is where it kind of depends. And then I think once you get past the first 4 or 5 hikes, you are looking at sequential quarter betas in the 60% range. I think you're just -- that's just what happens. And to be honest, we're -- we want to go back to a position where the NII is healthy. The NII can support the preferred security stack that we should run from a capital perspective, but we also want to be fair and thoughtful with our clients in the embedded sharing that's been a partnership here for decades and decades with them. So that's what we're looking at and thinking.  You never know how the speed of rate hikes affects that. Some of that's been taken into account in some of those guesstimates that's given to you, but I use the word again, guesstimates here, not estimates because we think these cycles aren't perfectly comparable. And some amount of quantitative tightening has been factored into some of our thinking here as well. But that will have an effect.  And then I think the last one that we'll have to see is depending on how the macro economy does, whether it's if the economy -- if rates move up another 100, 200, 300 basis points and the macro economy is strong, then there's a lot of demand for lending. And so there's this big ask between deposits to fund loans. If you have a slowdown in the kind of real economy, then there's not as much lending that's going to be done and that's more beneficial to deposit rates. So that's another feature that we're keeping a close eye on.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So Eric, I was hoping to ask a multipart question on the capital impact of BBH and how that maybe informs the buyback cadence from here. So as we think about the pro forma impact to your capital ratios, if we were to assume the deal closes in the next quarter or 2, and we shut off the buyback through the third quarter. Given the large pro forma capital hit, I believe it's about $3.5 billion from goodwill and deal intangibles, so about 120 bps of Tier 1 leverage. Your ratio exiting 3Q would still shake out below your lower bound of 5.25%, meaningfully below, but somewhere close to 5%. I just wanted to confirm if the $3.5 billion capital drawdown from BBH all in is the right level for us to be contemplating for modeling purposes. And as we think about the buyback cadence, if you're still running at or below that lower band. And how quickly should we be thinking about you getting -- returning to normal course payout target roughly 80%.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. I think the -- it's probably a little bit easier to think about it in CET1 terms. But the translation is kind of the CET1 divided by 2 gives you the leverage. And remember, on leverage, especially in these economic times, we certainly want to stay within the target range of 5.25% to 5.75%. But I've been on record saying getting closer to -- as long as you stay in the 5%, leverage is quite comfortable given that it's not a risk-sensitive measure. If you then pivot back to CET1, we're at almost 12% relative to the target range of 10% to 11%. So there is an almost 200 basis point spread there of excess capital that we have.  If you then fast forward and let's say it's -- we've had a discussion on this call is exactly what we should assume. But if we were to assume a third quarter close, for example, the way to think about it is the goodwill and intangibles for the Brown Brothers transaction is about $3.3 billion. I think if you translate that into CET1, it's just below the 300 basis point mark. So the comparison is, we would prefer, it's not absolutely required, but we prefer to have about 300 basis points of capital to close it. We've got about 200 basis points today. And then the logical way you think about how do you get from here or there over the next 2 quarters, is actually pretty straightforward, right? On one hand, we accrete capital net of the dividend. That's worth about 35 basis points a quarter, so you got 70 there. And on the other hand, as we talked about earlier, we've been deploying our excess capital through the RWA lines, right, through the risk-weighted assets. And we can easily rein in risk-weighted assets by $5 billion or more which creates another 30, 40, 50 basis points of capital as part of a closing process. So there's good levers here, and that's why I said earlier from a capital perspective, it's a comfortable closing process and plan.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Mayo: I just want to make sure I understood what you said on the call. So on the one hand, you're still guiding for positive operating leverage for 2022. You still expect a higher pretax margin. Your backlogs are up. So that's all good. I guess just to clarify your answer just now, the Brown Brothers acquisition all else equal, reduces your CET1 ratio by how much in basis points?\nEric Aboaf: Just shy of just around 300 basis points, Mike.\nMichael Mayo: Okay. And so you're at 11.9% now. So if you close the deal now, you'd be below the low end of your target. So are you delaying the deal because of lack of capital? Or I didn't understand why the delay in the deal.\nEric Aboaf: No, it has nothing to do with capital. If we had been in a position to close it now, we would have arranged -- we would not have deployed $5 billion, maybe even $10 billion of RWA, and we would have had a comfortable close of the deal. It's not about capital. It's about as we described earlier, the underlying regulatory process just taking more time.\nMichael Mayo: Okay. And then as it relates to the lack of resumption of buybacks, is that solely due to the timing of the closing of the deal?\nEric Aboaf: I guess, it's -- we're just factoring it in, right? We're -- because of where we are on the regulatory process, it's -- we're estimating a potential third quarter close and to just navigate comfortably with capital. Because we had that large AOCI hit of $1.3 billion and I usually buy back almost for almost $500 million of shares per quarter, right? That would be my usual cadence that AOCI hit has effectively put us in a position where it's best not to do those 2 quarters worth of buybacks during the second and third quarter.\nMichael Mayo: All right. That's clear. And then lastly, your guidance for positive operating leverage, how much do fee waivers contribute to that? Is that like all of it or 10% or 50% or -- just roughly.\nEric Aboaf: It's -- well, the guidance is to positive total operating leverage and fee operating leverage. I think the -- if I just try to do the math quickly, but the IR team can probably help you offline, Mike. This quarter, we had fee waiver impacts of 10%, and then we won't have any fee waivers for the rest of the year. Last year, we had fee waivers, I can only remember the second half of the year because I'm trying to remember when it started in the $20 million per quarter range. So -- on our total fees of $10 billion, I don't know, rough estimate, maybe about 0.5 point of fee operating leverage is caused by the tailwind absence of money market fee waivers. But that's -- I'm doing mental math without even a pencil and paper in front of me. So maybe we could follow up with you offline, but maybe in that order of magnitude at least.\nMichael Mayo: I think I have. I mean so in terms of ZIP code, most of it does not relate to the fee waivers. There's the lion's share of it. So I think I got it.\nEric Aboaf: That's correct. It's real underlying momentum.\nOperator: And our next question is from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous.\nRobert Wildhack: Just on fee revenue in the quarter, how would you describe about organic growth there?\nRonald O’Hanley: Yes. I mean, Rob, why don't I start, it's Ron. I mean kind of several now good organic growth quarters, both on the servicing line and the management fee line. I think that if you think about last year, there was -- in the servicing line, a fair amount of that would have been in Alpha front to back. A lot of that now is being installed, and a big chunk of that is what you see in the $2.9 trillion. The growth that, or at least the sales that we reported on the servicing fee line were kind of disproportionately in the traditional back office business, which is highly scaled and relatively quick to install. So we like that mix. And then management fees have been, as Eric noted, it's been across the board in the core businesses. It's ETFs, Institutional and even a little bit of Cash. So we like both the level of it. I mean you always like more, but we like the level of it. But as importantly, we like the diversity of it.\nRobert Wildhack: Okay. And then on the $2.9 trillion to be installed, can you just remind us of the timeline for when that gets installed and when it starts to hit revenue?\nEric Aboaf: Sure, Rob. It's Eric. We've said that that begins to get installed this -- remember, the bulk of that, there were 2 very large deals that were announced in second and third quarter last year. Those were $1 trillion-plus deals. And then there's obviously a set of kind of smaller and midsized activities. For those 2 large deals, they are complex and they're transformational, right, for those clients and what we're delivering. And so those we've said take tend to take a little longer. They're closer to the -- I think we've said for installation to installations range from kind of 6 months to 36 months. But for those were the middle ground is probably 24 to 30. So right now, our estimated is that a good piece, but probably not the majority begins to get installed by late this year. And then this is really a 2023 lift of revenue.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back to our CEO, Ron O’Hanley for closing remarks.\nRonald O’Hanley: Well, thanks very much. Thank you all for joining us. I know it was a busy day for you, so we appreciate your time and questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call and webcast. Thank you for participating and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ronald O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the operating environment in the first quarter, which included both significant geopolitical events as well as notable macroeconomic developments and market movements.  Turning to Slide 3 of our presentation. First, I would like to acknowledge the ongoing events in Europe following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In March, I traveled to crack out to visit some of State Street's approximately 6,400 employees in Poland. During my visit, I was moved by the selflessness of our colleagues in Poland, who continue to support displaced Ukrainian people in a number of important ways from opening their own homes and providing shelter to offering professional support, such as interpretation services. While State Street's direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is very small, our teams are responding fluidly to the situation and delivering for our affected clients and other stakeholders with dedication and professionalism in what continues to be a stressful time. We have well-established and regularly tested business continuity plans designed to continue critical services for our clients and support for our people. The first quarter also saw dramatic market movements, driven partially by the conflict in Ukraine, plus a broader set of macroeconomic forces. A tight labor market, rising energy prices, continued supply chain disruptions and the ongoing effects of significant COVID-related fiscal stimulus has contributed to inflation reaching multi-decade highs. As a result, in March, we saw the first interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve since late 2018, a substantial upward move in long-end interest rates as well as volatile currency and equity markets and a stronger U.S. dollar. Each of these factors in part shaped State Street's financial results in the first quarter, which I will now discuss before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail.  Starting with our financial performance. First quarter '22 EPS increased 15% year-over-year and was up 8%, excluding notable items, with earnings growth supported by both higher total fee revenue and stronger net interest income, leading to an improved year-over-year total revenue performance in the first quarter. Within fee revenue, our global markets franchise performed particularly well, driven by higher FX market volatility. And while State Street's revenue performance improved, we also remain highly focused on controlling the expense base. Notwithstanding continued new investments in our business and operational capabilities, first quarter total expenses were flat year-over-year and increased just 1%, excluding notable items, supported by ongoing productivity efforts and the stronger U.S. dollar.  Taken together, we delivered both positive fee and total operating leverage as well as pretax margin expansion, good earnings growth and higher return on equity relative to the year ago period.  Turning to our business momentum, which you can see across the middle of the slide, we recorded another quarter of solid new AUC/A asset servicing wins, which amounted to $302 billion in the first quarter, while AUC/A won but not yet installed amounted to $2.9 trillion at quarter-end. Front office software and data also experienced good business momentum with annual recurring revenue for the first quarter, increasing 15% year-over-year to $235 million.  At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $4.0 trillion at quarter-end. Importantly, we saw another quarter of solid net inflows of $51 billion despite the volatile market environment in the first quarter. Our ETF business continued to perform well as we further focused on innovation and enhancing our ETF product offering. For example, in January, Global Advisors launched 3 new ESG-oriented SPDR ETFs across small-cap international and emerging market equities, aimed at helping investors incorporate ESG considerations into their portfolios. In February, Global Advisors expanded its fixed income offering with the debut of the actively managed SPDR Blackstone high income ETF as we continue to innovate in the active ETF category, which accounted for 13% of U.S. net industry flows in the first quarter.  At State Street Digital, we announced a number of exciting developments. In March, we entered into a licensing agreement with Copper co, a provider of institutional digital asset custody and trading infrastructure. We intend to leverage Copper.co's technology to develop an institutional-grade digital custody offering where clients can store and settle their digital assets within a secure environment operated by State Street.  Turning to capital. Our ratios remained healthy, although CET1 declined quarter-over-quarter, largely due to lower AOCI, driven by the significant moves in interest rates. In the coming quarters, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital ratios.  Regarding BBH, the regulatory review process for the proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business has progressed more slowly than we anticipated. While many required approvals have been obtained, some required regulatory approvals, most notably approval to the relevant federal banking agencies, remain outstanding. We are evaluating potential modifications of the transaction that are intended to facilitate resolution of the bank regulatory review. We are working towards concluding regulatory reviews during the third quarter.  While we are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the relevant federal banking agencies, there can be no assurance of the timing or outcome of their regulatory review. Both parties, State Street and BBH, continue to be excited about the overall financial and strategic opportunities of combining BBH Investor Services with our business. We are continuing to work closely with the BBH team on pre-integration planning. This includes all the preparatory work in product, operations, technology as well as employee communication and client planning. We still expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share in the first quarter -- first year post closing.  To conclude my opening remarks, the first quarter was defined by both unexpected significant geopolitical events and notable macroeconomic and market developments, in the face of which State Street delivered an improved year-over-year financial performance and solid business momentum metrics while supporting our clients and colleagues. As we look ahead in this environment of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and market volatility, we remain laser-focused on delivering what is within our control, including excellence of strategic execution across the front, middle and back office, maintaining the recent improvement in our sales effectiveness and expense discipline all while continuing to provide valuable insights and promote better outcomes for the owners and managers of the world's capital.  And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Thank you, Eric. And operator, we can now open it up to questions. Yes, Glenn, it's Ron. Why don't I take that? I mean I think that if you look back in history, everybody has resisted these moves to some degree because it does involve some spending of money and changing in systems and all that. We've spent a fair amount of time on this and thought about this and have been in conversations with regulators and it will be an added burden, but we don't think it's something the industry can't get done in a reasonable amount of time. So I'm not -- I haven't read other people's comment letters. I know how we've thought about it. So we think it will be one of these things like a LIBOR, if you will, more recent history, that will take a lot of time, take a lot of effort, but it's certainly not something that's going to, in our mind, sideline us or sideline other major players. Sure, Brennan. For the time being, we've seen little movement in deposits other than a little bit of seasonality, a little bit of currency translation has also played through. But this is all within the bounds of what we'd expect. And we've obviously been watching deposits carefully across currency pools and across client segments. And for the time being, it's been flattish, regardless of which way we look at it. As we go forward, we like many others have tried to guesstimate, and I use the word guesstimate not estimate, the level of shift in deposits, movement of deposits that we'll see with the amount of quantitative tightening that the Fed has announced. And I guess the best context I have for you and others is if we go back to the kind of pre-COVID era, we've grown our deposit base since then by $60 billion to $70 billion. We've also increased our AUC/As by about 25% during that time period. And because of those quarterly, we estimate that about half of the increase of $30 billion to $35 billion has come from the quantitative easing as the Fed extended the sedan the other central banks primarily that expanded its balance sheet by effectively $3 trillion.  And so we see that reversing over time with the rough math being for every $1 trillion of balance sheet, we'd expect a $6 billion to $10 billion runoff in our deposits. And they started in May or June, we'll see exactly when they get going at their announced pace. Yes, you could see a little trickle down, we think, in the fourth quarter and then the kind of the $6 billion to $10 billion per year after that.  So that's our guesstimate. We're obviously plus with deposits, and we're happy to be plus with deposits as rates drive. So we'll monetize them for the time being. But that's our guess right now. The other factors are how the interest rate hikes play out. We expect betas to be similar, but they're never exactly the same as they are before. And so we'll be sharply focused there. So those are some of the moving parts in some of our thinking at this point. Yes. They've had a lot going on, Betsy. Maybe I'll focus on that last question first because this is a very client-intensive decision and spending a lot of time on it. I think the single biggest thing clients are asking for is help with the kind of a comprehensive regulatory framework. This is particularly acute in the U.S., the lack of guidance and the lack of -- really an agreed upon framework is has left a lot of uncertainty and see what institutions can do, particularly banks. So that's out there.  I think most of it, though, beyond that, Betsy, would be around and where we're spending a lot of time is, firstly, around enabling clients to invest in digital assets. And that's not just the trading of them, but it's the movement of them. It's the control of them. It's the custody of them, that's a portfolio accounting of them. So it's really, if you think about what we do now for digital assets, tokens, coins, et cetera. I think the other very large thing that the group is focused on, which it's less about external products and much more about how does State Street itself move into a digitalized world more than it is already? And what does it mean for the core operations such as custody, securities movement and control, which is really about, for lack of a better term, the next stage of digitalization. We are working a lot with the major players in the industry because these ecosystems are forming. And in some cases, we actually want to be a very integral part of the ecosystem and in other cases, we actually want to access that. So there's quite a bit going on there. is where I would summarize my answer to you. Yes. I mean, I think where we are now is of adequate scale, but one would expect that more scale will be required. But as much excitement as there is around this, it's still a relatively small proportion of total investment assets. So I think we're at adequate scale. I think the focus now is more on how do we think about additional capabilities growing. Yes. I mean, Brian, the regulatory environment is uncertain, probably gotten more so over the last couple of years been less so, but we are making progress. It is taking longer than we anticipated. We're in dialogue. So it's not like there's -- we're not doing anything or there's silence on all this. We're in a fair amount of dialogue and working the kind of the restructuring that we referred to earlier is explicitly aimed at trying to accelerate this that we view speed is of the essence here. But there's a fair amount of uncertainty. So as I said in my prepared remarks, and Eric just reiterated, what we're targeting at this point and assuming that there'll be a -- this review will get done in the third quarter. And then as Eric noted, the actual -- once the review is done, the close itself isn't going to take a lot of time. I mean everything is ready. The money is in place. There's been a fair amount of integration planning, but it really is around the uncertainty of both the timing and the outcome of these regulatory reviews. And yes, it's mostly -- right now, the open ones are mostly the U.S. banking regulators.  We've received lots of approvals from around the world, both from financial services regulators and the antitrust regulators globally. So I don't want to minimize what has been done. But this is one of those things that may be not done until the last one is done. Sure, Gerard. These are primarily or primarily almost exclusively minority investment opportunities and investments that we've made in a series of companies over the years. There's 5 to 10 of them that are in the crypto space, sometimes providing software, sometimes providing infrastructure, sometimes providing different capabilities. There are some in the more classic technology areas where we've invested over time, again, in minority positions that help facilitate some AI capabilities and capacities that have helped us with our automation and engineering efforts, and so there's a group of them. But we're primarily -- we're not trying to build an investment portfolio. What we have is investments, typically of $5 million, $10 million, maybe $15 million in early to mid-stage companies. Oftentimes, they are companies that are providing a utility type service for multiple large banks.  So we're in there with sometimes the other G-SIBs or an international bank or what have you. And so we get -- effectively -- they get -- the entity gets a network effect for multiple banks, and we participate because we get upside in some of the services. So we're doing it to help facilitate primarily either revenue growth, automation capability or just general capabilities to build up our product set. And the -- I guess, the knock-on benefit of that is because we know this market space well. These tend to appreciate over time. And it's one of the ways we've been driving, I think, innovation would probably be the broader word to use. And we've made some -- I think this particular quarter, we saw a couple of these really appreciate, which is good to see. Eric? Yes. I mean, Rob, why don't I start, it's Ron. I mean kind of several now good organic growth quarters, both on the servicing line and the management fee line. I think that if you think about last year, there was -- in the servicing line, a fair amount of that would have been in Alpha front to back. A lot of that now is being installed, and a big chunk of that is what you see in the $2.9 trillion. The growth that, or at least the sales that we reported on the servicing fee line were kind of disproportionately in the traditional back office business, which is highly scaled and relatively quick to install. So we like that mix. And then management fees have been, as Eric noted, it's been across the board in the core businesses. It's ETFs, Institutional and even a little bit of Cash. So we like both the level of it. I mean you always like more, but we like the level of it. But as importantly, we like the diversity of it. Well, thanks very much. Thank you all for joining us. I know it was a busy day for you, so we appreciate your time and questions. Thank you."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.57 or $1.59 excluding acquisition and restructuring costs. On the left panel of this slide, you can see we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth with strength in many of our businesses, notwithstanding the macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we held total expenses roughly flat year-on-year as we continue to both invest in the franchise and control expenses. As a result, we generated positive operating leverage of about 5 percentage points in the quarter and continue to improve our pretax margin year-over-year. All things considered, this was another strong quarterly performance, demonstrating the progress we are making as we continue to improve our operating model and drive growth.  Turning to Slide 5. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 4% year-on-year and decreased 4% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year change was largely driven by higher period end equity market levels, client flows and net new business growth. The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely the result of lower period end market levels in both equity and bond markets. Similarly, at Global Advisors, AUM increased 12% year-on-year, but declined 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the increase was also driven by higher period end market levels coupled with strong net inflows across all 3 of our franchises, our ETF, institutional and Cash businesses.  The sequential decline was primarily driven by lower market levels, which was partially offset by strong net inflows of $51 billion in the quarter.  Turning to Slide 6. Before I start, I would like to remind you that we are expanding our servicing fee revenue disclosures by disaggregating the line into back-office servicing fees and middle office services. With that, on the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees were flat year-on-year as higher client activity and flows average equity market levels and net new business were offset by normal pricing headwinds and a 2% currency translation headwind.  We continue to see good growth in both our insurance and official institutions client segments. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 1%, primarily as a result of the seasonal pricing headwinds and lower average equity market levels partially offset by strong client activity. Within servicing fees, back office fees were flat both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the factors I just described.  Middle office servicing was down 3% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to a partial transition from a legacy climb and lower professional services fees in the quarter. Notwithstanding the decline in the quarter, middle office is an important component of our Alpha proposition when it comes to both the front office when it connects to both the front and back office, and we expect to see good growth over the medium term. As evidenced by our uninstalled revenue backlog, which I'll talk more about in a moment.  In terms of business momentum, I'm pleased with how 2022 has started. As we report another quarter of solid new AUC/A wins of $302 billion, while AUC/A won 1 but yet to be installed, amounted to $2.9 trillion at quarter end. We continue to be happy with our pipeline, and I'm also particularly pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of strategically important premium and preferred clients.  Turning to Slide 7. First quarter management fees were $520 million, up 5% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and strong ETF inflows. Management fees were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity market headwinds, partially offset by the tailwind of lower fee waivers and net inflows. Of note, our management fee performance for the quarter was supported by strong net inflows of $51 billion with positive inflows across our entire business franchise, Institutional, Cash and ETF.  With respect to money market fee waivers, the fee waiver impact to management fees for the quarter was roughly $10 million, down from about $20 million in the fourth quarter. I would note that following the 25 basis point Fed hike we saw in March of this year, we no longer expect money market fee waivers to be a headwind to management fees starting in April. As you can see on the bottom of the slide, our franchise remains well-positioned for growth. I'm particularly pleased that the strategic actions that we've previously taken in our long-term Institutional and ETF franchises are now helping to draw inflows even in the current volatile market environment.  On Slide 8, you can see that FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the period a year ago, FX trading services revenue was up 4% year-on-year and 20% quarter-on-quarter. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter performance benefited from high FX market volatility while higher client FX volumes also contributed sequentially. Part of the revenue uptick has come from about $5 billion in higher risk-weighted assets we put to work this quarter, which demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility and which I'll come back to in a moment.  Our securities finance revenues decreased 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower average agency assets alone, partially offset by solid new business wins in enhanced custody. Sequentially, revenues were down 6%, mainly reflecting lower average agency and enhanced custody balances due to the declining market levels and fewer specials. First quarter software and processing fees were up 26% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which I'll turn to shortly.  Finally, other fee revenue of $29 million almost doubled year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, mainly reflecting fair value adjustments on equity investments.  Moving to Slide 9. We've provided a breakdown of our consolidated front office software and data revenue on the left. We've broken down the revenue into software categories you have seen us use before, on-premise, professional services and software-enabled revenue. While CRD represents a large majority of this line, Alpha Data Services, Alpha Data Platform and [indiscernible] revenues are also included here as well. As we've highlighted earlier, front office software revenue growth was particularly strong, up 44% year-on-year, primarily driven by on-premise renewals as well as the continued strong growth in software-enabled and professional services revenues.  On the right of the slide, we've provided some key growth metrics enabled by CRD and Alpha. As I mentioned earlier during today's presentation, you'll notice that we've broken out both the front office and middle office uninstalled revenue backlog, both of which are key components of our alpha proposition going forward. The front office backlog of $93 million is up 43% and the middle office backlog has more than tripled year-on-year to $63 million. The backlogs reflect expected annualized revenue, which can be compared to the $900 million of annual revenue base in 2020 across both the front and middle office businesses and is an indicator of future revenue growth once fully installed.  The Alpha pipeline remains promising despite the current geopolitical environment as clients realize the transformational benefits to their technology and operations infrastructure.  Turning to Slide 10. As we see the start of another rate tightening cycle, first quarter NII increased 9% year-on-year, primarily driven by growth in our investment portfolio coupled with higher loan balances, which will also benefit us in future quarters. Relative to the fourth quarter, NII was up 5%, which came in better than expected due to higher long end rates. The sequential increase was largely driven by the improvement in both short and long end rates, which benefited our yields together with higher investment portfolio balances.  On the right of this slide, we show our average balance sheet during the first quarter, which has been relatively steady. Average assets were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower 1Q deposit balances, which are down slightly from the seasonally high fourth quarter, but up year-on-year.  Turning to Slide 11. First quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 1% year-on-year or 2% adjusted for currency translation. Productivity savings and targeted investments remain on try for the first quarter as we generated approximately $90 million in year-on-year growth savings and self-funded most of the strategic investments we've been making in the businesses, including technology infrastructure, broader automation, Alpha and State Street Digital. Compared to first quarter on a line item basis, excluding notable items, compensation and employee benefits was down 1% as lower head count in high-cost locations and the tailwind of currency translation was partially offset by higher seasonal expenses.  Information systems and communication expenses were up 5% due to continued investment in our technology infrastructure and resiliency. Occupancy was down 13% due to footprint optimization and lower maintenance costs and other expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher professional fees.  Relative to the fourth quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal expenses partially offset by productivity and footprint optimization savings. Headcount increased slightly quarter-on-quarter as we began to in-source some technology functions from vendors and growth in Alpha. Overall, we remain focused on delivering positive total and fee operating leverage and have demonstrated that this quarter amidst the current macroeconomic environment.  Moving to Slide 12. We show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio decreased by 2.4 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 11.9% due to both numerator and denominator effects. RWA increased by roughly $15 billion or 160 basis points of CET1 during the first quarter of 2022 compared to year-end, driven by 3 factors: a modest rebound from an unusually low fourth quarter; a strategic and temporary allocation of additional RWA capital to our markets businesses to generate the higher-than-expected first quarter revenues that we just discussed; and lastly, the RWA impact from the SA-CCR implementation that started on January 1 of this year, which we had planned for. At the same time, our capital base was also impacted by the substantial reduction in AOCI of about $1.3 billion, worth 110 basis points of CET1 relative to the fourth quarter as we saw a significant and historic quarter-on-quarter movement in long-end rates, particularly in the belly of the curve.  For instance, the rise in the 5-year U.S. treasury of roughly 120 basis points was the largest in the last 30 years. Taken together, the increase in RWA, coupled with a meaningful reduction in AOCI, partially offset by about 35 basis points of earnings accretion, net of dividends, drove the decrease in our CET1 ratio this quarter.  In contrast, first quarter Tier 1 leverage was down only slightly to 5.9%, mainly driven by the substantial decrease in AOCI, reflecting a significant change in the interest rate environment and a stable balance sheet.  While capital return remains an explicit priority for us, and we recognize its important to our shareholders, given this $1.3 billion move in AOCI related to higher interest rates, we no longer expect to resume our share repurchase program in the second or third quarter as we operate with a conservative balance sheet philosophy.  Given the volatility in rates and the possibility of further significant increases, we are in the process of taking several actions to reduce AOCI risk by about half. This primarily includes shifting additional AFS securities to HTM as well as shortening the portfolio duration through swaps lowering extension risk and consciously allowing some portfolio runoff. Some of these latter actions can be reversed in the future when we choose to reinvest at higher rates.  Turning to Slide 13. We provide a summary of our first quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I'm pleased with our financial performance, which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our businesses. Total fee revenue was up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher management fees, FX trading, software and processing fees and other fee revenues. Expenses were well-controlled and were held roughly flat year-on-year, demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model.  Next, I would like to provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter outlook and some of our economic assumptions as we look out over the year. At a macro level, while we know that rate assumptions have been moving, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests a year-end Fed funds rate of 2.5%. In terms of second quarter of 2022, we expect overall fee revenue to be down about 2% on a sequential basis, with servicing fees up about 1% and management fees up 2% to 3%, assuming equity markets remain flat to March 31 levels for 2Q and some downward normalization in FX trading revenues.  In terms of some of our newer fee revenue line items that we started to disclose this quarter, we would not expect to see a repeat of the size of on-premise renewals in the front office software line nor the positive equity investment markups in the other revenue line in 2Q.  Regarding NIIs, we now expect 2Q NII to increase 7% to 9% sequentially, which will be driven by the expected Fed rate hikes, partially offset by the AOCI mitigating portfolio actions that I outlined earlier. For full year 2022, we now expect to see year-on-year NII growth of around 18% to 20% and depending on Fed actions and rate moves as well as the shape of our portfolio.  Turning to expenses. We remain laser-focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs. We expect that second quarter expenses ex-notable items will be up around 2% to 3% on a sequential quarter basis, excluding notable items and seasonal compensation of expenses of $208 million.  On taxes, we expect that the 2Q '22 tax rate will be around 20%. We continue to expect to deliver on our goals of margin expansion and positive total and fee operating leverage for the year.  And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ken, it's Eric. No, capital from a capital perspective, we're quite comfortable with closing. We've got almost 12% capital ratios today. We've got a very, I think, smooth path to being prepared for a close from a capital perspective. The modifications we're talking about are just around the underlying structure of the transaction. And you've seen this done from time to time before. But we're working through legal entity and subsidiary structure, the exact transfer of systems and third-party contracts. Some of the transition servicing agreements, those kind of structure and modifications that we think will make this a cleaner process and be favorable on several fronts. As Ron had said, the regulatory review process has taken a bit longer. We've obviously been heavily engaged in that process because of some of the modifications that we're working through jointly with Brown Brothers leadership team. We're deeply in the process of getting additional and refined submissions in. Those will take several months for review and further dialogue. I think you have a sense for how this plays out. And that's why in the prepared remarks, I think Ron described that we expect those reviews to come through during the third quarter. I think at that point, we obviously then sprint to a close. And depending on exactly what month and what week those come through, then we look for -- you take out the calendar, you look at the weekends and do the usual, how do we now just close, but we've got to always close carefully, just given the usual financials and controls that you want to be mindful of. There's a range of that. I think you've seen us guide to NII up for the quarter of up 7% to 9%. And that on a year-on-year basis is actually going to be quite nice. I think it's -- is it worth a percentage 0.2 or 0.3. It's those kinds of, I think, adjustments that we're willing to make so that we both run an appropriate portfolio in what could be a highly volatile rate environment, including another possibility of rates could move another 50, 100 basis points, and we want to have a portfolio that can withstand that. And to be honest, we're willing to take a few percentage points of NII growth off the table on a sequential basis to do that. So I think it's a balance, but that's the range. And even with some of those adjustments, a lot of what we'll be doing is in the move from AFS to HTM, which is not NII impacting. There are others on the margin that are, but that's kind of the range that I'd share with you. Let me just open up the slide. So I think you're doing it, Brennan, in line with how we've described it. Yes, you can take the first on Slide 11 of the slide deck that $2.318 billion of expenses. That includes the seasonal expenses, which are on the footnote, right, of $208 million, you can pull that out and then you can add 2% to 3% sequentially and get an estimate for second quarter. That's correct. And Betsy -- it's Eric. I was just going to add. The other thing we're doing is, obviously, where clients, especially institutional clients have added crypto holdings within their fund, right? We're effectively providing some of the services you'd expect. And so we've gone through the -- across our client base. They have about 73 funds, I think, at that count with $0.5 billion of crypto exposure, we're effectively record keeping, right, those assets as part of their underlying funds. And then I think more broadly, where clients are developing specific ETFs and exchange-traded products, that's where we are in an industrious way signing them up for the administration and recordkeeping because that, in a way, is our view as one of the next land grabs because as the ETF and ETP products that comes of age, that's where we'll see some significant inflows. Ryan, it's Eric. We've been pleased as we've been monitoring and working closely with Brown Brothers on the business, the business performance. It's -- it had a good finish last year. It's had a performance in the first quarter that's within the bands that we had expected. And obviously, there's a little bit of NII tailwind in there, offset by a little bit of equity market, a downtick. But it's a -- business is performing well. We're -- we continue to be excited about it. And the partners, the 9 partners that have been operating that business that are coming over to us are doing a fine job as we'd expect, which is really, really nice to see.  In terms of the deposits and the close and the assets and the modifications and the broader questions. You're asking about the underlying economics of the transaction. I'm not going to go into detail on that at this point. I think Ron in his prepared remarks affirmed that the economics are sound that they'll be accretive within the first year. And what I'd tell you is, as we work through the modifications, which is oftentimes a legal entity kind of structure where we in the finance and treasury side are working very closely with our legal colleagues to navigate those modifications and make sure that they preserve the economic and the accretion that we're looking for. And so we continue to be positive, and we think it will be positive for shareholders. Gerard, it's Eric. That's the -- those are the kinds of scenarios and I'll say, navigation that we do for our capital ratios, and they are sometimes dependent on market opportunities, whether it's the FX trading desk here in the U.S. or abroad, whether it's the sec finance unit or sometimes even the lending unit, there -- we're in close partnership with them around on one hand, they are a sophisticated operating within their limits and sometimes they come by, and we have real I think, constructive commercial discussions about, hey, if there's a little more capacity at the top of the house, can that be put to use? And that's where we were this quarter. And you saw we had quite a nice uptick in FX trading revenues up 20% quarter-on-quarter, which I think had not been anticipated was facilitated as we gave them larger limits, partly because we're sitting on an abundance of capital right now.  I think what you will see is that we'll do that selectively. We'll probably do that for another couple of months. We'll see how we're feeling towards June. We would like to keep our RWA asset levels at or below where we are today. So we do expect them to be within those boundaries. And so we'll selectively work through it. But part of the discipline here is we also want to make sure that there's real incremental revenues that we can bring to bear if we're going to deploy the incremental capital and that was the scenario this quarter. Jim, I didn't go that far, partly because the market environment has just been volatile whether it's equity markets, whether it's rate hikes. And so there's a number of drivers that are moving around. I think NII, we felt just because the Fed forecast were so explicit between the dot plot and the new consensus that we should just describe that for all of you. But the other lines, we think it's still early to go through. It's still early to really call what the equity markets will do, both in the U.S. and internationally, where they've been more depressed. We'll obviously navigate and adjust our expenses to some extent as we go through the year. I think what we did do as part of the outlook commentary after I finish the quarterly description was a firm that we're committed to both positive total operating leverage and positive fee operating leverage. And so I think that gives you some boundaries that we're working within. Yes. I think directionally, you're right, it tends to have some correlation. And I think what we find though is that the special activity and the mix of -- the underlying mix of assets that are being borrowed or lent tend to be a little more dominant in terms of their effects on the P&L in a given quarter. So it's -- that has a piece to the rate environment, but it tends to be the volumes and the mix that dominates. Yes, Alex, it's a good question in a way we've not been in this environment for 20 or 30 years, right, where rates either are going to move quickly to the upside or maybe move quickly to the upside and stay high either. I think there are a couple of thoughts that we've developed over time. I think the first is that the more we can add lending assets, classic loans to our balance sheet, they have to be high quality, but the more we can add lending to the mix of the asset side of the balance sheet, the better off we are. And you've seen us -- you've seen us consistently grow our lending book 10%, 12%. It's just -- it's off of a small base. So that's an area we'll continue to evolve in. I think given that, that will though take some time.  The other elements here is what kind of investment portfolio do you run? We -- just because of our trust and custody heritage, believe it should be a high-quality, pristine one that is unassailable. And our perspective as we do that is I think we're more comfortable putting more of that over time into HTM just because it's an accounting convention that while you all can read through in our 10-Ks and Qs, what the underlying market doesn't immediately -- or doesn't affect the capital ratios. The one governor on that, and you'd say, well, why not put it all in HTM and put it in the drawer, is that in a down rate environment, which typically happens when the Fed moves into intervene on a recession, you tend to get an appreciation of securities, and you want to be able to monetize or take advantage of that to offset whether it's credit or reserve builds. And so that's one of the reasons why you don't want to put all of it in HTM.  And the other reason is, if you're -- if rates are flattish or moving within a band of 25 basis points here, 50 basis points there. The AFS convention allows you to rebalance, to adjust your position a little shorter, a little longer. And that's beneficial. And I think over time, we found that that's been additive to our NII and P&L. And so I think over time, you'll probably see us put more in HTM, but not -- there are some limits to that. But that's some of the ways we're thinking about it. And then I guess there's a last layer, which is what's the composition. And I think you've seen us adjust the mix of treasuries, MBS, CMOs. Because we're such a global bank, the foreign sovereigns, especially as euro and international rates rise, I think we'll over time become a bigger part of what we do to grow. So there's a bit of, I think, the mix, the composition will evolve as well over time. Yes. I think the first 100 basis points, I think, are a little bit easier to read to your point, like the first rate hike, the beta as we generally assume are in the 20% range. So that's the first 1 or 2. So that's comfortable and pleasing, I guess, I should say. Once you get to the third and fourth you're now floating up in betas in the 30% to 45% range, and this is where it kind of depends. And then I think once you get past the first 4 or 5 hikes, you are looking at sequential quarter betas in the 60% range. I think you're just -- that's just what happens. And to be honest, we're -- we want to go back to a position where the NII is healthy. The NII can support the preferred security stack that we should run from a capital perspective, but we also want to be fair and thoughtful with our clients in the embedded sharing that's been a partnership here for decades and decades with them. So that's what we're looking at and thinking.  You never know how the speed of rate hikes affects that. Some of that's been taken into account in some of those guesstimates that's given to you, but I use the word again, guesstimates here, not estimates because we think these cycles aren't perfectly comparable. And some amount of quantitative tightening has been factored into some of our thinking here as well. But that will have an effect.  And then I think the last one that we'll have to see is depending on how the macro economy does, whether it's if the economy -- if rates move up another 100, 200, 300 basis points and the macro economy is strong, then there's a lot of demand for lending. And so there's this big ask between deposits to fund loans. If you have a slowdown in the kind of real economy, then there's not as much lending that's going to be done and that's more beneficial to deposit rates. So that's another feature that we're keeping a close eye on. Yes. I think the -- it's probably a little bit easier to think about it in CET1 terms. But the translation is kind of the CET1 divided by 2 gives you the leverage. And remember, on leverage, especially in these economic times, we certainly want to stay within the target range of 5.25% to 5.75%. But I've been on record saying getting closer to -- as long as you stay in the 5%, leverage is quite comfortable given that it's not a risk-sensitive measure. If you then pivot back to CET1, we're at almost 12% relative to the target range of 10% to 11%. So there is an almost 200 basis point spread there of excess capital that we have.  If you then fast forward and let's say it's -- we've had a discussion on this call is exactly what we should assume. But if we were to assume a third quarter close, for example, the way to think about it is the goodwill and intangibles for the Brown Brothers transaction is about $3.3 billion. I think if you translate that into CET1, it's just below the 300 basis point mark. So the comparison is, we would prefer, it's not absolutely required, but we prefer to have about 300 basis points of capital to close it. We've got about 200 basis points today. And then the logical way you think about how do you get from here or there over the next 2 quarters, is actually pretty straightforward, right? On one hand, we accrete capital net of the dividend. That's worth about 35 basis points a quarter, so you got 70 there. And on the other hand, as we talked about earlier, we've been deploying our excess capital through the RWA lines, right, through the risk-weighted assets. And we can easily rein in risk-weighted assets by $5 billion or more which creates another 30, 40, 50 basis points of capital as part of a closing process. So there's good levers here, and that's why I said earlier from a capital perspective, it's a comfortable closing process and plan. Just shy of just around 300 basis points, Mike. No, it has nothing to do with capital. If we had been in a position to close it now, we would have arranged -- we would not have deployed $5 billion, maybe even $10 billion of RWA, and we would have had a comfortable close of the deal. It's not about capital. It's about as we described earlier, the underlying regulatory process just taking more time. I guess, it's -- we're just factoring it in, right? We're -- because of where we are on the regulatory process, it's -- we're estimating a potential third quarter close and to just navigate comfortably with capital. Because we had that large AOCI hit of $1.3 billion and I usually buy back almost for almost $500 million of shares per quarter, right? That would be my usual cadence that AOCI hit has effectively put us in a position where it's best not to do those 2 quarters worth of buybacks during the second and third quarter. It's -- well, the guidance is to positive total operating leverage and fee operating leverage. I think the -- if I just try to do the math quickly, but the IR team can probably help you offline, Mike. This quarter, we had fee waiver impacts of 10%, and then we won't have any fee waivers for the rest of the year. Last year, we had fee waivers, I can only remember the second half of the year because I'm trying to remember when it started in the $20 million per quarter range. So -- on our total fees of $10 billion, I don't know, rough estimate, maybe about 0.5 point of fee operating leverage is caused by the tailwind absence of money market fee waivers. But that's -- I'm doing mental math without even a pencil and paper in front of me. So maybe we could follow up with you offline, but maybe in that order of magnitude at least. That's correct. It's real underlying momentum. Sure, Rob. It's Eric. We've said that that begins to get installed this -- remember, the bulk of that, there were 2 very large deals that were announced in second and third quarter last year. Those were $1 trillion-plus deals. And then there's obviously a set of kind of smaller and midsized activities. For those 2 large deals, they are complex and they're transformational, right, for those clients and what we're delivering. And so those we've said take tend to take a little longer. They're closer to the -- I think we've said for installation to installations range from kind of 6 months to 36 months. But for those were the middle ground is probably 24 to 30. So right now, our estimated is that a good piece, but probably not the majority begins to get installed by late this year. And then this is really a 2023 lift of revenue."

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change.  Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As I reflect on 2023, the operating environment was dynamic with a complex set of challenges for the world's investors and for our industry, and I am proud of how we carefully navigated State Street through various headwinds, while continuing to execute against our strategic agenda. We focused and delivered on that agenda in three key areas; achieve strong sales wins across our businesses, drive strategic change in our investment services business and remain disciplined on productivity and broader cost management. Further on that last point, during 2023, we implemented key productivity actions and announced additional efficiency measures that will enable us to enhance the productivity of our operating model in 2024 and the years ahead. We took these many actions all while investing in our business and returning substantial capital to our shareholders, which helped to drive full year earnings growth excluding notable items. The world's investors, State Street and our industry, faced a host of significant market events and macroeconomic forces in 2023. In the first quarter, turmoil in the banking sector ultimately led to the resolution from several banks, which was a catalyst for some of the largest fixed income market moves seen in decades. In the second quarter, anticipation grew about the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence, helping to drive equity markets higher. However, as we progress into the third quarter and as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to the highest level in 2022 years in July, the prospect of higher for longer rates led to a substantial sell off in bond markets with the US 10-year treasury yield exceeding 5% in October, for the first time since the global financial crisis. Rate uncertainty and an increasing number of geopolitical concerns caused equities to struggle. Then during the fourth quarter, the equity market rallied vigorously as inflation receded and investors grew increasingly optimistic about a soft landing with positive sentiment gaining further momentum in the last month as the Federal Reserve signaled a pivot to lower interest rates this year. In sum, while our full year overall financial results benefited from higher interest rates globally last year and despite the strong market appreciation in the fourth quarter, daily average global equity markets only increased by low single digits in 2023, providing just a modest tailwind to our fee revenue, while client activity was muted as investors stayed on the sidelines for much of the year. And even in such an eventful year, equity and FX market volatility continued to contract creating revenue headwinds for our trading businesses. Slide 3 of our investor presentation provides some of our highlights for the year. Beginning with our financial performance, full year earnings per share was 5.58 or 7.66 excluding notable items. Year-over-year, excluding notable items, EPS growth was supported by $3.8 billion of common share repurchases, a record level of NII, continued growth of our front office software and data business and higher securities finance revenues. The combination of which more than offset the impact of lower servicing and management fees and underlying expense growth, which was still well controlled. We continued to build business momentum and position State Street for longer term success. To that end, we achieved a number of important accomplishments in 2023, as you can see on Slide 3. A key highlight of today's results is the clear progress we're making on innovation and advancing product capabilities, which in turn contributes to stronger sales momentum across our broad franchise aimed at generating better fee revenue growth in the year ahead. Within the Investment Services business, we are intensely focused on ensuring better execution against our strategy and revenue goals. We unveiled the sharpened execution plan last year, underpinned by a number of measurable actions aimed at driving servicing opportunities across key regions and product areas, realizing the full potential of our Alpha value proposition and accelerating sales and revenue growth, particularly in our core back office custody. Encouragingly, as I just noted, today's results demonstrate our proven ability to deliver the level of sales required for attractive organic servicing fee revenue growth for the future as we built upon the $91 million of new servicing fee sales in third quarter by recording $103 million of new servicing fee wins in 4Q, which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in recent years. From its inception, we have noted that Alpha will further establish, broaden and deepen client relationships, positioning State Street as our client's essential partner. Alpha distinctively enables us to grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's capability as a true one State Street solution for our clients from front to back. 2023 was an important year for Alpha software delivery. Last two quarters of the year included the significant development of the fixed income portfolio management module, which propel CRD and Alpha capabilities and competitiveness forward. In 3Q, we recorded our first Alpha for private markets client. And in the fourth quarter, we continued Alpha's momentum by deepening relationships with a number of key existing mandates and recording four new Alpha wins, while our front office software and data business had a record quarter of new bookings in 4Q, both demonstrating our ability to drive stronger sales. Within our Global Markets business, even as low volatility created a headwind, we continued to see proof points of our very strong market position. For example, in its 2023 FX awards, Euromoney Magazine named State Street as the winner across four important categories, including the best FX bank for real money clients. We also continued to innovate and strategically expand our product capabilities and geographic reach, including the planned acquisition of outsourced trading firm CF Global Trading. At Global Advisors, we undertook targeted strategic actions aimed at gaining market share and driving occupancy growth in the coming years. As a result, we saw encouraging business momentum with GA setting a number of growth records in 2023. A number of key performance indicators make us optimistic as we look ahead. For example, in Q4, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate total flows, including record quarterly flows within our SPDR ETF franchise, amounting to a capture of 21% of total global ETF flows in Q4 and ending 2023 with a record level of total ETF assets under management. Our cash business had an exceptional year delivering record annual flows in 2023 with institutional money market fund AUM also reaching a record. Overall, we gained market share in a number of key areas, including institutional money market funds and US low cost equity and fixed income ETFs. Turning to our efficiency and productivity efforts. Underlying expense growth was well controlled in 2023 with full year expenses increasing 3%, excluding notable items. Q4 expenses, excluding notable items, rose just 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of our ongoing expense actions. Transforming our operations to improve effectiveness and efficiency and realize productivity growth remains a key priority for us. To that end, we announced important steps in our multiyear productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model. As we previously announced, we are streamlining our operations in India. We have now assumed control of one of our joint ventures in that country with a second joint venture consolidation expected to close in spring. We expect these actions will accelerate the transformation of State Street's global operations, improve service quality and client experience and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive free operating leverage in 2024. Turning to Slide 4 of our presentation. You can see our fourth quarter financial highlights and business trends and indicators, which Eric will shortly take you through in more detail. Before I conclude my opening remarks, I would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength, which has enabled us to return substantial amount of excess capital in recent quarters. For example, over the last five quarters to the end of December, we have returned $6.4 billion of capital to our shareholders. As we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return, in 2024, it is currently our intention to return approximately 100% of earnings in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions. Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common share purchase program of up to $5 billion with no set expiration date. To conclude, while 2023 was an eventful year, we finished strongly in 4Q, which creates an encouraging starting point for our businesses into 2024. This year, we remain highly focused on both the execution of our strategy and the accountability for results. Our goals are clear. We must continue the improvement in our sales performance that we demonstrated in the second half of 2023, continue to implement a set of productivity initiatives and product enhancements that will drive longer term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024, all while returning capital to our shareholders. We are laser focused on these goals. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, let me briefly discuss the notable items we recognized in the quarter on Slide 5, which collectively totaled $620 million pretax or $1.49 of EPS. First, we recognized an FDIC special assessment of $387 million, which is reflected in other expenses. Second, we recognized $203 million of net repositioning charges to enable the next phase of our productivity program. As we had indicated in December, the bulk of this action primarily relates to severance of around 1,500 employees. Our initiative to streamline and delayer our operations, technology and staff functions and improve efficiency will allow us to sustainably reduce expenses. We expect these actions collectively to have a payback of roughly six quarters and begin this quarter with roughly two-thirds of the benefit occurring in 2024. These actions and the related savings will contribute to our fee operating leverage goal for 2024 and in subsequent years. Turning to Slide 6. I will begin my review of both our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As you can see on the table, total fee revenue was flattish for all periods of comparison quarter-on-quarter, the year-on-year quarter and for the full year. The slight market appreciation, notwithstanding the combination of muted volatility, central bank pivot and geopolitical concerns, pushed investors to the sidelines for much of the year. In terms of our more durable revenues, we continue to benefit from strong momentum in our front office software and data business, which was up 5% on a full year basis and 13% on the year-on-year quarter. In terms of areas that have begun to rebound, management fee performance was down for the full year at minus 3%, but has begun to rebound with an up 5% result for the year-on-year quarter as flows picked up and we gained share. Back office servicing fees was challenged for much of the year as the client's transactional activity was muted but has started to turn positive and is up 1% this quarter as we've seen a recent lift in equity markets. And of course, we continue to be affected by industry wide headwinds in our global markets businesses, given the low levels of volatility in the FX markets and specials activity in agency lending throughout the year. NII has been tough to predict and surprise to the part of this quarter compared to third quarter. I'll turn to that in a few minutes. Expenses were well controlled in the quarter as we continue to thoughtfully allocate resources across the franchise and to areas where we see the greatest opportunities for top line growth. Relative to the year ago, total expenses ex-notables were up 2% year-on-year and reflect intensifying cost management in a tough environment as the year progressed. This expense control, coupled with the repositioning actions I just mentioned, prepare us to deliver productivity savings and positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Finally, despite a dynamic and challenging operating environment, we delivered full year 2023 EPS growth of 3% excluding notable items. This was supported by share repurchases, a record level of NII and the growth for our front office software and data business, which is less exposed to macroeconomic conditions. Turning now to Slide 7. We saw period end AUC/A increase by 14% on a year-on-year basis and 4% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end market levels and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased primarily due to higher period end market levels. At Global Advisors, period end AUM increased 19% year-on-year and was up 12% sequentially, largely reflecting higher period end market levels and strong net inflows. Notably, as Ron mentioned earlier and I'll describe momentarily, in fourth quarter, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate net flows of $103 billion, which sets us up well for 2024. At the center right, we've also added a table of market volatility indices, which we believe can be useful indicators of client transactional activity that drives servicing fees, specials activity in agency lending and flows in margins and FX trading. On Slide 8 now. On the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average equity markets, partially offset by pricing headwinds, lower client activity and adjustments and a previously disclosed client transition. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 2%, primarily as a result of the pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed net client transition, partially offset by higher client activity and adjustments, which was nice to see as clients started to come off the sidelines. On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. We were quite pleased to see new servicing fee revenue wins of $103 million this quarter, the highest in many recent years, primarily reflecting the enhancements to our sales processes and product offerings, including in North America where we saw strong outcomes after a period of underperformance. These servicing wins contributed to the total full year fee revenue wins of $301 million and underscores the progress we're making towards stronger sales performance. Recall, our goal for 2024 is even higher at $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee sales for the year. Finally, we had $270 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end, up $57 million year-on-year and $15 million quarter-on-quarter. We expect about half of this to install in 2024. We also had $2.3 trillion of AUC/A to be installed at period end. Turning to Slide 9. Fourth quarter management fees were $479 million, up 5% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and some performance fees, partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impact of a strategic product suite repricing initiative that has aided ETF flows. Relative to the third quarter, management fees were flat, mainly driven by higher performance fees, offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impacts of the strategic ETF product suite repricing initiatives. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broad based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETF, we had record quarterly net inflows of $68 billion, driven by record net inflows into SPY as well as the SPDR portfolio US low cost suite experiencing consistent market share gains. In our institutional business, we saw quarterly net flows of $6 billion, primarily driven by defined contribution products. And lastly, across our cash franchise, we saw quarterly cash net inflows of $29 billion, primarily into money market funds, which contributed to the record total full year 2023 cash net inflows of $76 billion and institutional money market fund market share gains. Turning now to Slide 10. Fourth quarter FX trading services revenue was down 11% year-on-year ex-notables and 2% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower FX spreads from muted market volatility offset by slightly higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the decrease primarily reflects lower direct FX revenues from muted volatility. Fourth quarter securities finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower agency balances, partially offset by higher agency spreads, higher specials activity and prime services revenue. Moving on to software and processing revenues. Fourth quarter fees were up 10% year-on-year and 26% sequentially, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Finally, other fee revenue for the quarter increased $15 million year-on-year, primarily due to a midyear tax credit investment accounting change, partially offset by the impact associated with the devaluation of the Argentinian peso. Moving to Slide 11. You'll see on the left panel that fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased 13% year-on-year, primarily as a result of the continued SaaS implementations and conversion, driving software enabled and professional services revenue growth. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was up 38%, primarily driven by higher on premise renewals and go live implementations. Turning to some of the Alpha business metrics on the right panel. We’re pleased to report four more Alpha mandate wins in the quarter, which means seven wins for the full year 2023. State Street Alpha continues to be an important differentiator of our business and creates an attractive value proposition for our clients with contractual terms usually covering five to seven, to 10 years. We’ve also gone live with three more Alpha clients which brings us to six for the year, which sets us up well for 2024, and added significant new functionality for fixed income portfolio managers. Fourth quarter ARR increased 16% year-over-year, driven by 20 plus SaaS client implementations and conversions, and we had a record quarter for front office new bookings at $32 million. Turning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII increased 14% year-on-year but increased 9% sequentially to $678 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to lower average deposit balances and deposit mix shift, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by the impact of interest rates and the full quarter impact of the third quarter investment portfolio repositioning, as well as higher deposits and loan balances. The NII results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected, as both interest bearing and non-interest bearing deposits increased and certain client repricings were further delayed. Some of the higher deposit balances may have been seasonal but the Fed's quantitative tightening appears to have been offset by the reduction of the Fed's Reverse repo operation, which seems to have resulted in clients leaving higher bank deposit balances. It's hard to know how deposits will trend but we are pleased with this higher step-off going into the first quarter of 2024. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during fourth quarter. Average deposits increased 4% quarter-on-quarter with non-interest bearing deposits up 3% for the quarter. Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 2% year-on-year or 1% ex-FX. Sequentially, fourth quarter expenses were up only 1% as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, Private Markets, Core Custody and tech and ops process improvements and automation. On a line-by-line basis and year-over-year, ex-notables, compensation employee benefits increased 1%, primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by lower contractor spend and performance based incentive comp. Information systems and communications expenses increased 4%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and vendor credits. Transaction processing increased 1%, mainly reflecting higher brokerage costs. Occupancy increased 24%, largely due to the absence of an episodic sale leaseback transaction in the prior period. And other expenses were up 3% sequentially, flat year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher marketing spend and professional fees. Lastly, let me spend a moment on headcount. As we discussed in the third quarter, as part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we have streamlined our operating model in India and have now assumed full ownership of one of our operations joint ventures, and we recently announced that we intend a similar undertaking with a second consolidation in the country this spring. This consolidation continues the transformation of State Street's global operations and will enable us to unlock productivity savings, which we expect to start this quarter through a reduction in contractor services and in the years ahead as we simplify our fragmented operating model. As you would expect, consolidating the first joint venture increased our FTE headcount roughly 4,400 in the quarter as we in sourced global capabilities. However, these costs were already in our expense base and reported historically under the comp and benefits line. These actions are contributing to our higher productivity savings targets for 2024. Moving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels, which came in above both our internal targets and our regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.6% was up 60 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by episodically lower RWA and improvement in AOCI, partially offset by the continuation of common share repurchases. The decrease in interest rates during December after the completion of our buyback contributed about 20 basis points to our CET1 ratios. And some market factors over the last week of December conveniently contributed roughly another 50 basis points to the RWA end of period print. Going forward, I would expect RWA to run at higher levels to support our various businesses. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 106% and 122% for State Street Bank & Trust. In the quarter, we were quite pleased to return over $700 million to shareholders, consisting of $500 million of common share repurchases over $200 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as we announced earlier today, our Board authorized a new multiyear common equity repurchase program of up to $5 billion with no expiration date. Turning to Slide 15. Before I start, let me first share some of the assumptions and underlying our current views for the full year. Let me cover our full year 2024 outlook, as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have more potential for variability than usual given the macroeconomic environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect global equity markets to be flat point to point in 2024, which equates to the daily average being up about 10% year-over-year. Our interest rate outlook for 2024 largely aligns with the forward curve as of year end 2023, which I would note continues to move. We expect to see modest increase in FX and equity volatility, which should support slightly higher FX trading services fees this year, but we are still seeing muted volatility in the first quarter. And we expect currency translation to have less than 0.5 percentage point impact on revenues and expenses due to dollar depreciation. And I would remind you that a weaker US dollar has a favorable impact on revenues and an unfavorable impact on expenses. So we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be up approximately 3% to 4% ex-notable items with servicing fee and management fee growth driven by higher market levels and continued business momentum and continued strong growth in front office software and data. This includes a headwind of a little less than 1 percentage point to fee growth from the expected previously disclosed client transition. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, we currently expect fee revenue to be up 2% on a year-over-year basis with servicing fees expected to be up 1%, management fees up 7% to 8% and front office software and data expected to be up over 20%, largely due to increased SaaS new business and conversions and on-premise renewals. We expect full year 2024 NII to be down about 10% on a year-over-year basis compared to a record 2023. This is dependent on the outcome of global rate cuts and deposit mix and levels, which are obviously difficult to predict. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, after a significant step up in 4Q '23, we expect 1Q '24 NII to be flat to down 3% on a sequential quarter basis given current deposit mix expectations. Turning to expenses. As you can see on the walk on Page 16, we expect full year expenses ex-notables will be up about 2.5% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven largely by our continued investment in the business, which we expect to largely offset through greater productivity savings worth $0.5 billion, which is approximately 1.7 times last year's gross savings level. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be up 1% to 1.5% on a year-over-year basis, keeping in mind that seasonal expenses usually occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, we expect to achieve positive fee operating leverage, excluding notable items for full year 2024, given the projected growth in fee revenue and well controlled expenses. Finally, we expect taxes should be in the 21% to 22% range for 2024. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: I was hoping we could start with unpacking some of the NII dynamics, and I guess appreciate the uncertainty when it comes to deposits. But Eric, maybe talk a little bit about what drove the upside in the fourth quarter in deposit levels, and if you have a view on what sort of seasonal versus more kind of core client franchise driven? And maybe give us some insight on where you expect balances to ultimately stabilize in the back half of the '24?\nEric Aboaf: Let me share with you the texture we have. But I'll just say deposits and deposit levels continue to be volatile, they surprise to the upside. And in particular, we saw a nice uptick in deposits into September, October, we actually saw, on the NIB side, a downtick in November and then a large uptick again in December. So the averages came in up for the quarter, which made a big difference. $1 billion of NIB for a month is worth $5 million and you kind of multiply through and that quickly adds up as we had a spread in December of $5 billion, $6 billion relative to our expectations. And at the same time, we also saw interest bearing deposits up. Now some of that is just our regular way engagement with clients, some of that is there leaving more deposits with us. And I think you did see, in the Fed reports, the banking system deposits are up 1%, 2% quarter-on-quarter from third quarter to fourth quarter. So it does seem like there's something happening in the market that's creating a little more stability, a little bit of buoyancy. There's some amount of seasonality that we always tend to see at the end of the year as folks accumulate cash, sometimes to pay dividends and ETFs in the next year. So it's just hard to read but that's what played out. And it played out better through the quarter and through the end. If I then try to look forward, it's very hard to look forward for the year. And we'd like to operate and expect to operate in the deposit range of $200 billion to $210 billion, that's our kind of goal. A lot of that is just client engagement and helping put their cash to work. And sometimes they put cash to work in deposits, in repo, in money market sweeps. But there's a category -- each one of those is an important category and outlet for clients. And what we're seeing is clients using all the, I'll call it, all the above, right, including just holding treasury securities. So that we expect to continue and we think deposits will be roughly in this zone in the first quarter. What's a little harder to read is just how noninterest bearing deposits play out. We do expect those to continue to float downward. They tend to float downward for our clients with the largest funds, those are the ones that have been floating down over the last two years. So we continue to see that expectation. There continues to be a little bit of repricing that plays out into the first quarter too as well. And that's why I guided on an NII basis to flat to down 3% for the first quarter, just to give you a little bit of an indication, but we expect that to be roughly on flattish deposits.\nAlex Blostein: My follow-up, sticking with deposits is around just deposit beta as we start to sort of enter the rate cutting cycle. So hoping you could articulate maybe what you're assuming for deposit beta on the way down in your '24 NII guidance? And then broadly, how we should think about sort of the cadence of deposit betas as we progress through the rate cutting cycle into the back half '24, '25 maybe. But just curious to know kind of high at the upper -- at the beginning, lower towards the end or the opposite?\nEric Aboaf: Alex, it's an important topic, because it's how we interact with our clients, it's how we price our products, it's how the industry has operated in for many years. I think you know that our deposit betas on a cumulative basis have climbed quite a bit in the US. They're 75% or so cumulatively since the start of the cycle. In euros, it's around 60% cumulatively in pound sterling, closer to 30% to 35%. So they're clearly moved up. What certainly happens as, and I'll say when, if and when rates fall, is the deposits -- beta is reverse, there's some amount of symmetry. Now they reverse instantaneously, we want to be careful with our clients, we want to be fair. But we do think that over multiple quarters and certainly over any realistic time frame, the Fed cuts and there's got to be an adjustment. Now part of that happens because we have a good bit of our deposits that are indexed to market, they're indexed to market indicators. There are quite a few that are indexed with a spread and then there are a small amount now that has a transactional kind of, I'll call it, administered feature. But you'll generally see a broad amount of symmetry in deposits down versus up. I think what you do need to keep in mind is that our asset sensitivity and liability sensitivity, though, are somewhat different between international markets and in the US, right? In international markets, because those cumulative betas are still in the 30% to 60% range, we're still asset sensitive. So we make more money with increases in rates. And we actually -- NII will trim down with decreases in rates. And that's where we're most -- that's our interest rate sensitivity today. On the US, we have a slight positive bias towards being liability sensitive, but it's still relatively slight. I'd almost call it neutral. So part of what we're doing is just navigating this interest rate environment. It's not exactly clear when the rates come, it's not clear whether the US cuts before Europe or vice versa. And part of what we'll do is actively manage our portfolios to try to take advantage of what's coming. At the same time, we'll price our deposits fairly and prudently.\nOperator: You next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: I think maybe some of what you just said on the non-US side might explain this. But when we think about triangulating the minus 10% to the fact that 1Q is either going to be flat, it’s only down a little on NII, it sort of suggests that your exit rate by the time you get to the 4Q '24 based on what you can see today, it's probably going to be rather low. Am I reading correctly in thinking that it's that non-US piece and that's going to drive some of that weakness? And am I extrapolating the comments correctly to think that we could see a little bit more back end weighted decline for NII?\nEric Aboaf: I think you've got the right general pattern framed in the area of NII. Clearly, we have very strong step off in particular, in December, but in the fourth quarter, which will flow into first quarter, and then we expect a trending down. We had a couple of -- well, probably earlier last year, so a couple of quarters ago, I described an NII range of $550 million to $600 million. And we think we'll get into that range, the top end of that range by around the third quarter. But it's a little bit hard to know the exact shape. We just -- but you've got the right direction of travel. And then we expect some stabilization in the second half of next year, maybe around the top half, the middle half of that range, just really hard to tell exactly where and when. If you step back and ask, what are the underlying drivers? There are really three drivers that continue to be important. In terms of tailwinds, we continue to have long rates playing through the portfolio and the investment portfolio balances as they recoupon at higher rates, that's particularly important in the first half of the year, a little less so in the second half of the year, but that continues through as a positive. You then have, as you mentioned, short rates starting to come down. And because of our sensitivity position across the global markets, that does start to have a headwind impact on NII as those cuts continue to come through. Now we'll see what's the pattern and pace of US versus international cuts. And I think right now, we've pegged to the forward, which shows a lot of consistency in symmetry but we'll see if that really happens, because you can see inflation expectations keep moving around literally daily, weekly. And then the third feature is just client deposits and mix. And while we expect client deposits to be in that zone of $200 million, $210 million, they might bump up above that, a little below that, but they'll be in that broad zone. The mix will continue to shave down out of noninterest bearing over the next quarter or two, we think, it's hard to, again, to predict and then there's -- we're working through the final stages of some of our interest bearing deposit, repricing, those seem to have taken a little longer in some cases than we expected. That's okay, that means we accrete income. But those continue to come through and they'll still play through in the first quarter or two as well. And then that's what kind of brings us to some level of reasonable stability in the back half of the year.\nBrennan Hawken: And by the way, I apologize for background noise that is here. Second question, a bit more strategic. So we saw a flurry of Bitcoin ETF launches here recently. It didn't seem like you all actually landed any of those servicing opportunities. So I want to confirm whether my early read on that is right. And given the magnitude of the investment and the focus you've made on digital assets, what did you learn if you guys missed on that? And is that what led to the restructuring of the digital asset group, and what should we see as a change from that restructuring?\nRon O'Hanley: So Brennan, there were 11 launched on the day that the -- or day after the SEC gave approval, and we actually service three of them. And I think we're the only ones that’s servicing across three different digital custodians. So we helped three of the major players make this happen. So we're quite active in the space. And as you'd expect, we do everything for each of those three except for the actual custody for the reasons that I think you know. So no, we're very active in the space. It was -- what did we learn? I mean it's early. What I think everybody is watching out for is there's a lot of players that went into the market, some of them with some existing high levels of assets. What will be interesting to see over time is, does it actually consolidate and how does it work in terms of who the buyers are institutional versus retail versus intermediary, but these are early days. And it was good to get the uncertainty cleared up and for all this to get launched, and we're keen to be part of it.\nBrennan Hawken: Ron, thanks for clarifying pure custody versus the servicing, Very, very helpful.\nRon O'Hanley: And just to clarify, I mean, I think everybody knows this. But I mean, right now, it's extremely difficult for a bank to do pure custody because of the capital requirements that are imposed on a bank. I mean it's basically 100% capital. So therefore, virtually everybody is working with some kind of digital custodian, a non-bank digital custodian, but all of the other parts of the ecosystem, which we're quite familiar with, we are participating in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: So big flows in SSGA, which is great, good to see, these things are unpredictable, but I am curious on if you had any thoughts towards sustainability? And maybe it would be the color of what clients are buying, what clients are -- I mean, what flavors of ETF are they, the average fee? And what you're specifically doing differently on the distribution front and education front to get at those flows?\nRon O'Hanley: So there are a number of things going on there in the fourth quarter, Glenn, and throughout 2023. I think as we've noted and certainly, you all would have observed, there was -- it was most of the year with some episodic exceptions, it was a risk-off environment that changed in fourth quarter somewhat as predicted once investors got a sense of where interest rates were going, as they did when the Fed communicated in the third quarter more or less a pause. I think that started activity going. So much of the activity late in the year would have been the kind of classic risk on, let's put positions on quickly, benefiting the highly liquid SPDR Core SPY in the sector ETFs. But underlying it and throughout the year, the low cost ETFs, which represent different investors, these would be -- the ultimate holders here tend to be individuals. They're often advised by an intermediary like an RIA, so they’re -- it's very sticky. And we have continued to build share there, both in equity and fixed income, low cost. Across the board, fixed income is seeing a dramatic growth. I think there's increasing acceptance, both by retail investors and institutional investors that the ETF is a good vehicle to hold fixed income and you're just seeing that asset allocation moving that way. And then finally, active ETFs of all sort, you're seeing growth in. And it's been a long time coming. As you know, it's been over a decade on how is this actually going to play out. And it's ironic how it's playing out and that everybody is just taking their standard investment strategy and putting it in active ETF. We benefit from some of that on the GA side in terms of what they're doing in fixed income, but we benefit from it greatly on the servicing side, because we're very, very -- not to overuse the word, active in the active ETF servicing space. And we believe you'll see a lot more growth there as core funds and core offerings of well known asset managers either get converted to ETFs or launched as ETFs. So we're really pleased on the GA side. In terms of what drove it, I think it was the next part of your question. I mean, part of it was much more focused and resources dedicated to the various intermediary channels. I mean our roots are in the institutional channels, but the lots of the growth is in the intermediary channel. So that's part of it. And then as we talked about, I believe, last quarter, we took a hard look at pricing, particularly in the so called low cost ETFs and recognizing their durability, felt that it was worth the investment to reprice them to continue to gain market share because they tend to be very, very sticky.\nGlenn Schorr: I'll go quickly on the follow-up. It's the same question just different on the servicing front, happy with the wins you noted. Maybe we could just drill down. I know it's not huge yet, but the private markets piece of the servicing wins. I'm curious if you want to tell us how much it was, but more importantly, what it is and how -- is it one client or is it multiple clients? I'm curious on how that private market servicing space is developing?\nRon O'Hanley: No, no, it's both. To answer the last part of it first, Glenn, it's certainly not one client. I mean, this is a space that we've invested in and we're well known in. And we see a secular trend here where it's -- so many of these operations are held inside firms are highly bespoke often sitting in very expensive locations. And as the product sets have become more complicated, I mean, it's following a path that the active long only industry followed 10, 15 years ago. It was fine to do all this stuff inside when it was just a couple of products that are fairly straightforward, that's not what's happening now, products are more complicated. As you start to think about the structures that enable high net worth individuals to participate in it, you've got that added complexity. And then oftentimes, there's side investments that are permitted, et cetera. So it's very complicated. It lends itself to outsourcing. It's still very much an in-sourced business. So we see lots of potential growth in it. Its fee characteristics are different, positive in the sense that the fees are higher, but also the fees get fully recognized when the fund is fully invested. So part that we pay a lot of attention to is what's the expected actual, one, money raised and then draw down and how do we do our best to match our expenses to that. But we're very excited about the business. Much of the new investment, product investments that Eric talked about in the 2024 guide includes further strengthening of our position there. There's innovation in there and our goal is to continue to set moats around us so we can continue to excel at it.\nEric Aboaf: I'd just add privates has been a real strong area of growth for us. We've described it as up 10%, 15% in different quarters. So it's a big part of our growth agenda as we -- this past year. And then this coming year, as we take our sales, goals up, the $350 million to $400 million at least a quarter of that plus is going to be around private, and that's what's going to help us continue to drive privates growth. We think in the 15% plus range in terms of year-on-year revenues. So it's an area that I think we've actually broadly with both large and small and midsize, it's actually well distributed and it's got a good mix of US, Europe and Asia sales coming through as well.\nRon O'Hanley: Yes, as well as, Glenn, it's not just private equity, it's private equity -- private credit is booming. And for every bank that complaints about what's going to happen with regulation and the fact that it's pushing activity out of the banking system that's going right into the private credit area, and we should be the beneficiary of that growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Eric, can you share with us -- I know you and Ron were in the State Street 10 years ago, but your comments about the net interest income outlook and just how volatile it is due to what's going on in the bond market with the Federal Reserve and their balance sheet. Are there any indicators you're monitoring that we could look at that might be able to give us a better insight to when net interest income for State Street might be more predictable on a go forward basis?\nEric Aboaf: I take a sigh when I think about this question. I think the predictability is partly around Fed actions, right? This is the highest rate level that we've seen in 22 years. And also if I go back a couple of years, the lowest rate level we've probably seen in two decades as well, right? So we've kind of -- we're at these wide bookends relative to really since the -- I want to say, the turn of the century, right, and that's really created this volatility. Can we manage that and mitigate? Well, we do try to sustain on a regular basis, match off deposit, deposit tenor, rate characteristics with the asset side of the portfolio and we do that with duration. The challenge is if you take too little duration, you have even more volatility. If you have to take too much duration on the asset side of the portfolio, you've got more AOCI risk, and so our tools to stabilize work up to a point and then have some negative implications. So I don't really see a way to turn what we'd like to have -- I don't see a way to turn this into just a flywheel of metronome that moves at a certain pace, and it's just a feature of what we do. And part of it is our institutional deposits have somewhat more asset sensitivity or liability sensitivity to rates relative to a very simple regional bank. So we'll tend to have a little more, but that's part of the industry, I think we're in line with peers.\nGerard Cassidy: Ron, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the success and the momentum you're having with the Alpha product in the servicing business -- in the Investment Services business, I should say. Is there any capacity constraints that you've got to be careful about if the momentum continues, or is it almost now when you got plenty of bandwidth to handle future growth?\nRon O'Hanley: I would say that the capacity constraint has been particularly with these large complicated client, the really large ones, some of which are -- well, most of which are still being onboarded, the capacity strength has been around onboarding. Over past year, in particular, we've gotten better at that. You can -- if you just look at that number, we were roughly at about, as I recall, $3.6 trillion in assets to be onboarded and we're now down to $2.3 trillion. So you can see we're getting better at that. The real constraint to be specific about it tends to be and how quickly do you onboard the middle office element to that, because that often requires engineering and by that I mean, engineering with the client, because ultimately that's a client and it's like any other kind of industrial outsourcing. A client has an operation, those things in a particular way wants to outsource that element of it to us. We're not interested in taking somebody's mess for less. I mean, we need to actually work with them to engineer it in a way where as much of it as possible is standardized and that the customization is limited to the extensive user interfaces or how things are actually applied. And we've just gotten better at that over time. So I would say, looking forward, we don't see that as being a meaningful constraint.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Just maybe a follow-up on the -- outside of sort of the private markets, you've ramped up pretty quickly in terms of getting to your $400 million of new servicing fee wins. And maybe if private markets are a quarter, can we talk a little bit about the other three quarters, where you've seen success, what's worked, what hasn't worked and what kind of opportunity set do you see maybe even get above the $100 million?\nRon O'Hanley: I mean, it's no one thing, but a lot of really important things across the board to ramp up our execution. Where we're seeing it, to answer the first part of your question, is the core Investment Managers segment still remains strong and active for us. And as some of those firms are facing the same kind of market that everybody else is, they're more interested in actually trying to do more with us and do different things with us, a little bit of a resurgence in the asset owner marketplace and in particular, amongst asset owners that aren't just pure asset allocators, meaning they're managing some assets themselves or truly actively asset allocating, doing not just listening to a consultant telling them what to do, but either managing money or at a strategic and tactical level, allocating assets, which again requires support. But in all cases, what we're doing is we're really focused on ensuring that the back office part of all this comes with it, and comes with it in a timely fashion, right? Because as I was saying earlier when I was talking to Gerard, the thing that takes a long time or a longer time to onboard would be the middle office, the outsourcing element of it. Onboarding back office is pretty easy, pretty straightforward. And it, in almost all instances, comes down in a pretty healthy incremental margin given the scale activities to it. And then finally, just to talk about regions. We have invested heavily in the capabilities in all of our regions where you see probably the most impact from that over the last couple of years, has been just the very good growth that we're seeing in Asia Pacific and really, all parts of Asia Pacific from Australia north to Japan and everything in between. The US, we've talked about in the past, we were not pleased with where we were in this past year, particularly the second half of the year. We're actually reasonably pleased with how we've done. Europe has always been strong to us. It was a little softer in 2023, but again, a very strong pipeline. But that regional focus where we're actually pushing accountability down into the country and regional level and making sure that it's very clear who is responsible for what, sharing, obviously, not just the technology and the product but the best practices in how you move these things forward, but very much decentralizing the accountability.\nJim Mitchell: And maybe, Eric, just a quick one on the held maturity book still yielding just a little over 2%. Can you kind of walk us through the maturity profile of that, how long we start to see some pickup in -- or turnover and reinvestment benefits from that portfolio?\nEric Aboaf: The way I’d describe it is we've got a natural roll-off in that portfolio. It's about $5 billion a year. So it sort of plays out and that's related to the maturity in the latter, so that will come down over the next couple of years. As that happens, because as you say, it's at a lower coupon relative to our average, right? Our average portfolio yields are in the 3.5 range. There's real pickup that comes through that line. At least for the next couple of quarters, I guess, is probably for the next couple of years even, because once rates stabilize, we do think that we'll also get some steepness in the yield curve and that will help through. So there are some benefits coming that way. It's also a portfolio that obviously will insulate us from rate moves. I don't think in the next few years, this is the last down cycle versus up cycle then that we'll see and so it will serve its purpose then as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So Eric, I wanted to start off with a question just on the fee guidance, and benchmarking your historical fee performance versus the guidance. You've struggled to at least meet or exceed the guide in the absence of significant equity market gains. Can you guys hear me okay?\nEric Aboaf: Yes.\nSteven Chubak: So you have a conservative market assumption embedded in the fee guide for the coming year. And just given that historical experience, I was hoping you could just provide additional granularity in terms of growth across the different fee lines that's underpinning that 3% to 4% growth assumption for this year?\nEric Aboaf: Let me maybe describe it in a couple of ways, because 3% to 4% is for the overall franchise. We think that there are some areas of the franchise that will be higher and in some cases, a good bit higher than that. Asset Management, very geared towards the equity markets and the 10% tailwind in equity markets, comes through on literally half of that tends to the right through the asset management fee line, and then the flows that we talked about earlier in the call provide a nice tailwind. So we need to see how markets play through. But the combination of those two, which is exactly how the business is designed, it's market based and it's flow based, will be healthy. I think software and data processing, we've historically said high single digits, sometimes low double digits. If you look at the last couple of years, you're at the 9%, 10% average full year growth. And we've got good visibility there, part of that is Alpha and part of that is outright software and data sales, and so that's strong. I think at the other bookend, servicing fees will come in -- it will be a bit below the 3% to 4%, now some of that is core organic net new business that we need to drive, which is why we've reshaped and tuned that area, in particular on the sales and how we go to market. You're seeing some of the benefits there and how we measure ourselves. We're being very conscious there. But one of the reasons that one will be lower this coming year is that we had that previously announced transition coming through, which will mute some of what we'd like to see. And then the markets activities, we're hoping will be somewhere in the middle of the range, whether FX trading and sec finance. I think what plays out behind the market dependent areas and sometimes why we don't need is around client -- what we describe as client activity, how much transactional activity, whether our clients are on the sidelines or whether they're all in, that this past year on the servicing fees which are half of our fees, that was worth 2 to 3 percentage points of servicing fee headwind. I mean that literally. So you do the math, that's worth $100 million, $150 million of headwind because we don't have those -- that activity, the transactional activity in derivatives, in international custody, which is very, very valuable to us. So part of what plays through is these macroeconomic features, equity bond markets on one hand, you've got client, the kind of risk-on risk-off sentiment, I think, is important. You've got volatility levels in FX and agency lending. And so those we have to live through and navigate through, and sometimes those will come in more strongly and sometimes less. And then I think finally, the piece that we do need to deliver on, Steve, is the part that we can control, which is sales, it's retention. And we've been very clear about our goals and our targets very purposely, because that's where we think we need to hold ourselves particularly accountable and where you can hold us accountable. And there's a version of goals and targets in servicing, we spent a little extra time there. But if you go through our line of businesses, we've got similar kinds of goals area by area and that's on us to deliver, which will help power us through. But the cyclical elements will still come and go.\nSteven Chubak: Just one quick follow-up from me. What's the assumed timing for the large client transition? Just wanted to get a sense as to whether that's reflected in the 1Q servicing fee guide or you're expecting that later in the year?\nEric Aboaf: Let me see how -- let me try to describe this to you in a couple of ways and to be helpful. At this point, on a quarterly run rate basis, and I say that very specifically, we're about halfway through the transition, including a piece that came out in the fourth quarter. So we're halfway through on a quarterly run rate basis. We also, though, have to think about it on a fiscal year-on-year basis. And the way I would describe it on a fiscal year-on-year basis, remember, we said this was worth about 2 percentage points of total fees, that's what we've disclosed in our Qs and Ks. About a quarter of that fiscally has come out through the end of '23, about half of it will come out through '24 and about another quarter in '25, so it just takes time to play through. And so we did include that headwind in the first quarter '24 versus first quarter '23 guide, and it is important to that guide. And so our guide includes that and you've got the net guide as a result.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Just a very quick follow-up. I know the call has gone on so long, Eric. I heard you talk about just the right level of deposits between 200 and 210 . Did you say that you expect the growth we saw in fourth quarter to reverse in 1Q as we think about why deposits shake out?\nEric Aboaf: No, what I said is that we think we'll operate in the $200 billion to $210 billion range in the first quarter, second, through the year. We expect that to be where we land. I think in fourth quarter on average, right? Remember, we also, I think, talked a little bit about the months, we talked there's end of period data, which is very volatile. But on average, we ended up at, I think, around $207 billion for the quarter in 4Q. And so we think roughly flattish deposits into 1Q. It's just hard to tell, there's seasonality at year end, there tends to be a low point in February, and then you've got cash building for tax purposes into March. But I'd call it flattish in the scheme of things but with a range around that.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And just a bigger picture question around NIB mix and NII. Do we need to get to a point where QT is short, the Fed is done with cutting rates before we see NII stabilize and maybe the deposit mix shift would stabilize as well? Like do we need to get to that point or can it happen sooner than that?\nEric Aboaf: My instinct on this is NIB will begin to stabilize sometime in 2024, we think sometime in the by the middle of the year or third quarter. You've kind of, at that point, I'll call it, burn through the largest accounts, those are the ones that kind of on a -- since its peak are down 75% in NIB. The smallest accounts are down by about 25% since the peak and those were seeing stabilize more and more. So I think we'll see some stability in NIB because clients and funds and fund boards have made their decisions, especially the ones that have $1 million or $2 million in an account, some of them just don't want to deal with the tax reporting, and so you'll get to some stabilization. So we think that will kind of stabilize. I think the broader question on NII will then come with how, what -- well, and at that point, I think deposit betas kind of tend to stabilize as well. So I think at that point, in the second half of next year, the real question is what is the direction of interest rates on the front end. So very important question, which is what's going to -- where is the long end going to go? And where is the long end going to go in the US versus in the international markets. And that is particularly important to the banking sector because with some amount of steepness in the yield curve, and it's hard to remember when we've had steepness, it's been a while, some amount of steepness in the yield curve is quite accretive to NII, and you expect in a good economy to have some. And so that will be a feature. So there's a series of elements that will come through, and it's hard to I think, to, as a result, predict too precisely.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Kenny Morgan Stanley.\nRyan Kenny: Just a follow-up on the capital side. So you had an 11.6% CET1 ratio that was a nice improvement sequentially, it looks like that was driven mostly by $6 billion of lower RWA. Can you just help us impact the RWA dynamics a bit, what drove the optimization? And then you also mentioned RWA could be higher this year to support various businesses. Does that mean that the optimization was just temporary?\nEric Aboaf: Let me describe it in a couple of different ways. We're all -- every bank tries to manage RWA just because it's part of our capital requirements and returns. And we try to report it carefully and we do it fully to the rules, as you'd expect. What tends to create the volatility because it's a spot measure, it's a one day of the quarter, one out of 90-day measure is the market factors. So if you've got an FX, or in any of the trading businesses if you've got a forward book or even a vanilla derivative book, you've got counterparty exposures, you've got -- that are affected in particular by the currency pairs. And as those move around in the last week of the quarter, you might be in the money or out of the money in those positions and those directly because of how to standardize RWA mathematics were just goes right through RWA. So that could create a swing of $4 billion, $5 billion on the size of our RWAs. Our RWAs is about 100 -- we printed around $112 billion, about half of that is in the markets area. And so there's a good bit of variability, and that's literally what happens. And so sometimes it will end up low, sometimes it will end up high. If you look at Page 14 of the presentation matures, you'll see low point of $107 billion a year ago in RWA, you'll see a higher point of $118 billion last quarter and quite a bit of that is driven by just those market factors playing through into the calculations that we have. And then in addition to that, if you're on a loan book like we do, you'll have overdrafts, overdrafts take RWA as well. And so we also saw some amount of benefit there this quarter. I think the way I would describe the go-forward view is that we ended up particularly low this quarter. We said it could be $6 billion, $7 billion lower than expected. What would par be, maybe I'll describe it that way, going forward, it might be $118 billion, it might be $120 billion. But you've got to put plus $5 billion, minus $5 billion band around that. And so what we want to do is we want to gently continue to reinvest capital into our businesses, because these FX businesses now that we have, have good returns. We've managed them well, they've got 10%, 12% returns in many cases. The securities finance businesses typically are high single digit return businesses, but that's healthy and it's very connected to the servicing and the administrative fee business that we have and important to our clients. And so our view is that these are ways for us to solidify and expand and deepen our relationship with clients. And so we'll gently add RWA each year. How much do we add? We add a few billion dollars, $3 billion to $5 billion of more RWA each year perhaps. But there'll be some volatility around that. And that will be a part of the way we drive our organic growth. We're a high return bank, that's for sure. But we do want to put some of our capital to work for core organic growth reasons.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW.\nMike Brown: I guess I noticed that you saw record cash net inflows in 2023. And you mentioned that you actually took share in the institutional money market space. As we head into a declining rate environment here, I guess what's your expectation about how these cash and money fund assets could trend from here? I guess, historically, institutional money markets, they can act quite differently than retail. So I guess, once the Fed begins to reduce rates here, what are you thinking about in terms of the path of the flows out of money funds, could you actually still see some money fund inflows from institutional investors?\nRon O'Hanley: Mike, it's a good question and one we think about all the time. So part of way we've attracted more money market funds going back to one of my prior answers is we just have a broader client base, and that helps. We've gained market share, not just in terms of assets, but we've just attracted more clients. And once you have them, whether the balances go up or down, typically you have them. I think historically, what's happened in terms -- and you've got to look back in history now, because we haven't had this kind of a marketplace. But the really sophisticated holders of institutional money market funds tend to hang on, because the fund itself, depending on its duration, and there is a little bit of duration in it, actually lags. So it's usually the opposite -- when rates are rising, the very sophisticated holders are toggling in and out depending on whether they see opportunities to go direct. Just given the nature of our client base, we don't see a lot of that activity. So we expect to keep them and it really will be around where do their balances go and do they need it for some other reasons, or do they see more attractive investment opportunities. I would expect that we would see, if indeed, we see a continued risk on environment that itself will cause a little bit of reallocation of institutional money market funds, because saying that everybody -- what everybody is talking about that there's so much parked on the sidelines while a lot of it is parked here. But I would go back to where I began the answer, which is it really is about establishing more client relationships, servicing them very well and then continue to grow the number of clients based on that track record.\nMike Brown: The $5 billion share buyback authorization that certainly was a big number. Eric, as you just alluded to in the last question, there's a lot of puts and takes to consider on the capital front in 2024 and into 2025. I guess my question is really just why come with such a large authorization? You're targeting 100% payout ratio. So this would seem to me that you certainly would not need all of that in 2024. is this just a desire to have kind of a big authorization in place for a multiyear horizon or just to have more flexibility over time, just love to hear a little bit more about that?\nEric Aboaf: The background here is that the industry has evolved, I would say, pre-CCAR, which is a long time ago, there used to be open ended authorizations in the banking sector. Once we got into CCAR, remember, there was a very defined annual amount of buybacks that you had to submit. In fact, you had to submit the first year and the second year and there was a lot of -- making sure that what you submitted within the Fed CCAR process was actually what you did, because wanted to keep consistency with that. And so the industry moved towards quite a bit of disclosure on a one year basis as a result. And if you recall, a lot of those one year disclosures happened right after CCAR was announced at the -- either at the end of June or in the second quarter earnings in July. What we've seen as we've scanned at least the banking, our peer banks, the G-SIBs, the large US regionals is now that CCAR is -- it's still an annual process, but it's really with the SCB and some of the refinements to it, it's really an ongoing process. And what we've realized is that I'd say more than three quarters of our peers, you probably know, have actually moved to open ended programs over the last year, year and a half. And so we just wanted to conform to that. As a result, this one is multiyear, it's open ended and we'll take it from there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Well, no good deed goes unpunished $5 billion buyback to that last question. But are you assuming that Basel III gets modified? And if Basel III didn't exist, how much higher would that $5 billion number be? And at what price do you say buybacks don't make so much sense anymore?\nRon O'Hanley: Mike, maybe I'll start on the Basel III. I think where Basel III comes out is very uncertain at this point. The comment period ended January 16th. I don't know how many millions of pages were submitted, but there's a lot to be evaluated there. And you all know the various pressure and response that the regulators are getting on this. So it's very hard to tell. I don't know that we would have changed the authorization if we had perfect clarity on where it was coming out, it was a factor, but it's not like we have -- we think it's absolutely going to be this and therefore. So I hope that helps.\nMike Mayo: So where your base case, what is the RWA inflation, the most recent updates, we've gotten a few changes here during earnings season due to Basel III?\nEric Aboaf: Mike, let me describe it this way. The headline that we've previously disclosed for the ANPR as it's written is Basel RWA increase for us at about 15%. So that's what we've shared. I think what we said at the time and we actually believe even more so now is that it will come in at a portion of that. There's been lots of discussion around, for example, energy tax credits, some of the arcane parts of Basel and how that impacts public policy mortgages, which were not really affected on. There's much more discussion about operational risk literally over the last few months and that would make us quite optimistic that the increases would be relatively small. So we've not updated it because it's just there's a menu out there, but we're encouraged. We think the regulators are trying to navigate public policy on one hand and the right level of capital in the banking system. But we think that the direction of the discussions, in particular, over the last few months are constructive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Most of the questions have been asked and answered. Just one quick one on securities portfolio repositioning. I guess, Eric, what's the desire to potentially do more of those and potentially take losses and look at the sort of the capital usage for doing that and enhancing NII and NIM more versus share buybacks?\nEric Aboaf: It's something that we continue to think about. I think every bank continues to think about, we included. We're just continuing to just work through how do we feel about the rate levels that we're at, in particular up on the curve. We are conscious of that, both in the US and in the international areas. We've got positions in pounds sterling and euros and so forth. So we'll just continue to evaluate it. I think as you indicated from your question, part of the reason we repositioned last year in the third quarter was around rate position. We thought it was a very good entry point. In retrospect, we timed that quite well. So we were quite pleased. And I think we felt like we came out ahead economically with the trade because we remember, we took out some bonds but also reinvested both in the belly of the curve and overnight. So that was constructive. And we'll also keep an eye on -- we don't have a lot of capital intensive securities, we've always had a very vanilla book. So there's not an enormous capital motivation, but we'll selectively look at it and see if it might make sense. But I think we're like many others, it's one of the things we keep an eye on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.\nRob Wildhack: I wanted to ask about the fee operating leverage target for this year. Hypothetically, let's say, fees come in better than you expect. Would you anticipate dropping that down to the bottom line or reinvesting it? And maybe the same question in reverse, fees come in lower than expected. What kind of room is there on the expense side to preserve your fee operating leverage target?\nRon O'Hanley: Rob, why don't I start on that. We feel like we've done a very good job this year in terms of -- in 2023, focusing on BAU cost reduction to help finance and create a very sizable investment pool. Eric walked you through that. So obviously, if fees are up dramatically more than expected, there are some revenue related expenses. But I wouldn't foresee -- I think we've got a lot to invest and execute against and I really won't want to get through that. On the margin, there might be a few things that we would do, but the vast majority of it will go to the bottom line. the case of the -- if the opposite occurs, whatever, a terrible market, geopolitical issues, flare and you've just got a very different environment than any one of us anticipate. Again, we'd probably -- you'd see some revenue related expenses come down naturally, which would help. I think at least my initial instinct would be to try and preserve the investments and look at is there any more to do on BAU, but then obviously, some of these -- we've got a pecking order for our investments in terms of priorities. And if it came to that, we’d defer them.\nEric Aboaf: I would just add that we've got a pretty industrial productivity plan for this year. Part of that was the repositioning that we announced, but two thirds of the roles impacted are really around delayering and simplifying State Street. We're actually taking our spans of control in some areas like operations from 5:1 to 8:1. We're taking standard controls in the business and staff functions in some cases from 3:1 to 5:1. And the benefit of that is it actually brings our teams, our client teams and operational teams even closer to our clients. And some of what we're doing with the joint venture consolidation is a catalyst for that because, in some cases, we had too many hand offs and now we can simplify processes and again, bring them closer to our clients. So there's some real structural changes there. And what we do want to do is make sure we see those through. As Ron mentioned, there's always a little more, we'll look at on the margin but we want to be careful. We want to do this right. But on the margin, you continue to work on vendors and so forth, you look at performance based incentive compensation, there are always other smaller levers. But we're pretty -- I think we've got a nice work set out and a lot to do. And I think we've got real confidence that this is, I think, year probably five. I don't think we name our programs with annual versions. But this is probably a year five of productivity program and should really deliver quite a bit.\nRob Wildhack: And then on the regulatory front, there was some commentary last week from the FDIC around regulations for large index fund providers. I'm curious if you have any thoughts there on how that can potentially impact your business?\nRon O'Hanley: From the FDIC, I didn't see this, Rob. Curious as to the FDIC's role in index funds. I wonder what Vanguard has to say about that. So I'm just not familiar with it, Rob.\nRob Wildhack: I can send it over to you later.\nEric Aboaf: Why don't we follow up off-line, Rob, just send it through to Ilene and the team.\nRon O'Hanley: Yes, it could be, Rob, that GA is already on this. I just haven't seen that.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Please proceed.\nRon O'Hanley: Well, thank you everybody for joining the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As I reflect on 2023, the operating environment was dynamic with a complex set of challenges for the world's investors and for our industry, and I am proud of how we carefully navigated State Street through various headwinds, while continuing to execute against our strategic agenda. We focused and delivered on that agenda in three key areas; achieve strong sales wins across our businesses, drive strategic change in our investment services business and remain disciplined on productivity and broader cost management. Further on that last point, during 2023, we implemented key productivity actions and announced additional efficiency measures that will enable us to enhance the productivity of our operating model in 2024 and the years ahead. We took these many actions all while investing in our business and returning substantial capital to our shareholders, which helped to drive full year earnings growth excluding notable items. The world's investors, State Street and our industry, faced a host of significant market events and macroeconomic forces in 2023. In the first quarter, turmoil in the banking sector ultimately led to the resolution from several banks, which was a catalyst for some of the largest fixed income market moves seen in decades. In the second quarter, anticipation grew about the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence, helping to drive equity markets higher. However, as we progress into the third quarter and as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to the highest level in 2022 years in July, the prospect of higher for longer rates led to a substantial sell off in bond markets with the US 10-year treasury yield exceeding 5% in October, for the first time since the global financial crisis. Rate uncertainty and an increasing number of geopolitical concerns caused equities to struggle. Then during the fourth quarter, the equity market rallied vigorously as inflation receded and investors grew increasingly optimistic about a soft landing with positive sentiment gaining further momentum in the last month as the Federal Reserve signaled a pivot to lower interest rates this year. In sum, while our full year overall financial results benefited from higher interest rates globally last year and despite the strong market appreciation in the fourth quarter, daily average global equity markets only increased by low single digits in 2023, providing just a modest tailwind to our fee revenue, while client activity was muted as investors stayed on the sidelines for much of the year. And even in such an eventful year, equity and FX market volatility continued to contract creating revenue headwinds for our trading businesses. Slide 3 of our investor presentation provides some of our highlights for the year. Beginning with our financial performance, full year earnings per share was 5.58 or 7.66 excluding notable items. Year-over-year, excluding notable items, EPS growth was supported by $3.8 billion of common share repurchases, a record level of NII, continued growth of our front office software and data business and higher securities finance revenues. The combination of which more than offset the impact of lower servicing and management fees and underlying expense growth, which was still well controlled. We continued to build business momentum and position State Street for longer term success. To that end, we achieved a number of important accomplishments in 2023, as you can see on Slide 3. A key highlight of today's results is the clear progress we're making on innovation and advancing product capabilities, which in turn contributes to stronger sales momentum across our broad franchise aimed at generating better fee revenue growth in the year ahead. Within the Investment Services business, we are intensely focused on ensuring better execution against our strategy and revenue goals. We unveiled the sharpened execution plan last year, underpinned by a number of measurable actions aimed at driving servicing opportunities across key regions and product areas, realizing the full potential of our Alpha value proposition and accelerating sales and revenue growth, particularly in our core back office custody. Encouragingly, as I just noted, today's results demonstrate our proven ability to deliver the level of sales required for attractive organic servicing fee revenue growth for the future as we built upon the $91 million of new servicing fee sales in third quarter by recording $103 million of new servicing fee wins in 4Q, which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in recent years. From its inception, we have noted that Alpha will further establish, broaden and deepen client relationships, positioning State Street as our client's essential partner. Alpha distinctively enables us to grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's capability as a true one State Street solution for our clients from front to back. 2023 was an important year for Alpha software delivery. Last two quarters of the year included the significant development of the fixed income portfolio management module, which propel CRD and Alpha capabilities and competitiveness forward. In 3Q, we recorded our first Alpha for private markets client. And in the fourth quarter, we continued Alpha's momentum by deepening relationships with a number of key existing mandates and recording four new Alpha wins, while our front office software and data business had a record quarter of new bookings in 4Q, both demonstrating our ability to drive stronger sales. Within our Global Markets business, even as low volatility created a headwind, we continued to see proof points of our very strong market position. For example, in its 2023 FX awards, Euromoney Magazine named State Street as the winner across four important categories, including the best FX bank for real money clients. We also continued to innovate and strategically expand our product capabilities and geographic reach, including the planned acquisition of outsourced trading firm CF Global Trading. At Global Advisors, we undertook targeted strategic actions aimed at gaining market share and driving occupancy growth in the coming years. As a result, we saw encouraging business momentum with GA setting a number of growth records in 2023. A number of key performance indicators make us optimistic as we look ahead. For example, in Q4, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate total flows, including record quarterly flows within our SPDR ETF franchise, amounting to a capture of 21% of total global ETF flows in Q4 and ending 2023 with a record level of total ETF assets under management. Our cash business had an exceptional year delivering record annual flows in 2023 with institutional money market fund AUM also reaching a record. Overall, we gained market share in a number of key areas, including institutional money market funds and US low cost equity and fixed income ETFs. Turning to our efficiency and productivity efforts. Underlying expense growth was well controlled in 2023 with full year expenses increasing 3%, excluding notable items. Q4 expenses, excluding notable items, rose just 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of our ongoing expense actions. Transforming our operations to improve effectiveness and efficiency and realize productivity growth remains a key priority for us. To that end, we announced important steps in our multiyear productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model. As we previously announced, we are streamlining our operations in India. We have now assumed control of one of our joint ventures in that country with a second joint venture consolidation expected to close in spring. We expect these actions will accelerate the transformation of State Street's global operations, improve service quality and client experience and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive free operating leverage in 2024. Turning to Slide 4 of our presentation. You can see our fourth quarter financial highlights and business trends and indicators, which Eric will shortly take you through in more detail. Before I conclude my opening remarks, I would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength, which has enabled us to return substantial amount of excess capital in recent quarters. For example, over the last five quarters to the end of December, we have returned $6.4 billion of capital to our shareholders. As we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return, in 2024, it is currently our intention to return approximately 100% of earnings in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions. Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common share purchase program of up to $5 billion with no set expiration date. To conclude, while 2023 was an eventful year, we finished strongly in 4Q, which creates an encouraging starting point for our businesses into 2024. This year, we remain highly focused on both the execution of our strategy and the accountability for results. Our goals are clear. We must continue the improvement in our sales performance that we demonstrated in the second half of 2023, continue to implement a set of productivity initiatives and product enhancements that will drive longer term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024, all while returning capital to our shareholders. We are laser focused on these goals. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Thank you, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. So Brennan, there were 11 launched on the day that the -- or day after the SEC gave approval, and we actually service three of them. And I think we're the only ones that's servicing across three different digital custodians. So we helped three of the major players make this happen. So we're quite active in the space. And as you'd expect, we do everything for each of those three except for the actual custody for the reasons that I think you know. So no, we're very active in the space. It was -- what did we learn? I mean it's early. What I think everybody is watching out for is there's a lot of players that went into the market, some of them with some existing high levels of assets. What will be interesting to see over time is, does it actually consolidate and how does it work in terms of who the buyers are institutional versus retail versus intermediary, but these are early days. And it was good to get the uncertainty cleared up and for all this to get launched, and we're keen to be part of it. And just to clarify, I mean, I think everybody knows this. But I mean, right now, it's extremely difficult for a bank to do pure custody because of the capital requirements that are imposed on a bank. I mean it's basically 100% capital. So therefore, virtually everybody is working with some kind of digital custodian, a non-bank digital custodian, but all of the other parts of the ecosystem, which we're quite familiar with, we are participating in. So there are a number of things going on there in the fourth quarter, Glenn, and throughout 2023. I think as we've noted and certainly, you all would have observed, there was -- it was most of the year with some episodic exceptions, it was a risk-off environment that changed in fourth quarter somewhat as predicted once investors got a sense of where interest rates were going, as they did when the Fed communicated in the third quarter more or less a pause. I think that started activity going. So much of the activity late in the year would have been the kind of classic risk on, let's put positions on quickly, benefiting the highly liquid SPDR Core SPY in the sector ETFs. But underlying it and throughout the year, the low cost ETFs, which represent different investors, these would be -- the ultimate holders here tend to be individuals. They're often advised by an intermediary like an RIA, so they're -- it's very sticky. And we have continued to build share there, both in equity and fixed income, low cost. Across the board, fixed income is seeing a dramatic growth. I think there's increasing acceptance, both by retail investors and institutional investors that the ETF is a good vehicle to hold fixed income and you're just seeing that asset allocation moving that way. And then finally, active ETFs of all sort, you're seeing growth in. And it's been a long time coming. As you know, it's been over a decade on how is this actually going to play out. And it's ironic how it's playing out and that everybody is just taking their standard investment strategy and putting it in active ETF. We benefit from some of that on the GA side in terms of what they're doing in fixed income, but we benefit from it greatly on the servicing side, because we're very, very -- not to overuse the word, active in the active ETF servicing space. And we believe you'll see a lot more growth there as core funds and core offerings of well known asset managers either get converted to ETFs or launched as ETFs. So we're really pleased on the GA side. In terms of what drove it, I think it was the next part of your question. I mean, part of it was much more focused and resources dedicated to the various intermediary channels. I mean our roots are in the institutional channels, but the lots of the growth is in the intermediary channel. So that's part of it. And then as we talked about, I believe, last quarter, we took a hard look at pricing, particularly in the so called low cost ETFs and recognizing their durability, felt that it was worth the investment to reprice them to continue to gain market share because they tend to be very, very sticky. No, no, it's both. To answer the last part of it first, Glenn, it's certainly not one client. I mean, this is a space that we've invested in and we're well known in. And we see a secular trend here where it's -- so many of these operations are held inside firms are highly bespoke often sitting in very expensive locations. And as the product sets have become more complicated, I mean, it's following a path that the active long only industry followed 10, 15 years ago. It was fine to do all this stuff inside when it was just a couple of products that are fairly straightforward, that's not what's happening now, products are more complicated. As you start to think about the structures that enable high net worth individuals to participate in it, you've got that added complexity. And then oftentimes, there's side investments that are permitted, et cetera. So it's very complicated. It lends itself to outsourcing. It's still very much an in-sourced business. So we see lots of potential growth in it. Its fee characteristics are different, positive in the sense that the fees are higher, but also the fees get fully recognized when the fund is fully invested. So part that we pay a lot of attention to is what's the expected actual, one, money raised and then draw down and how do we do our best to match our expenses to that. But we're very excited about the business. Much of the new investment, product investments that Eric talked about in the 2024 guide includes further strengthening of our position there. There's innovation in there and our goal is to continue to set moats around us so we can continue to excel at it. Yes, as well as, Glenn, it's not just private equity, it's private equity -- private credit is booming. And for every bank that complaints about what's going to happen with regulation and the fact that it's pushing activity out of the banking system that's going right into the private credit area, and we should be the beneficiary of that growth. I would say that the capacity constraint has been particularly with these large complicated client, the really large ones, some of which are -- well, most of which are still being onboarded, the capacity strength has been around onboarding. Over past year, in particular, we've gotten better at that. You can -- if you just look at that number, we were roughly at about, as I recall, $3.6 trillion in assets to be onboarded and we're now down to $2.3 trillion. So you can see we're getting better at that. The real constraint to be specific about it tends to be and how quickly do you onboard the middle office element to that, because that often requires engineering and by that I mean, engineering with the client, because ultimately that's a client and it's like any other kind of industrial outsourcing. A client has an operation, those things in a particular way wants to outsource that element of it to us. We're not interested in taking somebody's mess for less. I mean, we need to actually work with them to engineer it in a way where as much of it as possible is standardized and that the customization is limited to the extensive user interfaces or how things are actually applied. And we've just gotten better at that over time. So I would say, looking forward, we don't see that as being a meaningful constraint. I mean, it's no one thing, but a lot of really important things across the board to ramp up our execution. Where we're seeing it, to answer the first part of your question, is the core Investment Managers segment still remains strong and active for us. And as some of those firms are facing the same kind of market that everybody else is, they're more interested in actually trying to do more with us and do different things with us, a little bit of a resurgence in the asset owner marketplace and in particular, amongst asset owners that aren't just pure asset allocators, meaning they're managing some assets themselves or truly actively asset allocating, doing not just listening to a consultant telling them what to do, but either managing money or at a strategic and tactical level, allocating assets, which again requires support. But in all cases, what we're doing is we're really focused on ensuring that the back office part of all this comes with it, and comes with it in a timely fashion, right? Because as I was saying earlier when I was talking to Gerard, the thing that takes a long time or a longer time to onboard would be the middle office, the outsourcing element of it. Onboarding back office is pretty easy, pretty straightforward. And it, in almost all instances, comes down in a pretty healthy incremental margin given the scale activities to it. And then finally, just to talk about regions. We have invested heavily in the capabilities in all of our regions where you see probably the most impact from that over the last couple of years, has been just the very good growth that we're seeing in Asia Pacific and really, all parts of Asia Pacific from Australia north to Japan and everything in between. The US, we've talked about in the past, we were not pleased with where we were in this past year, particularly the second half of the year. We're actually reasonably pleased with how we've done. Europe has always been strong to us. It was a little softer in 2023, but again, a very strong pipeline. But that regional focus where we're actually pushing accountability down into the country and regional level and making sure that it's very clear who is responsible for what, sharing, obviously, not just the technology and the product but the best practices in how you move these things forward, but very much decentralizing the accountability. Mike, it's a good question and one we think about all the time. So part of way we've attracted more money market funds going back to one of my prior answers is we just have a broader client base, and that helps. We've gained market share, not just in terms of assets, but we've just attracted more clients. And once you have them, whether the balances go up or down, typically you have them. I think historically, what's happened in terms -- and you've got to look back in history now, because we haven't had this kind of a marketplace. But the really sophisticated holders of institutional money market funds tend to hang on, because the fund itself, depending on its duration, and there is a little bit of duration in it, actually lags. So it's usually the opposite -- when rates are rising, the very sophisticated holders are toggling in and out depending on whether they see opportunities to go direct. Just given the nature of our client base, we don't see a lot of that activity. So we expect to keep them and it really will be around where do their balances go and do they need it for some other reasons, or do they see more attractive investment opportunities. I would expect that we would see, if indeed, we see a continued risk on environment that itself will cause a little bit of reallocation of institutional money market funds, because saying that everybody -- what everybody is talking about that there's so much parked on the sidelines while a lot of it is parked here. But I would go back to where I began the answer, which is it really is about establishing more client relationships, servicing them very well and then continue to grow the number of clients based on that track record. Mike, maybe I'll start on the Basel III. I think where Basel III comes out is very uncertain at this point. The comment period ended January 16th. I don't know how many millions of pages were submitted, but there's a lot to be evaluated there. And you all know the various pressure and response that the regulators are getting on this. So it's very hard to tell. I don't know that we would have changed the authorization if we had perfect clarity on where it was coming out, it was a factor, but it's not like we have -- we think it's absolutely going to be this and therefore. So I hope that helps. Rob, why don't I start on that. We feel like we've done a very good job this year in terms of -- in 2023, focusing on BAU cost reduction to help finance and create a very sizable investment pool. Eric walked you through that. So obviously, if fees are up dramatically more than expected, there are some revenue related expenses. But I wouldn't foresee -- I think we've got a lot to invest and execute against and I really won't want to get through that. On the margin, there might be a few things that we would do, but the vast majority of it will go to the bottom line. the case of the -- if the opposite occurs, whatever, a terrible market, geopolitical issues, flare and you've just got a very different environment than any one of us anticipate. Again, we'd probably -- you'd see some revenue related expenses come down naturally, which would help. I think at least my initial instinct would be to try and preserve the investments and look at is there any more to do on BAU, but then obviously, some of these -- we've got a pecking order for our investments in terms of priorities. And if it came to that, we'd defer them. From the FDIC, I didn't see this, Rob. Curious as to the FDIC's role in index funds. I wonder what Vanguard has to say about that. So I'm just not familiar with it, Rob. Yes, it could be, Rob, that GA is already on this. I just haven't seen that. Well, thank you everybody for joining the call."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, let me briefly discuss the notable items we recognized in the quarter on Slide 5, which collectively totaled $620 million pretax or $1.49 of EPS. First, we recognized an FDIC special assessment of $387 million, which is reflected in other expenses. Second, we recognized $203 million of net repositioning charges to enable the next phase of our productivity program. As we had indicated in December, the bulk of this action primarily relates to severance of around 1,500 employees. Our initiative to streamline and delayer our operations, technology and staff functions and improve efficiency will allow us to sustainably reduce expenses. We expect these actions collectively to have a payback of roughly six quarters and begin this quarter with roughly two-thirds of the benefit occurring in 2024. These actions and the related savings will contribute to our fee operating leverage goal for 2024 and in subsequent years. Turning to Slide 6. I will begin my review of both our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As you can see on the table, total fee revenue was flattish for all periods of comparison quarter-on-quarter, the year-on-year quarter and for the full year. The slight market appreciation, notwithstanding the combination of muted volatility, central bank pivot and geopolitical concerns, pushed investors to the sidelines for much of the year. In terms of our more durable revenues, we continue to benefit from strong momentum in our front office software and data business, which was up 5% on a full year basis and 13% on the year-on-year quarter. In terms of areas that have begun to rebound, management fee performance was down for the full year at minus 3%, but has begun to rebound with an up 5% result for the year-on-year quarter as flows picked up and we gained share. Back office servicing fees was challenged for much of the year as the client's transactional activity was muted but has started to turn positive and is up 1% this quarter as we've seen a recent lift in equity markets. And of course, we continue to be affected by industry wide headwinds in our global markets businesses, given the low levels of volatility in the FX markets and specials activity in agency lending throughout the year. NII has been tough to predict and surprise to the part of this quarter compared to third quarter. I'll turn to that in a few minutes. Expenses were well controlled in the quarter as we continue to thoughtfully allocate resources across the franchise and to areas where we see the greatest opportunities for top line growth. Relative to the year ago, total expenses ex-notables were up 2% year-on-year and reflect intensifying cost management in a tough environment as the year progressed. This expense control, coupled with the repositioning actions I just mentioned, prepare us to deliver productivity savings and positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Finally, despite a dynamic and challenging operating environment, we delivered full year 2023 EPS growth of 3% excluding notable items. This was supported by share repurchases, a record level of NII and the growth for our front office software and data business, which is less exposed to macroeconomic conditions. Turning now to Slide 7. We saw period end AUC/A increase by 14% on a year-on-year basis and 4% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end market levels and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased primarily due to higher period end market levels. At Global Advisors, period end AUM increased 19% year-on-year and was up 12% sequentially, largely reflecting higher period end market levels and strong net inflows. Notably, as Ron mentioned earlier and I'll describe momentarily, in fourth quarter, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate net flows of $103 billion, which sets us up well for 2024. At the center right, we've also added a table of market volatility indices, which we believe can be useful indicators of client transactional activity that drives servicing fees, specials activity in agency lending and flows in margins and FX trading. On Slide 8 now. On the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average equity markets, partially offset by pricing headwinds, lower client activity and adjustments and a previously disclosed client transition. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 2%, primarily as a result of the pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed net client transition, partially offset by higher client activity and adjustments, which was nice to see as clients started to come off the sidelines. On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. We were quite pleased to see new servicing fee revenue wins of $103 million this quarter, the highest in many recent years, primarily reflecting the enhancements to our sales processes and product offerings, including in North America where we saw strong outcomes after a period of underperformance. These servicing wins contributed to the total full year fee revenue wins of $301 million and underscores the progress we're making towards stronger sales performance. Recall, our goal for 2024 is even higher at $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee sales for the year. Finally, we had $270 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end, up $57 million year-on-year and $15 million quarter-on-quarter. We expect about half of this to install in 2024. We also had $2.3 trillion of AUC/A to be installed at period end. Turning to Slide 9. Fourth quarter management fees were $479 million, up 5% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and some performance fees, partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impact of a strategic product suite repricing initiative that has aided ETF flows. Relative to the third quarter, management fees were flat, mainly driven by higher performance fees, offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impacts of the strategic ETF product suite repricing initiatives. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broad based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETF, we had record quarterly net inflows of $68 billion, driven by record net inflows into SPY as well as the SPDR portfolio US low cost suite experiencing consistent market share gains. In our institutional business, we saw quarterly net flows of $6 billion, primarily driven by defined contribution products. And lastly, across our cash franchise, we saw quarterly cash net inflows of $29 billion, primarily into money market funds, which contributed to the record total full year 2023 cash net inflows of $76 billion and institutional money market fund market share gains. Turning now to Slide 10. Fourth quarter FX trading services revenue was down 11% year-on-year ex-notables and 2% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower FX spreads from muted market volatility offset by slightly higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the decrease primarily reflects lower direct FX revenues from muted volatility. Fourth quarter securities finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower agency balances, partially offset by higher agency spreads, higher specials activity and prime services revenue. Moving on to software and processing revenues. Fourth quarter fees were up 10% year-on-year and 26% sequentially, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Finally, other fee revenue for the quarter increased $15 million year-on-year, primarily due to a midyear tax credit investment accounting change, partially offset by the impact associated with the devaluation of the Argentinian peso. Moving to Slide 11. You'll see on the left panel that fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased 13% year-on-year, primarily as a result of the continued SaaS implementations and conversion, driving software enabled and professional services revenue growth. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was up 38%, primarily driven by higher on premise renewals and go live implementations. Turning to some of the Alpha business metrics on the right panel. We're pleased to report four more Alpha mandate wins in the quarter, which means seven wins for the full year 2023. State Street Alpha continues to be an important differentiator of our business and creates an attractive value proposition for our clients with contractual terms usually covering five to seven, to 10 years. We've also gone live with three more Alpha clients which brings us to six for the year, which sets us up well for 2024, and added significant new functionality for fixed income portfolio managers. Fourth quarter ARR increased 16% year-over-year, driven by 20 plus SaaS client implementations and conversions, and we had a record quarter for front office new bookings at $32 million. Turning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII increased 14% year-on-year but increased 9% sequentially to $678 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to lower average deposit balances and deposit mix shift, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by the impact of interest rates and the full quarter impact of the third quarter investment portfolio repositioning, as well as higher deposits and loan balances. The NII results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected, as both interest bearing and non-interest bearing deposits increased and certain client repricings were further delayed. Some of the higher deposit balances may have been seasonal but the Fed's quantitative tightening appears to have been offset by the reduction of the Fed's Reverse repo operation, which seems to have resulted in clients leaving higher bank deposit balances. It's hard to know how deposits will trend but we are pleased with this higher step-off going into the first quarter of 2024. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during fourth quarter. Average deposits increased 4% quarter-on-quarter with non-interest bearing deposits up 3% for the quarter. Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 2% year-on-year or 1% ex-FX. Sequentially, fourth quarter expenses were up only 1% as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, Private Markets, Core Custody and tech and ops process improvements and automation. On a line-by-line basis and year-over-year, ex-notables, compensation employee benefits increased 1%, primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by lower contractor spend and performance based incentive comp. Information systems and communications expenses increased 4%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and vendor credits. Transaction processing increased 1%, mainly reflecting higher brokerage costs. Occupancy increased 24%, largely due to the absence of an episodic sale leaseback transaction in the prior period. And other expenses were up 3% sequentially, flat year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher marketing spend and professional fees. Lastly, let me spend a moment on headcount. As we discussed in the third quarter, as part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we have streamlined our operating model in India and have now assumed full ownership of one of our operations joint ventures, and we recently announced that we intend a similar undertaking with a second consolidation in the country this spring. This consolidation continues the transformation of State Street's global operations and will enable us to unlock productivity savings, which we expect to start this quarter through a reduction in contractor services and in the years ahead as we simplify our fragmented operating model. As you would expect, consolidating the first joint venture increased our FTE headcount roughly 4,400 in the quarter as we in sourced global capabilities. However, these costs were already in our expense base and reported historically under the comp and benefits line. These actions are contributing to our higher productivity savings targets for 2024. Moving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels, which came in above both our internal targets and our regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.6% was up 60 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by episodically lower RWA and improvement in AOCI, partially offset by the continuation of common share repurchases. The decrease in interest rates during December after the completion of our buyback contributed about 20 basis points to our CET1 ratios. And some market factors over the last week of December conveniently contributed roughly another 50 basis points to the RWA end of period print. Going forward, I would expect RWA to run at higher levels to support our various businesses. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 106% and 122% for State Street Bank & Trust. In the quarter, we were quite pleased to return over $700 million to shareholders, consisting of $500 million of common share repurchases over $200 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as we announced earlier today, our Board authorized a new multiyear common equity repurchase program of up to $5 billion with no expiration date. Turning to Slide 15. Before I start, let me first share some of the assumptions and underlying our current views for the full year. Let me cover our full year 2024 outlook, as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have more potential for variability than usual given the macroeconomic environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect global equity markets to be flat point to point in 2024, which equates to the daily average being up about 10% year-over-year. Our interest rate outlook for 2024 largely aligns with the forward curve as of year end 2023, which I would note continues to move. We expect to see modest increase in FX and equity volatility, which should support slightly higher FX trading services fees this year, but we are still seeing muted volatility in the first quarter. And we expect currency translation to have less than 0.5 percentage point impact on revenues and expenses due to dollar depreciation. And I would remind you that a weaker US dollar has a favorable impact on revenues and an unfavorable impact on expenses. So we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be up approximately 3% to 4% ex-notable items with servicing fee and management fee growth driven by higher market levels and continued business momentum and continued strong growth in front office software and data. This includes a headwind of a little less than 1 percentage point to fee growth from the expected previously disclosed client transition. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, we currently expect fee revenue to be up 2% on a year-over-year basis with servicing fees expected to be up 1%, management fees up 7% to 8% and front office software and data expected to be up over 20%, largely due to increased SaaS new business and conversions and on-premise renewals. We expect full year 2024 NII to be down about 10% on a year-over-year basis compared to a record 2023. This is dependent on the outcome of global rate cuts and deposit mix and levels, which are obviously difficult to predict. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, after a significant step up in 4Q '23, we expect 1Q '24 NII to be flat to down 3% on a sequential quarter basis given current deposit mix expectations. Turning to expenses. As you can see on the walk on Page 16, we expect full year expenses ex-notables will be up about 2.5% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven largely by our continued investment in the business, which we expect to largely offset through greater productivity savings worth $0.5 billion, which is approximately 1.7 times last year's gross savings level. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be up 1% to 1.5% on a year-over-year basis, keeping in mind that seasonal expenses usually occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, we expect to achieve positive fee operating leverage, excluding notable items for full year 2024, given the projected growth in fee revenue and well controlled expenses. Finally, we expect taxes should be in the 21% to 22% range for 2024. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Let me share with you the texture we have. But I'll just say deposits and deposit levels continue to be volatile, they surprise to the upside. And in particular, we saw a nice uptick in deposits into September, October, we actually saw, on the NIB side, a downtick in November and then a large uptick again in December. So the averages came in up for the quarter, which made a big difference. $1 billion of NIB for a month is worth $5 million and you kind of multiply through and that quickly adds up as we had a spread in December of $5 billion, $6 billion relative to our expectations. And at the same time, we also saw interest bearing deposits up. Now some of that is just our regular way engagement with clients, some of that is there leaving more deposits with us. And I think you did see, in the Fed reports, the banking system deposits are up 1%, 2% quarter-on-quarter from third quarter to fourth quarter. So it does seem like there's something happening in the market that's creating a little more stability, a little bit of buoyancy. There's some amount of seasonality that we always tend to see at the end of the year as folks accumulate cash, sometimes to pay dividends and ETFs in the next year. So it's just hard to read but that's what played out. And it played out better through the quarter and through the end. If I then try to look forward, it's very hard to look forward for the year. And we'd like to operate and expect to operate in the deposit range of $200 billion to $210 billion, that's our kind of goal. A lot of that is just client engagement and helping put their cash to work. And sometimes they put cash to work in deposits, in repo, in money market sweeps. But there's a category -- each one of those is an important category and outlet for clients. And what we're seeing is clients using all the, I'll call it, all the above, right, including just holding treasury securities. So that we expect to continue and we think deposits will be roughly in this zone in the first quarter. What's a little harder to read is just how noninterest bearing deposits play out. We do expect those to continue to float downward. They tend to float downward for our clients with the largest funds, those are the ones that have been floating down over the last two years. So we continue to see that expectation. There continues to be a little bit of repricing that plays out into the first quarter too as well. And that's why I guided on an NII basis to flat to down 3% for the first quarter, just to give you a little bit of an indication, but we expect that to be roughly on flattish deposits. Alex, it's an important topic, because it's how we interact with our clients, it's how we price our products, it's how the industry has operated in for many years. I think you know that our deposit betas on a cumulative basis have climbed quite a bit in the US. They're 75% or so cumulatively since the start of the cycle. In euros, it's around 60% cumulatively in pound sterling, closer to 30% to 35%. So they're clearly moved up. What certainly happens as, and I'll say when, if and when rates fall, is the deposits -- beta is reverse, there's some amount of symmetry. Now they reverse instantaneously, we want to be careful with our clients, we want to be fair. But we do think that over multiple quarters and certainly over any realistic time frame, the Fed cuts and there's got to be an adjustment. Now part of that happens because we have a good bit of our deposits that are indexed to market, they're indexed to market indicators. There are quite a few that are indexed with a spread and then there are a small amount now that has a transactional kind of, I'll call it, administered feature. But you'll generally see a broad amount of symmetry in deposits down versus up. I think what you do need to keep in mind is that our asset sensitivity and liability sensitivity, though, are somewhat different between international markets and in the US, right? In international markets, because those cumulative betas are still in the 30% to 60% range, we're still asset sensitive. So we make more money with increases in rates. And we actually -- NII will trim down with decreases in rates. And that's where we're most -- that's our interest rate sensitivity today. On the US, we have a slight positive bias towards being liability sensitive, but it's still relatively slight. I'd almost call it neutral. So part of what we're doing is just navigating this interest rate environment. It's not exactly clear when the rates come, it's not clear whether the US cuts before Europe or vice versa. And part of what we'll do is actively manage our portfolios to try to take advantage of what's coming. At the same time, we'll price our deposits fairly and prudently. I think you've got the right general pattern framed in the area of NII. Clearly, we have very strong step off in particular, in December, but in the fourth quarter, which will flow into first quarter, and then we expect a trending down. We had a couple of -- well, probably earlier last year, so a couple of quarters ago, I described an NII range of $550 million to $600 million. And we think we'll get into that range, the top end of that range by around the third quarter. But it's a little bit hard to know the exact shape. We just -- but you've got the right direction of travel. And then we expect some stabilization in the second half of next year, maybe around the top half, the middle half of that range, just really hard to tell exactly where and when. If you step back and ask, what are the underlying drivers? There are really three drivers that continue to be important. In terms of tailwinds, we continue to have long rates playing through the portfolio and the investment portfolio balances as they recoupon at higher rates, that's particularly important in the first half of the year, a little less so in the second half of the year, but that continues through as a positive. You then have, as you mentioned, short rates starting to come down. And because of our sensitivity position across the global markets, that does start to have a headwind impact on NII as those cuts continue to come through. Now we'll see what's the pattern and pace of US versus international cuts. And I think right now, we've pegged to the forward, which shows a lot of consistency in symmetry but we'll see if that really happens, because you can see inflation expectations keep moving around literally daily, weekly. And then the third feature is just client deposits and mix. And while we expect client deposits to be in that zone of $200 million, $210 million, they might bump up above that, a little below that, but they'll be in that broad zone. The mix will continue to shave down out of noninterest bearing over the next quarter or two, we think, it's hard to, again, to predict and then there's -- we're working through the final stages of some of our interest bearing deposit, repricing, those seem to have taken a little longer in some cases than we expected. That's okay, that means we accrete income. But those continue to come through and they'll still play through in the first quarter or two as well. And then that's what kind of brings us to some level of reasonable stability in the back half of the year. I'd just add privates has been a real strong area of growth for us. We've described it as up 10%, 15% in different quarters. So it's a big part of our growth agenda as we -- this past year. And then this coming year, as we take our sales, goals up, the $350 million to $400 million at least a quarter of that plus is going to be around private, and that's what's going to help us continue to drive privates growth. We think in the 15% plus range in terms of year-on-year revenues. So it's an area that I think we've actually broadly with both large and small and midsize, it's actually well distributed and it's got a good mix of US, Europe and Asia sales coming through as well. I take a sigh when I think about this question. I think the predictability is partly around Fed actions, right? This is the highest rate level that we've seen in 22 years. And also if I go back a couple of years, the lowest rate level we've probably seen in two decades as well, right? So we've kind of -- we're at these wide bookends relative to really since the -- I want to say, the turn of the century, right, and that's really created this volatility. Can we manage that and mitigate? Well, we do try to sustain on a regular basis, match off deposit, deposit tenor, rate characteristics with the asset side of the portfolio and we do that with duration. The challenge is if you take too little duration, you have even more volatility. If you have to take too much duration on the asset side of the portfolio, you've got more AOCI risk, and so our tools to stabilize work up to a point and then have some negative implications. So I don't really see a way to turn what we'd like to have -- I don't see a way to turn this into just a flywheel of metronome that moves at a certain pace, and it's just a feature of what we do. And part of it is our institutional deposits have somewhat more asset sensitivity or liability sensitivity to rates relative to a very simple regional bank. So we'll tend to have a little more, but that's part of the industry, I think we're in line with peers. The way I'd describe it is we've got a natural roll-off in that portfolio. It's about $5 billion a year. So it sort of plays out and that's related to the maturity in the latter, so that will come down over the next couple of years. As that happens, because as you say, it's at a lower coupon relative to our average, right? Our average portfolio yields are in the 3.5 range. There's real pickup that comes through that line. At least for the next couple of quarters, I guess, is probably for the next couple of years even, because once rates stabilize, we do think that we'll also get some steepness in the yield curve and that will help through. So there are some benefits coming that way. It's also a portfolio that obviously will insulate us from rate moves. I don't think in the next few years, this is the last down cycle versus up cycle then that we'll see and so it will serve its purpose then as well. Yes. Let me maybe describe it in a couple of ways, because 3% to 4% is for the overall franchise. We think that there are some areas of the franchise that will be higher and in some cases, a good bit higher than that. Asset Management, very geared towards the equity markets and the 10% tailwind in equity markets, comes through on literally half of that tends to the right through the asset management fee line, and then the flows that we talked about earlier in the call provide a nice tailwind. So we need to see how markets play through. But the combination of those two, which is exactly how the business is designed, it's market based and it's flow based, will be healthy. I think software and data processing, we've historically said high single digits, sometimes low double digits. If you look at the last couple of years, you're at the 9%, 10% average full year growth. And we've got good visibility there, part of that is Alpha and part of that is outright software and data sales, and so that's strong. I think at the other bookend, servicing fees will come in -- it will be a bit below the 3% to 4%, now some of that is core organic net new business that we need to drive, which is why we've reshaped and tuned that area, in particular on the sales and how we go to market. You're seeing some of the benefits there and how we measure ourselves. We're being very conscious there. But one of the reasons that one will be lower this coming year is that we had that previously announced transition coming through, which will mute some of what we'd like to see. And then the markets activities, we're hoping will be somewhere in the middle of the range, whether FX trading and sec finance. I think what plays out behind the market dependent areas and sometimes why we don't need is around client -- what we describe as client activity, how much transactional activity, whether our clients are on the sidelines or whether they're all in, that this past year on the servicing fees which are half of our fees, that was worth 2 to 3 percentage points of servicing fee headwind. I mean that literally. So you do the math, that's worth $100 million, $150 million of headwind because we don't have those -- that activity, the transactional activity in derivatives, in international custody, which is very, very valuable to us. So part of what plays through is these macroeconomic features, equity bond markets on one hand, you've got client, the kind of risk-on risk-off sentiment, I think, is important. You've got volatility levels in FX and agency lending. And so those we have to live through and navigate through, and sometimes those will come in more strongly and sometimes less. And then I think finally, the piece that we do need to deliver on, Steve, is the part that we can control, which is sales, it's retention. And we've been very clear about our goals and our targets very purposely, because that's where we think we need to hold ourselves particularly accountable and where you can hold us accountable. And there's a version of goals and targets in servicing, we spent a little extra time there. But if you go through our line of businesses, we've got similar kinds of goals area by area and that's on us to deliver, which will help power us through. But the cyclical elements will still come and go. Let me see how -- let me try to describe this to you in a couple of ways and to be helpful. At this point, on a quarterly run rate basis, and I say that very specifically, we're about halfway through the transition, including a piece that came out in the fourth quarter. So we're halfway through on a quarterly run rate basis. We also, though, have to think about it on a fiscal year-on-year basis. And the way I would describe it on a fiscal year-on-year basis, remember, we said this was worth about 2 percentage points of total fees, that's what we've disclosed in our Qs and Ks. About a quarter of that fiscally has come out through the end of '23, about half of it will come out through '24 and about another quarter in '25, so it just takes time to play through. And so we did include that headwind in the first quarter '24 versus first quarter '23 guide, and it is important to that guide. And so our guide includes that and you've got the net guide as a result. No, what I said is that we think we'll operate in the $200 billion to $210 billion range in the first quarter, second, through the year. We expect that to be where we land. I think in fourth quarter on average, right? Remember, we also, I think, talked a little bit about the months, we talked there's end of period data, which is very volatile. But on average, we ended up at, I think, around $207 billion for the quarter in 4Q. And so we think roughly flattish deposits into 1Q. It's just hard to tell, there's seasonality at year end, there tends to be a low point in February, and then you've got cash building for tax purposes into March. But I'd call it flattish in the scheme of things but with a range around that. My instinct on this is NIB will begin to stabilize sometime in 2024, we think sometime in the by the middle of the year or third quarter. You've kind of, at that point, I'll call it, burn through the largest accounts, those are the ones that kind of on a -- since its peak are down 75% in NIB. The smallest accounts are down by about 25% since the peak and those were seeing stabilize more and more. So I think we'll see some stability in NIB because clients and funds and fund boards have made their decisions, especially the ones that have $1 million or $2 million in an account, some of them just don't want to deal with the tax reporting, and so you'll get to some stabilization. So we think that will kind of stabilize. I think the broader question on NII will then come with how, what -- well, and at that point, I think deposit betas kind of tend to stabilize as well. So I think at that point, in the second half of next year, the real question is what is the direction of interest rates on the front end. So very important question, which is what's going to -- where is the long end going to go? And where is the long end going to go in the US versus in the international markets. And that is particularly important to the banking sector because with some amount of steepness in the yield curve, and it's hard to remember when we've had steepness, it's been a while, some amount of steepness in the yield curve is quite accretive to NII, and you expect in a good economy to have some. And so that will be a feature. So there's a series of elements that will come through, and it's hard to I think, to, as a result, predict too precisely. Let me describe it in a couple of different ways. We're all -- every bank tries to manage RWA just because it's part of our capital requirements and returns. And we try to report it carefully and we do it fully to the rules, as you'd expect. What tends to create the volatility because it's a spot measure, it's a one day of the quarter, one out of 90-day measure is the market factors. So if you've got an FX, or in any of the trading businesses if you've got a forward book or even a vanilla derivative book, you've got counterparty exposures, you've got -- that are affected in particular by the currency pairs. And as those move around in the last week of the quarter, you might be in the money or out of the money in those positions and those directly because of how to standardize RWA mathematics were just goes right through RWA. So that could create a swing of $4 billion, $5 billion on the size of our RWAs. Our RWAs is about 100 -- we printed around $112 billion, about half of that is in the markets area. And so there's a good bit of variability, and that's literally what happens. And so sometimes it will end up low, sometimes it will end up high. If you look at Page 14 of the presentation matures, you'll see low point of $107 billion a year ago in RWA, you'll see a higher point of $118 billion last quarter and quite a bit of that is driven by just those market factors playing through into the calculations that we have. And then in addition to that, if you're on a loan book like we do, you'll have overdrafts, overdrafts take RWA as well. And so we also saw some amount of benefit there this quarter. I think the way I would describe the go-forward view is that we ended up particularly low this quarter. We said it could be $6 billion, $7 billion lower than expected. What would par be, maybe I'll describe it that way, going forward, it might be $118 billion, it might be $120 billion. But you've got to put plus $5 billion, minus $5 billion band around that. And so what we want to do is we want to gently continue to reinvest capital into our businesses, because these FX businesses now that we have, have good returns. We've managed them well, they've got 10%, 12% returns in many cases. The securities finance businesses typically are high single digit return businesses, but that's healthy and it's very connected to the servicing and the administrative fee business that we have and important to our clients. And so our view is that these are ways for us to solidify and expand and deepen our relationship with clients. And so we'll gently add RWA each year. How much do we add? We add a few billion dollars, $3 billion to $5 billion of more RWA each year perhaps. But there'll be some volatility around that. And that will be a part of the way we drive our organic growth. We're a high return bank, that's for sure. But we do want to put some of our capital to work for core organic growth reasons. The background here is that the industry has evolved, I would say, pre-CCAR, which is a long time ago, there used to be open ended authorizations in the banking sector. Once we got into CCAR, remember, there was a very defined annual amount of buybacks that you had to submit. In fact, you had to submit the first year and the second year and there was a lot of -- making sure that what you submitted within the Fed CCAR process was actually what you did, because wanted to keep consistency with that. And so the industry moved towards quite a bit of disclosure on a one year basis as a result. And if you recall, a lot of those one year disclosures happened right after CCAR was announced at the -- either at the end of June or in the second quarter earnings in July. What we've seen as we've scanned at least the banking, our peer banks, the G-SIBs, the large US regionals is now that CCAR is -- it's still an annual process, but it's really with the SCB and some of the refinements to it, it's really an ongoing process. And what we've realized is that I'd say more than three quarters of our peers, you probably know, have actually moved to open ended programs over the last year, year and a half. And so we just wanted to conform to that. As a result, this one is multiyear, it's open ended and we'll take it from there. Mike, let me describe it this way. The headline that we've previously disclosed for the ANPR as it's written is Basel RWA increase for us at about 15%. So that's what we've shared. I think what we said at the time and we actually believe even more so now is that it will come in at a portion of that. There's been lots of discussion around, for example, energy tax credits, some of the arcane parts of Basel and how that impacts public policy mortgages, which were not really affected on. There's much more discussion about operational risk literally over the last few months and that would make us quite optimistic that the increases would be relatively small. So we've not updated it because it's just there's a menu out there, but we're encouraged. We think the regulators are trying to navigate public policy on one hand and the right level of capital in the banking system. But we think that the direction of the discussions, in particular, over the last few months are constructive. It's something that we continue to think about. I think every bank continues to think about, we included. We're just continuing to just work through how do we feel about the rate levels that we're at, in particular up on the curve. We are conscious of that, both in the US and in the international areas. We've got positions in pounds sterling and euros and so forth. So we'll just continue to evaluate it. I think as you indicated from your question, part of the reason we repositioned last year in the third quarter was around rate position. We thought it was a very good entry point. In retrospect, we timed that quite well. So we were quite pleased. And I think we felt like we came out ahead economically with the trade because we remember, we took out some bonds but also reinvested both in the belly of the curve and overnight. So that was constructive. And we'll also keep an eye on -- we don't have a lot of capital intensive securities, we've always had a very vanilla book. So there's not an enormous capital motivation, but we'll selectively look at it and see if it might make sense. But I think we're like many others, it's one of the things we keep an eye on. I would just add that we've got a pretty industrial productivity plan for this year. Part of that was the repositioning that we announced, but two thirds of the roles impacted are really around delayering and simplifying State Street. We're actually taking our spans of control in some areas like operations from 5:1 to 8:1. We're taking standard controls in the business and staff functions in some cases from 3:1 to 5:1. And the benefit of that is it actually brings our teams, our client teams and operational teams even closer to our clients. And some of what we're doing with the joint venture consolidation is a catalyst for that because, in some cases, we had too many hand offs and now we can simplify processes and again, bring them closer to our clients. So there's some real structural changes there. And what we do want to do is make sure we see those through. As Ron mentioned, there's always a little more, we'll look at on the margin but we want to be careful. We want to do this right. But on the margin, you continue to work on vendors and so forth, you look at performance based incentive compensation, there are always other smaller levers. But we're pretty -- I think we've got a nice work set out and a lot to do. And I think we've got real confidence that this is, I think, year probably five. I don't think we name our programs with annual versions. But this is probably a year five of productivity program and should really deliver quite a bit. Why don't we follow up off-line, Rob, just send it through to Ilene and the team."

O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier today we released our third quarter financial results. As we issued these results, the world has witnessed a surprise and unconscionable terrorist attack on innocent Israeli citizens and the resulting enormous human toll in Israel and Gaza. These terrible events have shocked the world and created further global geopolitical uncertainty. State Street stands with the people of Israel and we are united with all those impacted. Now turning to the third quarter, global financial market performance was mixed as a positive start for equity markets in July turned decisively negative as the quarter progressed. Against the backdrop of softening economic data, market sentiment was negatively impacted by continued global central bank rate hikes and investor concerns of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment in an economic hard landing. As a result, equities fell, while global bond yields continued climbing around the world, reaching levels not seen for many years with the US 10-year yield reaching its highest level since 2007. Despite these factors, the third quarter continued to be characterized by relatively low currency market volatility. Turning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation, I will review our third quarter highlights before Eric take -- takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, third quarter earnings per share was $1.25 or $1.93, excluding a loss on sale from an investment portfolio repositioning, which was a notable item in 3Q. EPS growth year-over-year, excluding notable items was driven by our significant common share repurchases during the period, coupled with a 3% increase in total fee revenue. This fee revenue growth reflects higher servicing and management fees, better front office software and data fees, and an increase in other fee revenue. Taken together, the benefit of share repurchases and the improvement in fee revenue more than offset lower NII, market headwinds within trading businesses, as well as the impact of year-over-year expense growth. That said, we are pleased with our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, which help us to contain that expense growth, while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses. Turning to our business momentum, within Investment Services, total AUC/A increased to $40 trillion at quarter end and we recorded $149 billion of new asset servicing wins during the third quarter, largely driven by wins in Official Institutions and Private Markets. The estimated annual new servicing fee revenue to be recognized in future periods associated with 3Q asset servicing wins amounted to $91 million, which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in over two years, demonstrating our ability to achieve our ambition of driving stronger sales performance. Encouragingly, Alpha's momentum continued in 3Q. We deepened relationships with existing mandates and recorded two new Alpha mandate wins, including our first Alpha for Private Markets mandate for one of the world's most influential investors. During the third quarter, we outlined a number of strategic focus areas for our Investment Services franchise, as we aim to drive opportunities across key regions and product areas and realize the full potential of our State Street Alpha value proposition. Importantly, we are taking actions aimed at gaining market share in reinvigorating revenue growth. We are executing against our plan to improve core back-office custody sales performance as it is our largest revenue pool installed quickly has significant scale and drives high-margin ancillary revenues. As an illustration of our custody sales momentum and the power of Alpha. In the third quarter, State Street in Vontobel, a premier global asset manager headquartered in Switzerland, entered into an agreement to expand our existing front and middle office relationship, by providing back-office services, subject to necessary approvals. State Street had no relationship with Vontobel until discussions began in 2020 around Alpha, resulting in the adoption of our front, middle and now back office services. Key client wins such as Vontobel, demonstrate how Alpha can establish, broaden, and deepen client relationships, further positioning State Street as our client's essential partner. It illustrates the value of the Alpha proposition and confirms our strategic rationale of how Alpha can grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's capabilities in a true one State Street solution for our clients, from front to back. Accelerating the sales cycle and implementation timeline, particularly back-office services remains an important strategic priority to drive even more fee revenue growth. Turning to our front office software and data businesses. CRD continues to perform well and has a strong pipeline. By the end of the third quarter, annual recurring revenue for our front office software and data business increased by 12% year-over-year to $299 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management reached $3.7 trillion at quarter end, supported by a record $41 billion of net cash inflows in 3Q. Importantly, our cash business gained market share in an expanding market, driven by strong investment performance coupled with a higher yield environment. In aggregate, Global Advisors gathered $10 billion of total net inflows in 3Q. Record quarterly flow performance in cash was partially offset by outflows in the institutional business, coupled with the impact of risk-off market sentiment in our ETF business in 3Q. While our ETF franchise saw modest net outflows in aggregate in 3Q, our US low-cost SPDR ETF franchise continues to be a bright spot, generating $7 billion of net inflows, gaining further market share. To drive continued growth, in 3Q we reduced the price on 10 low-cost SPDR portfolio ETFs, demonstrating our commitment to delivering institutional quality investment solutions at competitive price points. Lastly, on business momentum. I am proud to highlight that State Street's foreign exchange business has once again been recognized as the industry leader. After being ranked number one FX provider to asset managers by Euromoney Magazine in 2022, this year Euromoney Magazine’s 2023 FX Awards named State Street as the winner across four categories, including Best FX Bank for Real Money Clients, Best FX Bank for Research, Best FX Venue for Real Money Clients, and Best FX Bank Sales. Turning to our financial condition, State Street's balance sheet, liquidity and capital positions remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 11% at quarter end, well above our regulatory minimum. This strength has enabled us to deliver against our goal of capital return to our shareholders. In 3Q, we returned $1.2 billion of capital, buying back $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means that cumulatively over the last four quarters to the end of September, we have returned approximately $5.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends. As we look ahead in the fourth quarter, it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases, under our existing authorization of up to $4.5 billion for 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, amidst the challenges of the market environment in 3Q, we remain dedicated to driving stronger business momentum and improving fee growth. To that end, in the third quarter, we outlined our sharpened execution plan to the Investment Services business, underpinned by a number of actions aimed at accelerating sales and revenue growth, while simultaneously improving the discipline in accountability for this execution. Our laser-focused on expense discipline also remains high. We have a well-established track record of reengineering our processes and transforming our operations to improve our efficiency and realize productivity growth. In the third quarter, we reduced expenses quarter-over-quarter, and announced another step in our multi-year productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model, while enabling even greater investment in our business. As part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we are streamlining our operations in India, we have now assumed full ownership of one of our joint ventures in the country. This consolidation will continue the transformation of State Street's global operations and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.25, which was down year-on-year due to the impact of the $294 million loss on sale in connection with the repositioning of our investment portfolio, which will benefit NII in the future periods. EPS was up year-on-year at $1.93, excluding the repositioning, which you can see on the right-hand side of the page. Turning to the core business, as you can see on the left panel of the slide, total fee revenue grew by 3% year-on-year, driven by growth in our front, middle and back office investment services business, as well as solid management fee performance at Global Advisors. This performance enabled us to offset some of the industry-wide headwinds we saw in our Global Markets business as well as lower NII, given the mixed macroeconomic backdrop in the quarter. Lastly, we remain focused on managing costs in the current operating environment, limiting expense growth to just 3% this quarter and achieving productivity savings as part of our plan to deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Turning now to Slide 5. We see -- we saw a period-end AUC/A increase by 12% on a year-on-year basis and 1% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period-end equity market levels and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased primarily due to client flows and net new business. While net new business was positive, long-term flows in the asset management industry has been muted, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. This risk-off sentiment leads to the current headwind across the servicing industry. At Global Advisors, period-end AUM increased 13% year-on-year and was down 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the increase was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels and inflows of $10 billion. Notably in the quarter, our cash franchise continued to perform strongly, generating a record $41 billion of net inflows, as our competitive performance contributed to market share gains. Quarter-on-quarter AUM increase mainly due to lower quarter-end market level. Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see third-quarter servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average equity markets, net new business and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed client transition. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 2% primarily as a result of lower client activity and adjustments in previously -- in a previously disclosed client transition, partially offset by higher average equity markets. As I've mentioned over the past year, we continue to see lower levels of client activity inflows, all of which impact transactional volumes, leading to a 2 percentage point to 3 percentage point headwind on servicing fees year-to-date. Part of this is the cyclical nature of the servicing business. The full-year effect has ranged from minus 2% -- minus 2% to plus 1 percentage point impact over the last five years. Within servicing fees, back office services were generally consistent in total servicing fee -- fees. Middle office services, which is part of the Alpha proposition had another quarter of good growth. On a year-over-year basis, middle office fees were up 3% and up 1% sequentially, largely driven by net new business. On the bottom panel of this page, we highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. We won $149 billion of new AUC/A. We onboarded roughly $250 billion of AUC/A in the quarter, primarily in the asset management client segment. And importantly, as Ron mentioned, we achieved new annual servicing fee revenue wins of $91 million this quarter, which will be recognized in future periods. These servicing wins underscore the progress we're making towards stronger sales performance. While we've historically only described wins in AUC/A terms, we recently expanded our disclosure to indicate that a healthy level of annual servicing sales is in $300 million range this year. You can measure us against this benchmark. We now have about $2.3 trillion of assets to be installed and about $255 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed as well. Turning to Slide 7, third-quarter management fees were $479 million, up 1% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels, partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 4% as a result of higher equity market levels and record quarterly cash net inflows. As you can see on the bottom-right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well-positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, we had neutral overall flows, but saw positive net inflows and consistent market share gains in the SPDR portfolio low-cost suite. As you know, we strategically dropped the fees on about a third of our low-cost suite of products and expect more growth in the coming quarters from this action. In our institutional business, notwithstanding net outflows of $30 billion in the quarter, which were primarily driven by client in-sourcing, both our Defined Contribution and Index Fixed Income products continue to drive strategic momentum. Lastly, across our client franchise, we saw record quarterly cash net inflows of $41 billion as we captured some of the cyclical movement of cash in the financial system. I'll just remind you that cash flows can be volatile quarter-to-quarter. Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter FX trading services revenue was down 2% year-on-year, while up 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower direct FX spreads and lower FX volatility, partially offset by higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the growth primarily reflects higher volumes. Industry volatility is down 25% to 40% across developed markets and emerging markets relative to the period a year ago, and down 5% to 10% sequentially, which is presenting fewer trading opportunities and lower spreads. Securities finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower specials activity and lower agency balances. Sequentially, revenues were down 12%, primarily as a result of seasonally lower activity and the recent industry drop-off of US Equity shoring activity and specials. Third quarter software and processing fees were up 2% year-on-year, but down 15% sequentially, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Other fee revenue increased $49 million year-on-year, primarily due to the tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market related adjustments. Moving to Slide 9, you'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 2% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services revenue, as we continue to convert and implant more clients to the SaaS environment, which now accounts for about 60% of our clients, partially offset by fewer on-premise renewals. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was down 20%, primarily driven by lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by higher software-enabled revenues. Our sales pipeline continues to grow and remain strong for our Charles River Development Front office solutions products. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics in the right panel, we are pleased, we had two more mandate wins in the quarter for Alpha. Most notably, we also had our first Alpha for Private Markets win. We also meaningfully advance CRD's institutional fixed income capabilities. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter NII decreased 5% year-on-year and 10% sequentially to $624 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to the continued mix-shift from non-interest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing, and lower average deposit balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by lower average deposit balances and the deposit mix-shift, partially offset by the benefit of higher interest rates, including international central bank hike and our investment portfolio repositioning. The NII results were somewhat better-than-expected due to non-interest-bearing deposit levels coming down slightly less-than-expected, and the portfolio repositioning, partially offset by client repricing, some of which will be delayed and will impact the fourth quarter instead. On the right of the slide, we showed our average balance sheet during the third quarter, with average deposits declining 4% quarter-on-quarter. Cumulative US dollar client deposit betas were 73% since the start of this recent cycle, while cumulative foreign currency deposit betas for the same period continued to be much lower in the 25% to 50% range. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, last month, we executed an NII accretive and capital accretive investment portfolio repositioning exercise to take advantage of both higher yields and spreads, which all else equal, should drive NII towards the higher end of the previously disclosed range of $550 million to $600 million per quarter next year. Turning to Slide 11. Third-quarter expenses excluding notable items increased 4% year-on-year. Sequentially, third-quarter expenses were down 1% as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in the strategic elements of the company including Alpha, Private Markets and Technology, and Operations Automation. On a line-by-line basis, year-on-year compensation and employee benefits increased 4% primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation, higher headcount, and the impact of currency translation. Sequentially, however, we brought headcounts down and we also reduced incentive compensation this quarter, in line with our year-to-date performance. Information systems and communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, insourcing, and vendor savings initiatives. Transaction processing increased 6%, mainly reflecting higher sub-custody vendor costs. Occupancy increased 4% as we relocated our headquarters building, and other expenses were up 4%, mainly reflecting higher marketing spend and professional fees. Moving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels, which remain above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimum. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11% was down 80 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained earnings. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 109% and 120% for the State Street Bank and Trust. In the quarter, we were quite pleased to return roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders, consistent -- consisting of just over $1 billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year ending September 30th, we repurchased approximately 12% of shares outstanding. Finally, a few brief closing thoughts before turning to outlook. Our third-quarter performance was solid with fee revenue growth of 3% year-on-year. We executed on our plan to improve sales capacity and reported $91 million in new servicing fee wins in the quarter, as we look towards our goal of $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee wins in 2024. And as you've seen us do for the last four years, we again demonstrate expense discipline, while continuing to invest in the business. Next, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding the fourth quarter. At a macro level, our interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards. We currently assume global equity markets will remain flat from now to quarter end, which implies the daily averages down about 3% quarter-on-quarter, bond markets are also expected to be down about 3% on average quarter-on-quarter. Regarding fee revenue in 4Q on a year-over-year basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be flat to up 1% year-over-year, with servicing fees approximately flat, and management fees to also be flattish. As we expect the year-on-year business drivers, similar to what we saw this quarter. We do expect fourth quarter sales momentum to be similar to the strong sales performance we saw in the third quarter. We also expect that our market businesses will be down modestly year-over-year, given lower volatility. We expect software and processing fees to be up 10% to 12%, largely due to the timing of on-prem renewals and the expected new SaaS installations, and we expect the other revenue line to come in at around $30 million to $40 million in the fourth quarter. Regarding NII, we now expect 3Q NII -- we now expect 4Q NII to be towards the middle of the $550 million to $600 million range we previously mentioned. This includes continued expected rotation of about $3 billion to $4 billion out of non-interest-bearing deposits and the impact of deposit pricing, which we previously noted, but with more stability in the total deposit averages. Turning to expenses, we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment and expect to maintain relatively flat expenses in 4Q quarter-over-quarter. As always, this is on an ex-notables basis, and in this regard, we are keeping an eye on the likely FDIC assessment. And we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 4Q will be around 22%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Mr. Alex Bostein from Golden -- Goldman Sachs, sorry. Your line is open.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Thanks, everybody. Hey, Ron and Eric, I was hoping maybe you can touch on your comments earlier around positive fee operating leverage into 2024, which is definitely very encouraging to hear after a couple of years of very good cost management already. So, as you think about the revenue uncertainty between the markets and customer flows, I guess, what is the range of outcomes you're assuming for fees as you look out into 2024? And if revenues prove to be more challenging than the base case, is there enough room to still deliver that positive fee-operating leverage? Thanks.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Yeah, Alex, it's Ron. I mean we're basing that comment largely on two things. One is, we feel like we've got quite good visibility around what we're doing from a cost perspective. So we feel like, we've got a series of initiatives underway that will continue into 2024 on managing our costs, while also continuing the investment program that we've got in place. That investment program includes some investments that will drive revenues in 2024 and beyond. But also the second thing it's based on is some of the actions we've taken around strengthening our sales and sales effectiveness and just pointing to the results we had in Q3, the note that Eric just made to you in terms of the visibility we have on 2024. So those two things, our confidence in expenses and what we believe is a nicely developing pipeline, and it's a set of sales capabilities and processes. I mean, obviously, markets could turn everything upside down, but based on a reasonable market forecast and not necessarily one that's going to be necessarily a tailwind, we do believe we can achieve positive fee operating leverage.\nAlexander Blostein: That's great. And, I appreciate the new disclosure on the backlog and the revenue backlog, definitely helpful. So maybe within that, can you help us maybe understand the cadence of how quickly some of that $255 million of backlog will sort get converted into service and fee revenues? Is that expected largely over the course of 2024 or some of that is going to spill into 2025? And then ultimately, do you think that's going to be enough to offset some of the BlackRock related outflows and revenues that you still expect? Thanks\nEric Aboaf: Alex, it's Eric. Let me answer that from a couple of different directions to give you some texture, because as we think about go-forward fee revenues, right? Part of what matters is installing the backlog. Part of what matters is new sales, right? Sort of maintaining the third quarter momentum to the fourth quarter and into next year, because some of those sales actually come through in the subsequent few quarters. And then, as we talked about back in September, making sure that we're very effective on our retention activities. So every one of those matters. In terms of the backlog, we said there's about $255 million of revenues in the backlog on the -- on servicing fees and north of $2 trillion on an AUC/A basis. The implementation is a little bit different in each of the regards. In terms of revenues, we think about 5%, 10% of that will come through, specifically in the fourth quarter, so that's included in our guide. We expect 50% to 60% of that $255 million to come through next year, and then the balance in 2025. So it's kind of a good mix and aligned with what we'd like. The AUC/A implementation is a little more -- is little quicker. Just sometimes that happens, it's quicker, sometimes slower, that's a little closer to 30% in fourth quarter and around 60% next year, but those will move around as they play out. But we've got good visibility now. And what we've been particularly pleased with on our third quarter sales in particular was that, a lot of that was around back office services. And back office services as you know, are one of the fastest to onboard and implement, and that's going to provide some momentum into the first half of 2024.\nAlexander Blostein: That's great. Thank you very much, both.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Mr. Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKenneth Usdin: Hey guys, good morning. Eric, just one follow-up, the fourth quarter NII you're expecting to be in the middle of that kind of [indiscernible] zone and then you're talking to the upper-end for next year. I just wanted to ask you to walk us through that direction of travel. Like, what are the factors that start to turn to perhaps a slight positive as you exit the year into next year with regard to either -- is either left side repricing or just deposits getting to the right zones, just kind of walk us through the moving parts? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, Ken, it's Eric. As you surmised, there are a number of factors that matters, especially at this point in the cycle. As we transition from declining NII to some level of stabilization, and we see a good rationale for some uptick from fourth quarter into the first quarter of next year. So let me just go through them, right? There is a continued amount of rotation of NIB, non-interest-bearing deposits. We still expect some in the fourth quarter, but we expect that that starts to flatten out at the beginning of next year. We'll see exactly how much and when. It's hard to call and it moves around. We've got quite a bit of visibility into our repricing, especially for our largest and most sophisticated clients, I described that last year. And then we're through a good bit of that. We have -- we execute on some more of it in the third quarter, we expect and we have very good visibility into fourth quarter. And so, the kind of the repricing effects and the catch-up is kind of a bubble that works its way through. On the tailwind side, we then have the investment portfolio rolling through. And the investment portfolio matures $4 billion, $5 billion bonds quarter, you've got the new bonds come on roughly at 200 basis points, sometimes 300 basis points higher than the ones that are maturing. And so, that's what's giving us a positive trajectory. And so it's really those three factors, plus a little bit of lending growth and some of our other actions that we can control that we think starts to shape, a stabilization of NII as we get from fourth quarter to the first quarter, but, it'll depend. There'll be some movements and as you know we update all of you as frequently as we are in public and we'll continue to do that, but those are the trajectories and our expectations at this point.\nKenneth Usdin: Understood. Thanks. And my second one is just the costs were, I think, a little better then you had thought and your flat to 4Q also probably little better than the market thought and a slower implied year-over-year rate of growth. Just wondering, have you done anything incremental to slow the organic growth rate of expenses? And is that something we should think about as we go forward as well?\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Yes, Ken, it's Ron. I mean there's a number of initiatives underway, as we I think always talked about. We've really got an ongoing productivity that have actions underway, that is comprehensively looking throughout the organization. Some of the things that are underway now. We mentioned what's going on in India. And this India JV bringing that inside and this JV goes back to our early days in India, before we had our own Center of Excellence there. It's going to enable us to eliminate redundancy and eliminate a lot of oversight activities. So we'll be able to take down costs there, take down repetitive costs. We've got a comprehensive look at operating model throughout the business, which is, will start to yield results into next year. We're looking at some -- where work gets done throughout the world and are there places where we can move and combine things, create more end-to-end. So it's a series of things. Some of them -- you know a lot of the easy work has already been done. So some of these things have been -- the work's been underway for a while and we'll start to realize the benefits of it. But we see visibility such that we can make the statements that we are that notwithstanding that, we continue to make significant investments in the business that we feel we can keep our cost in reasonable check.\nEric Aboaf: And Ken, I'll just add that the other thing that we have -- we're down on effectively that we talked about over the last quarter or so was our hiring freeze. I mean, what we found is, we've got outstanding individuals and people on our team. And part of what we need to do is, we reinvest in different features of the business or different areas. We actually need to reallocate some of that talent to those areas and actually, at the same time, we need to find efficiencies in others. And so that's been -- well it is -- it is hard work, it's been an effective way to actively manage our team and our human resources. It still means we invest in all that we need to do for new products, functionality, regulatory requirements and so forth. But the reallocation that's born from the -- from this sort of freeze is actually very effective tool for us at this stage in the cycle.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Yes. Ken, what I would add to this, I think what we're talking about now is a continuation of what we started going back to 2019, that was rudely interrupted by COVID and everything that occurred coming out of COVID, the disruption, the great resignation, the issues that arose out of that with service quality and where we needed to overinvest to make up for some of the turnover that we were seeing that led to the kind of cost increase that you saw. That's all been normalized. Service quality has stabilized. And so, I would say that we're back on the path that we started back in 2019, and overcome what we saw in the kind of 2021-2022 period.\nKenneth Usdin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, Ron and Eric, and thanks for taking my questions. One question on your expectations for 4Q, Eric. Encouraging to hear that you still are expecting non-interest-bearing to find a stable point here in the beginning of next year. But when you think about your fourth quarter expectations, are you thinking that the typical seasonality that we see in deposits will come through? And is that embedded within the middle of that range of $550 million to $600 million for NII?\nEric Aboaf: Brennan, it's Eric. Yes, broadly, but with the asterisks of the seasonality that we've seen, it has moved around a bit, sometimes a little stronger, sometimes it's a little weaker than typical. So we do see a bit of an uptick in a normalization in total deposits. And so we'll -- we've guided to stabilization, maybe we'll see an uptick, we'll see. But -- this is based on really quite deep analysis of our client deposit base. Remember, we managed it on the US dollar, we managed on each of the foreign currencies. We have just an NIB, for example, I think we have 30,000 accounts, the average account size is $1 million. We've seen the trends in the largest, most sophisticated client and largest accounts come down quite a bit. The smaller ones tend to have a flatter line and evolution. So the guide is based on that plus a little bit of the seasonality, and we'll just update as we go. But I think we've started to see some amount of inflection here. But we want to be careful, right? There's still some amount of rotation playing out. There's some amount of balances and pricing coming through. A good bit of which we have a visibility into, but it'll take a little time to just work through it in the next few months and quarters.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay, great. Thanks. And then maybe following up a little bit on Ken's question. I'm sure at this point you're going through the budgeting process for 2024. Do you have any preliminary expectations for what you could be looking at for expense growth -- operating expense growth here in the next year?\nEric Aboaf: Brennan, it's early to do that. You know, we -- I think what gives us confidence and actually the feel of necessity on fee operating leverage is, we need to run the business in a way that is healthy for our shareholders and our various stakeholders at the same time and we need to find a way through that. We certainly have gone through a strategic planning exercise. We do that through the summer, July, August, and September, and we have -- we've got our path forward. We believe both on the top-line and on expenses, it's a little soon to get into that. But we're working through that and part of what we're doing now is actually making sure that we have detailed plans, business-by-business, function-by-function. We run alternative scenarios. We even develop contingency plans and we are also -- we are careful about metering out our spend next year, where we do add to spend, we're going to do that with stage gate. So there's a lot going on right now and we'll come back with kind of a full set of guide -- guidelines and guidance in January. But I think -- we're confident that we've got a path forward here that'll be healthy and fee operating leverage is very good way for us to think about it and I think for you guys as well.\nBrennan Hawken: Yeah. Thanks very much, Eric. Appreciate that color.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello. Thank you. So we've discussed over time and today that the lower client flows from the market, the whole active to passive trend, and that how disadvantages kind of all of us. Can you talk about what you're seeing in all private markets, both from a servicing standpoint and you sprinkled in a little comment about Alpha for private markets, like bring this to life a little bit? Could this be a growth industry for the next handful of years, just curious on the side of that. Thanks.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Hey, Glenn, it's Ron. Obviously, you know the kind of growth that the private markets have seen, whether it's private equity and more recently private credit infrastructure and we see none of that abating. Private equity may be taking a bit of a pause, but all of the fundamentals point to those industries increasing, and in fact many of the large -- if you look at some of the large multi-asset managers, a lot of their growth is actually coming from privates. Much of that business today remains in sourced and there's very few standards in the business, a lot of it gets serviced in very expensive locations and is not a very good experience for the ultimate LP investors. So it's a very fast growth area for us. And it becomes more important for the sponsors, for the actual firms to actually get their arms around this, because the average ticket size is going down. 10, 15 years ago, the LP investors, typical LP investor was an institution, it was a pension fund, a sovereign wealth gun fund. Today, the average investor is some affluent person that's in some kind of a pooled fund. And so, getting this all right is actually quite important, and the demand is very high for us. We're investing a lot in it, a lot of technology in it. And increasingly, as these firms become multi asset, not just focused on -- in one area, the idea of an Alpha front to back kind of thing and all that's associated with it -- with data becomes very important, both as providers, but also as investors. So the opportunity here is not just the big private providers, but also the big private investors, the sovereign wealth funds and asset owners here. So yes, we see it as a very significant opportunity for us.\nEric Aboaf: And Glenn, just add a little bit of the kind of quantitative elements of this. Private markets, broadly defined around the world from a servicing fee standpoint are growing in the 9% to 10% a year. We described our performance, which has been quite strong in that area. And based on our client base and our pipeline, our expectation is that, we should be growing in the 15% range next year. Part of that is because we serve so many large global asset managers who have a wide range, both in traditional products and in privates, right? So they're coming to us, and partly because increasingly we're serving the classic alternative and private organizations, right, who increasingly want to focus on what their core investment process is as opposed to processing. And so, we see more and more outsourcing and opportunities for us from that segment as well.\nGlenn Schorr: Maybe just one follow-up to all that good detail. You were early on the -- lot of the offshore outsourcing. You were early on hedge fund outsourcing and it helps you on your growth rate over time. Do you have a sense that you're early here, do you think you have a head start and competitive edge on this private front? We just don't see the same competitive landscape, so curious on your thoughts? Thanks.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: It's a little bit hard to tell, Glenn. I think that we are certainly amongst the traditional asset servicers, we think that were early. You've got some of the very focused fund administrators that do some narrow kinds of activities in there, and certainly in terms of offering a full front to back solution that includes data, as far as we can tell, we're the only ones out there. So yes, we think in general we're early.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay, thank you for all that.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Ryan Kenny from Morgan Stanley. Your line is already opened.\nRyan Kenny: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So the industry has been seeing servicing fee rate pressure for a while. Can you update us on what you're currently seeing in terms of fee rate repricing? And are the newer wins coming in at a lower fee rate than your existing contracts or at a higher fee rate?\nEric Aboaf: Ryan, it's Eric. The overall cadence of fee repricings have been stable for us and I think for the industry the last couple years. As you know, back in 2019, we went through a phase of higher repricings, but they've been relatively consistent in that kind of 2% or so headwind level, which is not that different from what it was over the last five years to 10 years. So that's been relatively stable. What we have seen is very good fee rates on new business. And part of that is the discussion we just had in privates, where just because of the nature of the activity, the servicing, it tends to be a manually intensive process. The fee rates are multiples of the average fee rate for our business. And in fact, the last couple of quarters, we've seen fee rates on new business comfortably above the average that we've seen. You can just do a little bit of comparison and we'd be cautious about doing it for every quarter. But take the last few quarters of AUC/A wins, the last few quarters of fees wins and you kind of -- you get to that view. And we've mentioned that in ways in our quarterly reports this year in particular. So I think in some ways, what we've been able to find is that, with Alpha, we bring more to a client across the AUC/A base, right? So we have fees on the front office side, which we disclose separately, but both the middle and the back office, we have complex clients, and so that's been quite fruitful for us. And then the alternatives and privates is a very -- is a much higher fee rate area, just by virtue of that industry. And that together is what gives us some of the revenue kind of momentum that we've seen into the third quarter of this year and we expect in the fourth quarter as well.\nRyan Kenny: Thanks, that's helpful. And if we look at the quarter, it looks like the servicing fee rate over average AUC/A did come down a bit. Was there anything driving that? Is that just a function of lower volatility and timing, or is there anything else in that number that we should think about?\nEric Aboaf: No, if you just look at the aggregates, remember you've got this kind of effect, where when equity markets are up, right, you kind of have this natural thinning in the fee rate just because of how the fee schedules are structured, right? And they're not -- they're not quite like they are in the asset management business. So no, that's been fairly -- that was expected and in line with the ranges that we've been seeing.\nRyan Kenny: All right, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just actually to follow on that last one, Eric. And just doing the math, just -- and if you can confirm if I'm correct on this, the $91 million over the $149 billion is the appropriate way to look at that and that would be 6 basis points as opposed to the $255 million of servicing revenue to be installed over the $2.3 trillion, representing more than -- just like a basis point or so. So, I guess, first of all, is that -- are we -- am I looking at that correctly and is it all characterized as servicing fee revenue and I guess is what's driving that -- is that differential sort of a sustainable type of new revenue win run rate for, I guess Private Markets sector business?\nEric Aboaf: Brian, it's Eric. I'm really glad you asked that question because with new disclosure comes sometimes very simple answers and sometimes more textured ones. So what you've done is an analysis. If you look at our fee wins divided by our new AUC/A wins, which on average, over time, I'll stress that will approximate the rates that of the win. The challenge is, in any one quarter, remember, some of what we win is on existing AUC/A business. So Ron mentioned one of the global asset managers, we added back office to that relationship. Those AUC/As were already in our base. Why? Because we had already been doing both front and middle office processing for them. So in a way, those fees wins in the quarter cannot be compared to any of the new AUC/A. That's kind of apples and oranges. On the other hand, sometimes the opposite happens, right? Where we might be adding an AUC/A and a fee that's quite high, one that's quite low, because we're just adding a small service and we've had some of those over the last couple of quarters. So I'll just be -- I'll just be cautious about the quarter-by-quarter map. I'd encourage you over time, we can look at that through time. But, I think what we encourage you to do is take a look at the revenue -- the wins on a revenue basis against the base of servicing fees, right, $91 million in the quarter against the $5 billion of servicing fees is a very healthy amount of revenue. And our ability to maintain that momentum gives you an indication of the kind of sales effectiveness and the growth dynamic that we can create net of the retention rates that we need to manage, too. So I'd encourage you to spend the most time there. You can do a little bit AUC/A wins versus the AUC/A base that gives you another indication. But I'd encourage you to do it in that direction, because you'll get a better indication, I think of our momentum.\nBrian Bedell: Okay, that's super helpful. And then the follow-up would be on the deposit beta, the differentials between the US and non-US, and we've heard this from the other custodians as well, in terms of non-US deposit betas being significantly lower than US, and just maybe some thoughts on as we move into this -- into 2024 and potentially Europe, maybe even higher for longer versus US potentially. And should we see more aggressive or I say more incremental deposit beta moving through the non-US markets to sort of almost catch up to US or not so much?\nEric Aboaf: You know, our current indication in, we're well through the cycle in the US, at least we think so, we'll see. It feels like there's little more to go on the international side and it started later, so it's harder to read. We do see that there are some structural differences in the markets around deposit betas between the US currency and the non-dollar, even for the same clients in some cases. And part of that is just the -- you've got this non-interest-bearing versus interest-bearing construct in the US and internationally you can have just an interest-bearing deposit construct. So, it's a little more -- it's a little more straightforward. So as I've described, we have cumulative deposit betas in the US in the 70% to 75% range and we expect that will flowed up a little more as we kind of -- as the cycle, let’s say, finishes, it could go up another 5, 10 percentage points but it’s starting to level off. In Europe, the – we are in the 25% to 50% range of cumulative beta, I think could go up another 10 points, maybe 15 points, we'll see, but it's not going to reach the same level that you have in the US based on the indications we have, and the way we both reprice and we see others competitively price in the market. So, fairly, fairly different between the US and the international currencies. And in some way, that plays to -- that's good for us. We know how to manage in both US and non-US currencies. We've continue to have some tailwinds in NII in the international currencies. We obviously need to make sure that we share some of that with clients, but given the international composition of our balance sheet, that's one of the areas that continues to be supportive of our -- in a positive way of our NII trajectory.\nBrian Bedell: Thanks very much. That's great color. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please proceed.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, I guess, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, on capital, I think I heard you regarding competing up to $4.5 billion in buybacks for the year. Can you give us a sense with the CET1 at 11% close to your target, how are you thinking about capital management going into next year? Would you rather operate with some amount of excess capital as you look forward to some of the macro uncertainties, relative to just continuing buybacks and paying out any excess?\nEric Aboaf: Let me start on that, Ebrahim. We -- it's Eric. Capital is one of the most important elements of the balance sheet and we spend a lot of time thinking about what are the levels of capital? How to manage? It is based on facts and circumstances, right? The economic environment, the uncertainty, our confidence in earnings and earnings momentum, what we can see in the strength of our balance sheet, right? We're incredibly liquid, and we have a very up-market lending book, which is quite high-quality. So many, many things come together. I think what we've laid out on the page on capital in the material is that, our minimum requirement is 8%. We tend to run with a very healthy buffer above that. We've got a target range in the 10% to 11% and we've been way above that range probably because of a little bit of history over the last two years and we've bringing that down, but in a -- both at pace and also in a thoughtful way. I think what you'll see us do, and I say this is -- given what we know today, because we're going to be careful. If markets disrupt, then you slow a little bit. If you've got a lot of confidence in markets fees and there's confidence, then you might go in the other direction. But the middle of that range is a good place for us to aim towards, partly because you want to keep a little bit of extra, that's still 2.5 percentage points above the requirements. On the other hand, there are some uncertainties in the world and doesn't feel like we should run down to the lower end of that range right now, right? That feels like it wouldn't be -- it wouldn't be appropriate. So there's a range for a reason, I guess is what I'd say. We've been returning capital at pace in the last few quarters, billion dollars or more. We'd certainly like to continue to return capital at pace. You can kind of do the math of 11%, go down to the middle of the range. You got to remember there's pull to par that matters from the AFS portfolio that provides a tailwind and capital accretion, there's earnings. And then there's RWA management. You saw RWA pick up a little bit this quarter. Our goal is obviously to continue to optimize RWA and turn that into an advantage as well. So we see quite a healthy buyback going into the fourth quarter. We've got authorization, plenty of authorization to deliver on that. We know it's important to our shareholders and I think, a good path forward.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. Thanks for walking through that, Eric. And just a follow-up, quick question around NII, I guess, as you're thinking about [Alco] (ph) management. Is there -- as things reprice on the asset side within the securities book, are we kind of holding duration relative to where the back book is? Will at any point the thought process evolve to adding duration? I'm just wondering, how you're thinking about this cycle, the environment we might be for the next few years, and how that informs the duration you're willing to take on.\nEric Aboaf: Ebrahim, the answer is all the above. So every one of those factors matters. If we get more steepness to the yield curve, right, that would encourage us to add some duration. At the right time, we want to -- we may need a little more duration to protect against falling rates, right? That's even ideally be ahead of that. On the other hand, rates could move upwards further and so you want to be careful. I think we're careful in how we've configured the portfolio. You saw us do some of the repositioning. We unwound $4 billion or $5 billion of bonds. We reinvested towards the middle of the curve, but also at the front end, right? We have -- so it's not just an average duration position that we are focused on, but where are the points across the curve? And then there's a whole window of work that we do around the US curve, the Euro curve, and then the other foreign currencies. And then there's also a mix of duration -- clean duration we put on through treasuries and some of the convexity products like the agency MBS. So there's a wide range, but it's an active discussion, I'd say, at ALCO, and one that we think will both be -- we think of it both on an economic basis, but also on a risk management and protective basis, that we'll have, I think, quarter-to-quarter.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is already open.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you so much. Good afternoon. Eric, I want to ask a follow-up on the new revenue disclosure. In the past, you spoke about the level of gross asset flows that would be needed to offset natural attrition in the business. In a similar vein, I was hoping you could frame the level of gross revenue wins that are required to offset natural attrition, recognizing per, I think it was Brian's earlier question that, fee rates will certainly vary depending on new wins, but any way you could frame it in that context would be really helpful?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, here's what I described. You know, in the past we've talked about AUC/A wins. We had talked about $1.5 trillion of AUC/A wins a year. That's kind of a -- kind of volumetric benchmark. And as some of the discussion we've had, typically we've been winning on average higher than the current fee rate and so you can kind of work through that. On the fee revenue side and this is really around servicing fees, our goal for this year, 2023 is to deliver about $300 million of servicing fee wins. And you can compare that to the $5 trillion of -- sorry $5 billion of servicing fees for the year and that kind of gives you a sense for I'll call it gross revenue wins. As Ron described, we've got a series of initiatives, some of which are already playing through around adding to sales capacity, sales effectiveness, product feature functionality, and so forth. And part of the disclosure that we provided just last month was that, while $300 million of servicing fee wins is appropriate for this year, we'd like to get closer to $350 million to $400 million next year. And again, you can kind of compare that to the $5 billion of servicing fees, and that kind of gives you a sense of gross fee revenues. I think the follow on work you'd want to do is, just think about the other drivers of servicing fee revenue growth on a net basis, right? There is typically some amount of attrition. We said we'd like to have retention at 97%. So you can think about 3% servicing fee attrition, that's about $150 million a year, is a way to compare the gross wins versus the gross losses. And then there's some amount of fee headwinds, which is about 2% a year that we've described. So what we're trying to do is create clarity for all of you on the elements of that growth -- kind of the growth algebra. I'll say it in an analytic manner, so that you can see where we're really focused. And every one of those levers matter. We have tense efforts on each one of those, but it's that mix of activity and the sales, the servicing fee, sales in particular, that will help us then deliver core organic growth from year to year to year. And a good way for, I think, us internally to be clear about what we need to accomplish and externally with you all as to what the bar is for good organic growth and success.\nSteven Chubak: No, thanks for that color, Eric. And if I could just squeeze in one more clarifying question. There was a lot to unpack in the response to Ebrahim around Capital Management. It does appear, given the 4Q buyback level, assuming you execute on the $4.5 billion in its entirety, you'll be at the lower end of that 10% to 11% range of CET 1, recognizing there'll be a pull-to-par benefit. But should we be anchoring to the 80% to 100% payout that you guys have managed to in the past, just recognizing that there's not as much excess if you're going to run at those levels?\nEric Aboaf: I think for the rest of this year, the analytics I'd encourage you to do is to think about where we ended third quarter, kind of the middle of the range and that's not necessarily a point, but there's a range to the middle of the range. For fourth quarter, there's pull-to-par, there's RWA management. That gives us quite a healthy amount of buyback. And I think the continuation of something that's quite accretive to shareholders, that is substantial in terms of capital return. I think once we get to the middle of the range, then we're more likely to be that over 80% level of earnings. But I think that'll be probably how we think about next year. But that's next year. I think there is -- I think we have good visibility into a good and healthy amount of capital return and comfortably over what we've committed to, I'll call it the medium term.\nSteven Chubak: Really helpful, Eric. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Brown of KBW. Your line is already open.\nMichael Brown: Hey, great. Thank you for squeezing me in. So, multi-part question on the asset management business. So, first, it was just great to see the money fund flows come in this quarter and you mentioned that you believe there were some market share gains there. Can you just touch on what contributed to those gains and maybe some thoughts on the coming quarters? And then I look at the equity side, and consistent with the industry, there was pressure there on the flows. What's your thoughts on maybe when investor sentiment could improve and flex there? And then just last part here, when you take a step back and you look at SSGA today, is there anything strategically that could be interesting to you from an M&A perspective to help bolster the asset mix or accelerate some of the future growth potential in the business? Thank you.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Yeah, Mike, it's Ron. So lot there in your question. I think, on the cash business, I mean, this is a core competency that we've had for a long time, and it's also we've built up the capability both on the investment side and really on the distribution and channel side. So we've got a distribution and, if you will, kind of hooks in the water in many different pools and that's including by the way, lots of connectivity into the core custody business. So as you've seen, for example, rotation from deposits, we've captured some of that in the money market business, but the -- a lot of it -- most of it has been external, most of it has been around investment performance and kind of being where the money is flowing. The other areas that are also growing, DC is growing, and it's been growing for a while. Share has continued to grow there in the DC investment only, and that's been very much product and product innovation-driven. SSGA was one of the first to figure out how to put an annuity product into a target date fund. Did it actually before it got the broad regulatory go-ahead to do that, and that's actually now a source of real growth. So we see that as a growth area, as the defined benefit just goes away and people realize that longevity protection is something that people need. I think that combination of a target date fund with some kind of an insurance longevity product will be important and we've got real distinctive expertise in that. In terms of the growth areas, I mean there is -- we are really, for the most part, an institutional shop. We've built out the product capabilities in the retail and the intermediary space. Yie-Hsin Hung, who joined us as CEO late last year, she's got a lot of expertise there too. So some of it will be just moving and expanding share in the retail intermediary space. And then there's a real move into the -- into blending the line between public and private markets and the belief that those lines really don't make sense. And that blended products where you get sufficient liquidity would enable those that don't need the liquidity to take advantage of the illiquidity premium. So some of this will be in product design, whether that's organic or inorganic, I mean, we think there are opportunities in both. And there is -- the team has got lots of product development going on. So we're fully committed to that business. We see lots of growth in that business and are excited about the prospects there.\nMichael Brown: Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is already open.\nMichael Mayo: Hi. Well, it's been a long journey for you guys to get the Front to Back solutions and Alpha. And I'm just trying to figure out how much traction that has and where we're seeing that in the financial results. I hear your excitement, and you have alternatives now as part of that program, and you're guiding for positive 2024 fee operating leverage, and you have all these new mandates. On the other hand, I look at the fee growth this quarter and it wasn't that great, right? And so, are we seeing evidence of the Front to Back momentum in the results? Is it something that you expect to see, or is it simply such a long sales cycle that we should be thinking two, three, four years out? Thanks.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Mike, let me just start and maybe address the journey here, because this was not something that you bought off the shelf. It was actually something that nobody had ever done before. So there was an awful lot of development that we need to do, and I think we signaled that at the beginning. I mean, Charles River was an important acquisition. But to be clear, that was the front, and it itself needed some investment, particularly in the fixed-income area. So, much of what we've been doing over the last several years is selling and developing. Many of the early -- particularly some of the early large ones were explicit development partners. We targeted them, they targeted us and came in as development partners with the idea that they would help us to build this out. They've been purposely taken longer because they're the ones that are actually helping to shape what the overall thing will look like. This has been a very big year. Eric alluded to it in terms of some of the features and functionality, particularly around fixed income, and getting up to not just par, but to a market-leading position in terms of fixed income capability. So in terms of just getting the program up and running, we're actually quite pleased with where we are. I don't think we would have thought back in 2018, 2019 when we launched this, that we'd have the number of clients that we do now. The other thing that we were convinced of, but we had to prove it to ourselves, was that this could be a tool to actually generate new clients, that it wasn't just a way to solidify existing relationships, but it was a way to actually grow share and shift share. And that's what we're starting to see now. Vontobel was one, there's others in the pipeline. So it's a journey that we believe will see revenue growth at accelerating. And maybe I'll leave it there.\nEric Aboaf: And Mike, it's Eric. On the financials, it's a very fair question. I just remind you the context for the current year, because there are some other large movements on servicing fees. So if you think about it, we recorded a 1% growth in overall servicing fees, but there were tailwinds and headwinds away from the kind of organic new business creation -- that -- that's important that we need to demonstrate year after year. The market tailwind for year-on-year for this quarter was about 4 percentage points of servicing fees. So you'd say, hey, where is that? Part of that was about 3 percentage points of headwind came from lower client volumes and activity, right? A little bit of what we described as, we've seen less trading activity out there, which comes and goes, and tends to be cyclical. And then the other thing we did see this year and this quarter is that previously disclosed client exit was worth almost 2 percentage points as well. So there are -- I think, some larger headwinds and tailwinds in particular flowing through the financials, net new business, right? If we just want to take a look at that, was a positive 2 percentage points, year-on-year this quarter and that's where we'd like to see the value of Alpha, the value of traditional servicing fee sales, the value of private servicing fee sales. And part of the reason why we're adding to our disclosure is to make that more apparent to everyone over time.\nMichael Mayo: And then just one follow-up, Eric, and then Ron, just the exit of that large client, what inning are you in as far as that's concerned? And then Ron, as relates to accelerating revenue growth from the long journey of Alpha timing, are we thinking quarter here or several years?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, on the previously disclosed client, we're about 30% through that very roughly. The bulk of that will come through next year and then there's another -- there is just because of how year-on-year comparisons work, you'll get a tail into 2025.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: And Mike, just -- can you clarify your question? I just want to make sure [Multiple Speakers]\nMichael Mayo: Yeah, my initial question was fees aren't growing that much and Eric identified some headwinds to that. But you talked about the financial benefits from Alpha, the increased activity to result in accelerating revenue growth. I was just wondering a timeframe around that statement that revenue growth should accelerate due to the benefits of Alpha?\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Yeah, so, I mean, as we signalled I think at the beginning, I think probably -- I think it was out -- my answer to Alex. We're telling you that we believe we're going to achieve positive fee operating leverage. There's revenues there and there's expenses there. On the revenue side, we believe we've got a program in place that includes Alpha, that's going to enable us to do that. Some of that's driven by Alpha, some of that's driven by actions that we're taking, some of which have been implemented, others that will be implemented this quarter and into next in terms of strengthening sales and revenue-related capabilities. So what you should be hearing from us is confidence around our revenue growth generating capability.\nMichael Mayo: Okay. Thank you.\nRonald P. O’Hanley: Some of it is related to Alpha, and some of it is related to the core business. And what you should also -- and the point we normally don't go into a client example that we did there, but it's such a pure example of the strength -- the Vontobel example is such a pure illustration of the strength of Alpha because it's an institution we had no relationship with. We began the relationship with Front and Middle office, and then we brought along the Back office, which itself, as you know, Mike, as well as anybody, generates other kinds of ancillary revenues. So that's an illustration of how Alpha is enabling us. We believe, to pick up share that we wouldn't otherwise be able to pick up, and to do it in a way that's distinctive from our competitors.\nMichael Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is already open.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hi, Eric. Hi, Ron. Eric, can you share with us, I know -- I'm not asking to go into details on your budget for the upcoming year, but could you frame out for us though, the outside factors that influence the budgeting process on expenses such as wage inflation or other types of inflation? Do you feel that there's less pressure going into 2024 versus this time last year when you were doing your 2023 budget?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard. It's Eric. Yes, the headwinds have lessened. They're still there, but they've lessened. If you think about it, when we were doing the budget for 2023, it was the fall of 2022. We actually, at that point had done two formal merit increases that year, some of which were going to then play through on a carryover basis for 2023. So that was partly a headwind. And then we had a larger than probably typical merit increase by a little bit in the spring of this year in 2023. So that's -- we're not in that environment anymore. We certainly want to reward our employees with annual merit increases, but much more in line with what we've done over the last 5 or 10 years, as opposed to something that was much higher. So that's on the kind of wage side benefits. We're actually continuing to see some amount of inflationary activity, medical claims, dental, et cetera, as you'd expect. I think that's pretty broad-based. So, that's probably similar to prior years. And then I think the interesting area, where we're doing a lot of work on is all non-personnel spend, right. Our various partners and vendors and software licenses, cloud computing costs, every one of those is an area for us to think about what's appropriate. And so we have -- we've been having those discussions this summer and this fall, and we'll continue to have them into the winter around next year. Are we seeing inflationary increases the way we were a year ago there? A little bit less so, but I think we're still seeing higher than we'd like inflationary increases there. And so important questions are how do we offset them? How do we use technology if it is a little more expensive to drive, increasing process engineering and automation? How do we partner with fewer suppliers in some cases and get the benefits of our scale? So there's a number of initiatives that we're working through, but that's one that takes some work in a way, that's part of what we do during the budget process.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, obviously, our industry, the world has gone through incredible turmoil in the last three or four years with the pandemic and such. And now we're in this interest rate environment that we have not seen since prior to the financial crisis. And if we assume that the Fed is higher for longer, let's say it's 4% to 5% for an extended period of time versus the 0 to 25 bps that you all had to operate and the industry operated on post-financial crisis going into where we are today. How is that -- or is it changing some of the strategies you may pursue, now that the rate environment is not -- possibly not going back to the 50 basis points that we are accustomed to? Does that change the way you approach the business or approach your customers that you couldn't do because rates were at this level three or four years ago?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, it's Eric. I think it has several impacts on us, which actually in aggregate tend to be positive for how we manage and engage on our business. Very tactically, higher rates and especially some steepness in the yield curve we talked about earlier give us some ability to add duration and feel like that's valuable. So there's some tactical effects there. I think more broadly with higher rates, the value of cash in our ecosystem, we described trillion dollars of cash in our ecosystem across deposits, money market and cash sweeps in our asset management business, our repo activity, our platform sweep activities a trillion dollars. To us, cash is valuable for our clients to keep, especially in risk-on versus -- or especially in risk-off versus risk-on environments. And they want to be rewarded for it, but it also means there's a whole cash wallet out there that for us is a way to engage with clients, right? We as a bank who've got not only the banking offering of deposits but the capital markets offering of repo, the money management offering of money markets and cash management. To us, it's a way to deepen our relationships with clients. And I think over time, you'll see us add to our product offering, some of that's quite broad today, but we'll think about how else do we integrate cash into, say, the Alpha proposition is a way to consider it. How do we think about it in terms of our platforms and our market activities? A number of those are important cash generators. And then, I think, at the most senior levels with our clients, the C-suite actually cares about cash today. They care about who they keep it with, how it's managed, how they are renumerated, how it's safe, but also how it can be redeployed. And so it's become a real C-suite discussion in a way that we think can strengthen both our relationships, given our broad offering, but also one that becomes more and more of a business activity and a business growth activity over time.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will hand over the conference to Ron O'Hanley. Please proceed.\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Well, thank you, operator. And thanks to all on the call for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ronald P. O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier today we released our third quarter financial results. As we issued these results, the world has witnessed a surprise and unconscionable terrorist attack on innocent Israeli citizens and the resulting enormous human toll in Israel and Gaza. These terrible events have shocked the world and created further global geopolitical uncertainty. State Street stands with the people of Israel and we are united with all those impacted. Now turning to the third quarter, global financial market performance was mixed as a positive start for equity markets in July turned decisively negative as the quarter progressed. Against the backdrop of softening economic data, market sentiment was negatively impacted by continued global central bank rate hikes and investor concerns of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment in an economic hard landing. As a result, equities fell, while global bond yields continued climbing around the world, reaching levels not seen for many years with the US 10-year yield reaching its highest level since 2007. Despite these factors, the third quarter continued to be characterized by relatively low currency market volatility. Turning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation, I will review our third quarter highlights before Eric take -- takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, third quarter earnings per share was $1.25 or $1.93, excluding a loss on sale from an investment portfolio repositioning, which was a notable item in 3Q. EPS growth year-over-year, excluding notable items was driven by our significant common share repurchases during the period, coupled with a 3% increase in total fee revenue. This fee revenue growth reflects higher servicing and management fees, better front office software and data fees, and an increase in other fee revenue. Taken together, the benefit of share repurchases and the improvement in fee revenue more than offset lower NII, market headwinds within trading businesses, as well as the impact of year-over-year expense growth. That said, we are pleased with our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, which help us to contain that expense growth, while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses. Turning to our business momentum, within Investment Services, total AUC/A increased to $40 trillion at quarter end and we recorded $149 billion of new asset servicing wins during the third quarter, largely driven by wins in Official Institutions and Private Markets. The estimated annual new servicing fee revenue to be recognized in future periods associated with 3Q asset servicing wins amounted to $91 million, which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in over two years, demonstrating our ability to achieve our ambition of driving stronger sales performance. Encouragingly, Alpha's momentum continued in 3Q. We deepened relationships with existing mandates and recorded two new Alpha mandate wins, including our first Alpha for Private Markets mandate for one of the world's most influential investors. During the third quarter, we outlined a number of strategic focus areas for our Investment Services franchise, as we aim to drive opportunities across key regions and product areas and realize the full potential of our State Street Alpha value proposition. Importantly, we are taking actions aimed at gaining market share in reinvigorating revenue growth. We are executing against our plan to improve core back-office custody sales performance as it is our largest revenue pool installed quickly has significant scale and drives high-margin ancillary revenues. As an illustration of our custody sales momentum and the power of Alpha. In the third quarter, State Street in Vontobel, a premier global asset manager headquartered in Switzerland, entered into an agreement to expand our existing front and middle office relationship, by providing back-office services, subject to necessary approvals. State Street had no relationship with Vontobel until discussions began in 2020 around Alpha, resulting in the adoption of our front, middle and now back office services. Key client wins such as Vontobel, demonstrate how Alpha can establish, broaden, and deepen client relationships, further positioning State Street as our client's essential partner. It illustrates the value of the Alpha proposition and confirms our strategic rationale of how Alpha can grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's capabilities in a true one State Street solution for our clients, from front to back. Accelerating the sales cycle and implementation timeline, particularly back-office services remains an important strategic priority to drive even more fee revenue growth. Turning to our front office software and data businesses. CRD continues to perform well and has a strong pipeline. By the end of the third quarter, annual recurring revenue for our front office software and data business increased by 12% year-over-year to $299 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management reached $3.7 trillion at quarter end, supported by a record $41 billion of net cash inflows in 3Q. Importantly, our cash business gained market share in an expanding market, driven by strong investment performance coupled with a higher yield environment. In aggregate, Global Advisors gathered $10 billion of total net inflows in 3Q. Record quarterly flow performance in cash was partially offset by outflows in the institutional business, coupled with the impact of risk-off market sentiment in our ETF business in 3Q. While our ETF franchise saw modest net outflows in aggregate in 3Q, our US low-cost SPDR ETF franchise continues to be a bright spot, generating $7 billion of net inflows, gaining further market share. To drive continued growth, in 3Q we reduced the price on 10 low-cost SPDR portfolio ETFs, demonstrating our commitment to delivering institutional quality investment solutions at competitive price points. Lastly, on business momentum. I am proud to highlight that State Street's foreign exchange business has once again been recognized as the industry leader. After being ranked number one FX provider to asset managers by Euromoney Magazine in 2022, this year Euromoney Magazine's 2023 FX Awards named State Street as the winner across four categories, including Best FX Bank for Real Money Clients, Best FX Bank for Research, Best FX Venue for Real Money Clients, and Best FX Bank Sales. Turning to our financial condition, State Street's balance sheet, liquidity and capital positions remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 11% at quarter end, well above our regulatory minimum. This strength has enabled us to deliver against our goal of capital return to our shareholders. In 3Q, we returned $1.2 billion of capital, buying back $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means that cumulatively over the last four quarters to the end of September, we have returned approximately $5.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends. As we look ahead in the fourth quarter, it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases, under our existing authorization of up to $4.5 billion for 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, amidst the challenges of the market environment in 3Q, we remain dedicated to driving stronger business momentum and improving fee growth. To that end, in the third quarter, we outlined our sharpened execution plan to the Investment Services business, underpinned by a number of actions aimed at accelerating sales and revenue growth, while simultaneously improving the discipline in accountability for this execution. Our laser-focused on expense discipline also remains high. We have a well-established track record of reengineering our processes and transforming our operations to improve our efficiency and realize productivity growth. In the third quarter, we reduced expenses quarter-over-quarter, and announced another step in our multi-year productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model, while enabling even greater investment in our business. As part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we are streamlining our operations in India, we have now assumed full ownership of one of our joint ventures in the country. This consolidation will continue the transformation of State Street's global operations and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Yeah, Alex, it's Ron. I mean we're basing that comment largely on two things. One is, we feel like we've got quite good visibility around what we're doing from a cost perspective. So we feel like, we've got a series of initiatives underway that will continue into 2024 on managing our costs, while also continuing the investment program that we've got in place. That investment program includes some investments that will drive revenues in 2024 and beyond. But also the second thing it's based on is some of the actions we've taken around strengthening our sales and sales effectiveness and just pointing to the results we had in Q3, the note that Eric just made to you in terms of the visibility we have on 2024. So those two things, our confidence in expenses and what we believe is a nicely developing pipeline, and it's a set of sales capabilities and processes. I mean, obviously, markets could turn everything upside down, but based on a reasonable market forecast and not necessarily one that's going to be necessarily a tailwind, we do believe we can achieve positive fee operating leverage. Yes, Ken, it's Ron. I mean there's a number of initiatives underway, as we I think always talked about. We've really got an ongoing productivity that have actions underway, that is comprehensively looking throughout the organization. Some of the things that are underway now. We mentioned what's going on in India. And this India JV bringing that inside and this JV goes back to our early days in India, before we had our own Center of Excellence there. It's going to enable us to eliminate redundancy and eliminate a lot of oversight activities. So we'll be able to take down costs there, take down repetitive costs. We've got a comprehensive look at operating model throughout the business, which is, will start to yield results into next year. We're looking at some -- where work gets done throughout the world and are there places where we can move and combine things, create more end-to-end. So it's a series of things. Some of them -- you know a lot of the easy work has already been done. So some of these things have been -- the work's been underway for a while and we'll start to realize the benefits of it. But we see visibility such that we can make the statements that we are that notwithstanding that, we continue to make significant investments in the business that we feel we can keep our cost in reasonable check. Yes. Ken, what I would add to this, I think what we're talking about now is a continuation of what we started going back to 2019, that was rudely interrupted by COVID and everything that occurred coming out of COVID, the disruption, the great resignation, the issues that arose out of that with service quality and where we needed to overinvest to make up for some of the turnover that we were seeing that led to the kind of cost increase that you saw. That's all been normalized. Service quality has stabilized. And so, I would say that we're back on the path that we started back in 2019, and overcome what we saw in the kind of 2021-2022 period. Hey, Glenn, it's Ron. Obviously, you know the kind of growth that the private markets have seen, whether it's private equity and more recently private credit infrastructure and we see none of that abating. Private equity may be taking a bit of a pause, but all of the fundamentals point to those industries increasing, and in fact many of the large -- if you look at some of the large multi-asset managers, a lot of their growth is actually coming from privates. Much of that business today remains in sourced and there's very few standards in the business, a lot of it gets serviced in very expensive locations and is not a very good experience for the ultimate LP investors. So it's a very fast growth area for us. And it becomes more important for the sponsors, for the actual firms to actually get their arms around this, because the average ticket size is going down. 10, 15 years ago, the LP investors, typical LP investor was an institution, it was a pension fund, a sovereign wealth gun fund. Today, the average investor is some affluent person that's in some kind of a pooled fund. And so, getting this all right is actually quite important, and the demand is very high for us. We're investing a lot in it, a lot of technology in it. And increasingly, as these firms become multi asset, not just focused on -- in one area, the idea of an Alpha front to back kind of thing and all that's associated with it -- with data becomes very important, both as providers, but also as investors. So the opportunity here is not just the big private providers, but also the big private investors, the sovereign wealth funds and asset owners here. So yes, we see it as a very significant opportunity for us. It's a little bit hard to tell, Glenn. I think that we are certainly amongst the traditional asset servicers, we think that were early. You've got some of the very focused fund administrators that do some narrow kinds of activities in there, and certainly in terms of offering a full front to back solution that includes data, as far as we can tell, we're the only ones out there. So yes, we think in general we're early. Yeah, Mike, it's Ron. So lot there in your question. I think, on the cash business, I mean, this is a core competency that we've had for a long time, and it's also we've built up the capability both on the investment side and really on the distribution and channel side. So we've got a distribution and, if you will, kind of hooks in the water in many different pools and that's including by the way, lots of connectivity into the core custody business. So as you've seen, for example, rotation from deposits, we've captured some of that in the money market business, but the -- a lot of it -- most of it has been external, most of it has been around investment performance and kind of being where the money is flowing. The other areas that are also growing, DC is growing, and it's been growing for a while. Share has continued to grow there in the DC investment only, and that's been very much product and product innovation-driven. SSGA was one of the first to figure out how to put an annuity product into a target date fund. Did it actually before it got the broad regulatory go-ahead to do that, and that's actually now a source of real growth. So we see that as a growth area, as the defined benefit just goes away and people realize that longevity protection is something that people need. I think that combination of a target date fund with some kind of an insurance longevity product will be important and we've got real distinctive expertise in that. In terms of the growth areas, I mean there is -- we are really, for the most part, an institutional shop. We've built out the product capabilities in the retail and the intermediary space. Yie-Hsin Hung, who joined us as CEO late last year, she's got a lot of expertise there too. So some of it will be just moving and expanding share in the retail intermediary space. And then there's a real move into the -- into blending the line between public and private markets and the belief that those lines really don't make sense. And that blended products where you get sufficient liquidity would enable those that don't need the liquidity to take advantage of the illiquidity premium. So some of this will be in product design, whether that's organic or inorganic, I mean, we think there are opportunities in both. And there is -- the team has got lots of product development going on. So we're fully committed to that business. We see lots of growth in that business and are excited about the prospects there. Mike, let me just start and maybe address the journey here, because this was not something that you bought off the shelf. It was actually something that nobody had ever done before. So there was an awful lot of development that we need to do, and I think we signaled that at the beginning. I mean, Charles River was an important acquisition. But to be clear, that was the front, and it itself needed some investment, particularly in the fixed-income area. So, much of what we've been doing over the last several years is selling and developing. Many of the early -- particularly some of the early large ones were explicit development partners. We targeted them, they targeted us and came in as development partners with the idea that they would help us to build this out. They've been purposely taken longer because they're the ones that are actually helping to shape what the overall thing will look like. This has been a very big year. Eric alluded to it in terms of some of the features and functionality, particularly around fixed income, and getting up to not just par, but to a market-leading position in terms of fixed income capability. So in terms of just getting the program up and running, we're actually quite pleased with where we are. I don't think we would have thought back in 2018, 2019 when we launched this, that we'd have the number of clients that we do now. The other thing that we were convinced of, but we had to prove it to ourselves, was that this could be a tool to actually generate new clients, that it wasn't just a way to solidify existing relationships, but it was a way to actually grow share and shift share. And that's what we're starting to see now. Vontobel was one, there's others in the pipeline. So it's a journey that we believe will see revenue growth at accelerating. And maybe I'll leave it there. And Mike, just -- can you clarify your question? I just want to make sure [Multiple Speakers] Yeah, so, I mean, as we signalled I think at the beginning, I think probably -- I think it was out -- my answer to Alex. We're telling you that we believe we're going to achieve positive fee operating leverage. There's revenues there and there's expenses there. On the revenue side, we believe we've got a program in place that includes Alpha, that's going to enable us to do that. Some of that's driven by Alpha, some of that's driven by actions that we're taking, some of which have been implemented, others that will be implemented this quarter and into next in terms of strengthening sales and revenue-related capabilities. So what you should be hearing from us is confidence around our revenue growth generating capability. Some of it is related to Alpha, and some of it is related to the core business. And what you should also -- and the point we normally don't go into a client example that we did there, but it's such a pure example of the strength -- the Vontobel example is such a pure illustration of the strength of Alpha because it's an institution we had no relationship with. We began the relationship with Front and Middle office, and then we brought along the Back office, which itself, as you know, Mike, as well as anybody, generates other kinds of ancillary revenues. So that's an illustration of how Alpha is enabling us. We believe, to pick up share that we wouldn't otherwise be able to pick up, and to do it in a way that's distinctive from our competitors. Well, thank you, operator. And thanks to all on the call for joining us."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.25, which was down year-on-year due to the impact of the $294 million loss on sale in connection with the repositioning of our investment portfolio, which will benefit NII in the future periods. EPS was up year-on-year at $1.93, excluding the repositioning, which you can see on the right-hand side of the page. Turning to the core business, as you can see on the left panel of the slide, total fee revenue grew by 3% year-on-year, driven by growth in our front, middle and back office investment services business, as well as solid management fee performance at Global Advisors. This performance enabled us to offset some of the industry-wide headwinds we saw in our Global Markets business as well as lower NII, given the mixed macroeconomic backdrop in the quarter. Lastly, we remain focused on managing costs in the current operating environment, limiting expense growth to just 3% this quarter and achieving productivity savings as part of our plan to deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Turning now to Slide 5. We see -- we saw a period-end AUC/A increase by 12% on a year-on-year basis and 1% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period-end equity market levels and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased primarily due to client flows and net new business. While net new business was positive, long-term flows in the asset management industry has been muted, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. This risk-off sentiment leads to the current headwind across the servicing industry. At Global Advisors, period-end AUM increased 13% year-on-year and was down 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the increase was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels and inflows of $10 billion. Notably in the quarter, our cash franchise continued to perform strongly, generating a record $41 billion of net inflows, as our competitive performance contributed to market share gains. Quarter-on-quarter AUM increase mainly due to lower quarter-end market level. Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see third-quarter servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average equity markets, net new business and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed client transition. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 2% primarily as a result of lower client activity and adjustments in previously -- in a previously disclosed client transition, partially offset by higher average equity markets. As I've mentioned over the past year, we continue to see lower levels of client activity inflows, all of which impact transactional volumes, leading to a 2 percentage point to 3 percentage point headwind on servicing fees year-to-date. Part of this is the cyclical nature of the servicing business. The full-year effect has ranged from minus 2% -- minus 2% to plus 1 percentage point impact over the last five years. Within servicing fees, back office services were generally consistent in total servicing fee -- fees. Middle office services, which is part of the Alpha proposition had another quarter of good growth. On a year-over-year basis, middle office fees were up 3% and up 1% sequentially, largely driven by net new business. On the bottom panel of this page, we highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. We won $149 billion of new AUC/A. We onboarded roughly $250 billion of AUC/A in the quarter, primarily in the asset management client segment. And importantly, as Ron mentioned, we achieved new annual servicing fee revenue wins of $91 million this quarter, which will be recognized in future periods. These servicing wins underscore the progress we're making towards stronger sales performance. While we've historically only described wins in AUC/A terms, we recently expanded our disclosure to indicate that a healthy level of annual servicing sales is in $300 million range this year. You can measure us against this benchmark. We now have about $2.3 trillion of assets to be installed and about $255 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed as well. Turning to Slide 7, third-quarter management fees were $479 million, up 1% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels, partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 4% as a result of higher equity market levels and record quarterly cash net inflows. As you can see on the bottom-right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well-positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, we had neutral overall flows, but saw positive net inflows and consistent market share gains in the SPDR portfolio low-cost suite. As you know, we strategically dropped the fees on about a third of our low-cost suite of products and expect more growth in the coming quarters from this action. In our institutional business, notwithstanding net outflows of $30 billion in the quarter, which were primarily driven by client in-sourcing, both our Defined Contribution and Index Fixed Income products continue to drive strategic momentum. Lastly, across our client franchise, we saw record quarterly cash net inflows of $41 billion as we captured some of the cyclical movement of cash in the financial system. I'll just remind you that cash flows can be volatile quarter-to-quarter. Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter FX trading services revenue was down 2% year-on-year, while up 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower direct FX spreads and lower FX volatility, partially offset by higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the growth primarily reflects higher volumes. Industry volatility is down 25% to 40% across developed markets and emerging markets relative to the period a year ago, and down 5% to 10% sequentially, which is presenting fewer trading opportunities and lower spreads. Securities finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower specials activity and lower agency balances. Sequentially, revenues were down 12%, primarily as a result of seasonally lower activity and the recent industry drop-off of US Equity shoring activity and specials. Third quarter software and processing fees were up 2% year-on-year, but down 15% sequentially, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Other fee revenue increased $49 million year-on-year, primarily due to the tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market related adjustments. Moving to Slide 9, you'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 2% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services revenue, as we continue to convert and implant more clients to the SaaS environment, which now accounts for about 60% of our clients, partially offset by fewer on-premise renewals. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was down 20%, primarily driven by lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by higher software-enabled revenues. Our sales pipeline continues to grow and remain strong for our Charles River Development Front office solutions products. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics in the right panel, we are pleased, we had two more mandate wins in the quarter for Alpha. Most notably, we also had our first Alpha for Private Markets win. We also meaningfully advance CRD's institutional fixed income capabilities. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter NII decreased 5% year-on-year and 10% sequentially to $624 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to the continued mix-shift from non-interest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing, and lower average deposit balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by lower average deposit balances and the deposit mix-shift, partially offset by the benefit of higher interest rates, including international central bank hike and our investment portfolio repositioning. The NII results were somewhat better-than-expected due to non-interest-bearing deposit levels coming down slightly less-than-expected, and the portfolio repositioning, partially offset by client repricing, some of which will be delayed and will impact the fourth quarter instead. On the right of the slide, we showed our average balance sheet during the third quarter, with average deposits declining 4% quarter-on-quarter. Cumulative US dollar client deposit betas were 73% since the start of this recent cycle, while cumulative foreign currency deposit betas for the same period continued to be much lower in the 25% to 50% range. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, last month, we executed an NII accretive and capital accretive investment portfolio repositioning exercise to take advantage of both higher yields and spreads, which all else equal, should drive NII towards the higher end of the previously disclosed range of $550 million to $600 million per quarter next year. Turning to Slide 11. Third-quarter expenses excluding notable items increased 4% year-on-year. Sequentially, third-quarter expenses were down 1% as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in the strategic elements of the company including Alpha, Private Markets and Technology, and Operations Automation. On a line-by-line basis, year-on-year compensation and employee benefits increased 4% primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation, higher headcount, and the impact of currency translation. Sequentially, however, we brought headcounts down and we also reduced incentive compensation this quarter, in line with our year-to-date performance. Information systems and communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, insourcing, and vendor savings initiatives. Transaction processing increased 6%, mainly reflecting higher sub-custody vendor costs. Occupancy increased 4% as we relocated our headquarters building, and other expenses were up 4%, mainly reflecting higher marketing spend and professional fees. Moving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels, which remain above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimum. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11% was down 80 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained earnings. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 109% and 120% for the State Street Bank and Trust. In the quarter, we were quite pleased to return roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders, consistent -- consisting of just over $1 billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year ending September 30th, we repurchased approximately 12% of shares outstanding. Finally, a few brief closing thoughts before turning to outlook. Our third-quarter performance was solid with fee revenue growth of 3% year-on-year. We executed on our plan to improve sales capacity and reported $91 million in new servicing fee wins in the quarter, as we look towards our goal of $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee wins in 2024. And as you've seen us do for the last four years, we again demonstrate expense discipline, while continuing to invest in the business. Next, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding the fourth quarter. At a macro level, our interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards. We currently assume global equity markets will remain flat from now to quarter end, which implies the daily averages down about 3% quarter-on-quarter, bond markets are also expected to be down about 3% on average quarter-on-quarter. Regarding fee revenue in 4Q on a year-over-year basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be flat to up 1% year-over-year, with servicing fees approximately flat, and management fees to also be flattish. As we expect the year-on-year business drivers, similar to what we saw this quarter. We do expect fourth quarter sales momentum to be similar to the strong sales performance we saw in the third quarter. We also expect that our market businesses will be down modestly year-over-year, given lower volatility. We expect software and processing fees to be up 10% to 12%, largely due to the timing of on-prem renewals and the expected new SaaS installations, and we expect the other revenue line to come in at around $30 million to $40 million in the fourth quarter. Regarding NII, we now expect 3Q NII -- we now expect 4Q NII to be towards the middle of the $550 million to $600 million range we previously mentioned. This includes continued expected rotation of about $3 billion to $4 billion out of non-interest-bearing deposits and the impact of deposit pricing, which we previously noted, but with more stability in the total deposit averages. Turning to expenses, we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment and expect to maintain relatively flat expenses in 4Q quarter-over-quarter. As always, this is on an ex-notables basis, and in this regard, we are keeping an eye on the likely FDIC assessment. And we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 4Q will be around 22%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Alex, it's Eric. Let me answer that from a couple of different directions to give you some texture, because as we think about go-forward fee revenues, right? Part of what matters is installing the backlog. Part of what matters is new sales, right? Sort of maintaining the third quarter momentum to the fourth quarter and into next year, because some of those sales actually come through in the subsequent few quarters. And then, as we talked about back in September, making sure that we're very effective on our retention activities. So every one of those matters. In terms of the backlog, we said there's about $255 million of revenues in the backlog on the -- on servicing fees and north of $2 trillion on an AUC/A basis. The implementation is a little bit different in each of the regards. In terms of revenues, we think about 5%, 10% of that will come through, specifically in the fourth quarter, so that's included in our guide. We expect 50% to 60% of that $255 million to come through next year, and then the balance in 2025. So it's kind of a good mix and aligned with what we'd like. The AUC/A implementation is a little more -- is little quicker. Just sometimes that happens, it's quicker, sometimes slower, that's a little closer to 30% in fourth quarter and around 60% next year, but those will move around as they play out. But we've got good visibility now. And what we've been particularly pleased with on our third quarter sales in particular was that, a lot of that was around back office services. And back office services as you know, are one of the fastest to onboard and implement, and that's going to provide some momentum into the first half of 2024. Yeah, Ken, it's Eric. As you surmised, there are a number of factors that matters, especially at this point in the cycle. As we transition from declining NII to some level of stabilization, and we see a good rationale for some uptick from fourth quarter into the first quarter of next year. So let me just go through them, right? There is a continued amount of rotation of NIB, non-interest-bearing deposits. We still expect some in the fourth quarter, but we expect that that starts to flatten out at the beginning of next year. We'll see exactly how much and when. It's hard to call and it moves around. We've got quite a bit of visibility into our repricing, especially for our largest and most sophisticated clients, I described that last year. And then we're through a good bit of that. We have -- we execute on some more of it in the third quarter, we expect and we have very good visibility into fourth quarter. And so, the kind of the repricing effects and the catch-up is kind of a bubble that works its way through. On the tailwind side, we then have the investment portfolio rolling through. And the investment portfolio matures $4 billion, $5 billion bonds quarter, you've got the new bonds come on roughly at 200 basis points, sometimes 300 basis points higher than the ones that are maturing. And so, that's what's giving us a positive trajectory. And so it's really those three factors, plus a little bit of lending growth and some of our other actions that we can control that we think starts to shape, a stabilization of NII as we get from fourth quarter to the first quarter, but, it'll depend. There'll be some movements and as you know we update all of you as frequently as we are in public and we'll continue to do that, but those are the trajectories and our expectations at this point. And Ken, I'll just add that the other thing that we have -- we're down on effectively that we talked about over the last quarter or so was our hiring freeze. I mean, what we found is, we've got outstanding individuals and people on our team. And part of what we need to do is, we reinvest in different features of the business or different areas. We actually need to reallocate some of that talent to those areas and actually, at the same time, we need to find efficiencies in others. And so that's been -- well it is -- it is hard work, it's been an effective way to actively manage our team and our human resources. It still means we invest in all that we need to do for new products, functionality, regulatory requirements and so forth. But the reallocation that's born from the -- from this sort of freeze is actually very effective tool for us at this stage in the cycle. Brennan, it's Eric. Yes, broadly, but with the asterisks of the seasonality that we've seen, it has moved around a bit, sometimes a little stronger, sometimes it's a little weaker than typical. So we do see a bit of an uptick in a normalization in total deposits. And so we'll -- we've guided to stabilization, maybe we'll see an uptick, we'll see. But -- this is based on really quite deep analysis of our client deposit base. Remember, we managed it on the US dollar, we managed on each of the foreign currencies. We have just an NIB, for example, I think we have 30,000 accounts, the average account size is $1 million. We've seen the trends in the largest, most sophisticated client and largest accounts come down quite a bit. The smaller ones tend to have a flatter line and evolution. So the guide is based on that plus a little bit of the seasonality, and we'll just update as we go. But I think we've started to see some amount of inflection here. But we want to be careful, right? There's still some amount of rotation playing out. There's some amount of balances and pricing coming through. A good bit of which we have a visibility into, but it'll take a little time to just work through it in the next few months and quarters. Brennan, it's early to do that. You know, we -- I think what gives us confidence and actually the feel of necessity on fee operating leverage is, we need to run the business in a way that is healthy for our shareholders and our various stakeholders at the same time and we need to find a way through that. We certainly have gone through a strategic planning exercise. We do that through the summer, July, August, and September, and we have -- we've got our path forward. We believe both on the top-line and on expenses, it's a little soon to get into that. But we're working through that and part of what we're doing now is actually making sure that we have detailed plans, business-by-business, function-by-function. We run alternative scenarios. We even develop contingency plans and we are also -- we are careful about metering out our spend next year, where we do add to spend, we're going to do that with stage gate. So there's a lot going on right now and we'll come back with kind of a full set of guide -- guidelines and guidance in January. But I think -- we're confident that we've got a path forward here that'll be healthy and fee operating leverage is very good way for us to think about it and I think for you guys as well. And Glenn, just add a little bit of the kind of quantitative elements of this. Private markets, broadly defined around the world from a servicing fee standpoint are growing in the 9% to 10% a year. We described our performance, which has been quite strong in that area. And based on our client base and our pipeline, our expectation is that, we should be growing in the 15% range next year. Part of that is because we serve so many large global asset managers who have a wide range, both in traditional products and in privates, right? So they're coming to us, and partly because increasingly we're serving the classic alternative and private organizations, right, who increasingly want to focus on what their core investment process is as opposed to processing. And so, we see more and more outsourcing and opportunities for us from that segment as well. Ryan, it's Eric. The overall cadence of fee repricings have been stable for us and I think for the industry the last couple years. As you know, back in 2019, we went through a phase of higher repricings, but they've been relatively consistent in that kind of 2% or so headwind level, which is not that different from what it was over the last five years to 10 years. So that's been relatively stable. What we have seen is very good fee rates on new business. And part of that is the discussion we just had in privates, where just because of the nature of the activity, the servicing, it tends to be a manually intensive process. The fee rates are multiples of the average fee rate for our business. And in fact, the last couple of quarters, we've seen fee rates on new business comfortably above the average that we've seen. You can just do a little bit of comparison and we'd be cautious about doing it for every quarter. But take the last few quarters of AUC/A wins, the last few quarters of fees wins and you kind of -- you get to that view. And we've mentioned that in ways in our quarterly reports this year in particular. So I think in some ways, what we've been able to find is that, with Alpha, we bring more to a client across the AUC/A base, right? So we have fees on the front office side, which we disclose separately, but both the middle and the back office, we have complex clients, and so that's been quite fruitful for us. And then the alternatives and privates is a very -- is a much higher fee rate area, just by virtue of that industry. And that together is what gives us some of the revenue kind of momentum that we've seen into the third quarter of this year and we expect in the fourth quarter as well. No, if you just look at the aggregates, remember you've got this kind of effect, where when equity markets are up, right, you kind of have this natural thinning in the fee rate just because of how the fee schedules are structured, right? And they're not -- they're not quite like they are in the asset management business. So no, that's been fairly -- that was expected and in line with the ranges that we've been seeing. Brian, it's Eric. I'm really glad you asked that question because with new disclosure comes sometimes very simple answers and sometimes more textured ones. So what you've done is an analysis. If you look at our fee wins divided by our new AUC/A wins, which on average, over time, I'll stress that will approximate the rates that of the win. The challenge is, in any one quarter, remember, some of what we win is on existing AUC/A business. So Ron mentioned one of the global asset managers, we added back office to that relationship. Those AUC/As were already in our base. Why? Because we had already been doing both front and middle office processing for them. So in a way, those fees wins in the quarter cannot be compared to any of the new AUC/A. That's kind of apples and oranges. On the other hand, sometimes the opposite happens, right? Where we might be adding an AUC/A and a fee that's quite high, one that's quite low, because we're just adding a small service and we've had some of those over the last couple of quarters. So I'll just be -- I'll just be cautious about the quarter-by-quarter map. I'd encourage you over time, we can look at that through time. But, I think what we encourage you to do is take a look at the revenue -- the wins on a revenue basis against the base of servicing fees, right, $91 million in the quarter against the $5 billion of servicing fees is a very healthy amount of revenue. And our ability to maintain that momentum gives you an indication of the kind of sales effectiveness and the growth dynamic that we can create net of the retention rates that we need to manage, too. So I'd encourage you to spend the most time there. You can do a little bit AUC/A wins versus the AUC/A base that gives you another indication. But I'd encourage you to do it in that direction, because you'll get a better indication, I think of our momentum. You know, our current indication in, we're well through the cycle in the US, at least we think so, we'll see. It feels like there's little more to go on the international side and it started later, so it's harder to read. We do see that there are some structural differences in the markets around deposit betas between the US currency and the non-dollar, even for the same clients in some cases. And part of that is just the -- you've got this non-interest-bearing versus interest-bearing construct in the US and internationally you can have just an interest-bearing deposit construct. So, it's a little more -- it's a little more straightforward. So as I've described, we have cumulative deposit betas in the US in the 70% to 75% range and we expect that will flowed up a little more as we kind of -- as the cycle, let's say, finishes, it could go up another 5, 10 percentage points but it's starting to level off. In Europe, the – we are in the 25% to 50% range of cumulative beta, I think could go up another 10 points, maybe 15 points, we'll see, but it's not going to reach the same level that you have in the US based on the indications we have, and the way we both reprice and we see others competitively price in the market. So, fairly, fairly different between the US and the international currencies. And in some way, that plays to -- that's good for us. We know how to manage in both US and non-US currencies. We've continue to have some tailwinds in NII in the international currencies. We obviously need to make sure that we share some of that with clients, but given the international composition of our balance sheet, that's one of the areas that continues to be supportive of our -- in a positive way of our NII trajectory. Let me start on that, Ebrahim. We -- it's Eric. Capital is one of the most important elements of the balance sheet and we spend a lot of time thinking about what are the levels of capital? How to manage? It is based on facts and circumstances, right? The economic environment, the uncertainty, our confidence in earnings and earnings momentum, what we can see in the strength of our balance sheet, right? We're incredibly liquid, and we have a very up-market lending book, which is quite high-quality. So many, many things come together. I think what we've laid out on the page on capital in the material is that, our minimum requirement is 8%. We tend to run with a very healthy buffer above that. We've got a target range in the 10% to 11% and we've been way above that range probably because of a little bit of history over the last two years and we've bringing that down, but in a -- both at pace and also in a thoughtful way. I think what you'll see us do, and I say this is -- given what we know today, because we're going to be careful. If markets disrupt, then you slow a little bit. If you've got a lot of confidence in markets fees and there's confidence, then you might go in the other direction. But the middle of that range is a good place for us to aim towards, partly because you want to keep a little bit of extra, that's still 2.5 percentage points above the requirements. On the other hand, there are some uncertainties in the world and doesn't feel like we should run down to the lower end of that range right now, right? That feels like it wouldn't be -- it wouldn't be appropriate. So there's a range for a reason, I guess is what I'd say. We've been returning capital at pace in the last few quarters, billion dollars or more. We'd certainly like to continue to return capital at pace. You can kind of do the math of 11%, go down to the middle of the range. You got to remember there's pull to par that matters from the AFS portfolio that provides a tailwind and capital accretion, there's earnings. And then there's RWA management. You saw RWA pick up a little bit this quarter. Our goal is obviously to continue to optimize RWA and turn that into an advantage as well. So we see quite a healthy buyback going into the fourth quarter. We've got authorization, plenty of authorization to deliver on that. We know it's important to our shareholders and I think, a good path forward. Ebrahim, the answer is all the above. So every one of those factors matters. If we get more steepness to the yield curve, right, that would encourage us to add some duration. At the right time, we want to -- we may need a little more duration to protect against falling rates, right? That's even ideally be ahead of that. On the other hand, rates could move upwards further and so you want to be careful. I think we're careful in how we've configured the portfolio. You saw us do some of the repositioning. We unwound $4 billion or $5 billion of bonds. We reinvested towards the middle of the curve, but also at the front end, right? We have -- so it's not just an average duration position that we are focused on, but where are the points across the curve? And then there's a whole window of work that we do around the US curve, the Euro curve, and then the other foreign currencies. And then there's also a mix of duration -- clean duration we put on through treasuries and some of the convexity products like the agency MBS. So there's a wide range, but it's an active discussion, I'd say, at ALCO, and one that we think will both be -- we think of it both on an economic basis, but also on a risk management and protective basis, that we'll have, I think, quarter-to-quarter. Yeah, here's what I described. You know, in the past we've talked about AUC/A wins. We had talked about $1.5 trillion of AUC/A wins a year. That's kind of a -- kind of volumetric benchmark. And as some of the discussion we've had, typically we've been winning on average higher than the current fee rate and so you can kind of work through that. On the fee revenue side and this is really around servicing fees, our goal for this year, 2023 is to deliver about $300 million of servicing fee wins. And you can compare that to the $5 trillion of -- sorry $5 billion of servicing fees for the year and that kind of gives you a sense for I'll call it gross revenue wins. As Ron described, we've got a series of initiatives, some of which are already playing through around adding to sales capacity, sales effectiveness, product feature functionality, and so forth. And part of the disclosure that we provided just last month was that, while $300 million of servicing fee wins is appropriate for this year, we'd like to get closer to $350 million to $400 million next year. And again, you can kind of compare that to the $5 billion of servicing fees, and that kind of gives you a sense of gross fee revenues. I think the follow on work you'd want to do is, just think about the other drivers of servicing fee revenue growth on a net basis, right? There is typically some amount of attrition. We said we'd like to have retention at 97%. So you can think about 3% servicing fee attrition, that's about $150 million a year, is a way to compare the gross wins versus the gross losses. And then there's some amount of fee headwinds, which is about 2% a year that we've described. So what we're trying to do is create clarity for all of you on the elements of that growth -- kind of the growth algebra. I'll say it in an analytic manner, so that you can see where we're really focused. And every one of those levers matter. We have tense efforts on each one of those, but it's that mix of activity and the sales, the servicing fee, sales in particular, that will help us then deliver core organic growth from year to year to year. And a good way for, I think, us internally to be clear about what we need to accomplish and externally with you all as to what the bar is for good organic growth and success. I think for the rest of this year, the analytics I'd encourage you to do is to think about where we ended third quarter, kind of the middle of the range and that's not necessarily a point, but there's a range to the middle of the range. For fourth quarter, there's pull-to-par, there's RWA management. That gives us quite a healthy amount of buyback. And I think the continuation of something that's quite accretive to shareholders, that is substantial in terms of capital return. I think once we get to the middle of the range, then we're more likely to be that over 80% level of earnings. But I think that'll be probably how we think about next year. But that's next year. I think there is -- I think we have good visibility into a good and healthy amount of capital return and comfortably over what we've committed to, I'll call it the medium term. And Mike, it's Eric. On the financials, it's a very fair question. I just remind you the context for the current year, because there are some other large movements on servicing fees. So if you think about it, we recorded a 1% growth in overall servicing fees, but there were tailwinds and headwinds away from the kind of organic new business creation -- that -- that's important that we need to demonstrate year after year. The market tailwind for year-on-year for this quarter was about 4 percentage points of servicing fees. So you'd say, hey, where is that? Part of that was about 3 percentage points of headwind came from lower client volumes and activity, right? A little bit of what we described as, we've seen less trading activity out there, which comes and goes, and tends to be cyclical. And then the other thing we did see this year and this quarter is that previously disclosed client exit was worth almost 2 percentage points as well. So there are -- I think, some larger headwinds and tailwinds in particular flowing through the financials, net new business, right? If we just want to take a look at that, was a positive 2 percentage points, year-on-year this quarter and that's where we'd like to see the value of Alpha, the value of traditional servicing fee sales, the value of private servicing fee sales. And part of the reason why we're adding to our disclosure is to make that more apparent to everyone over time. Yeah, on the previously disclosed client, we're about 30% through that very roughly. The bulk of that will come through next year and then there's another -- there is just because of how year-on-year comparisons work, you'll get a tail into 2025. Gerard. It's Eric. Yes, the headwinds have lessened. They're still there, but they've lessened. If you think about it, when we were doing the budget for 2023, it was the fall of 2022. We actually, at that point had done two formal merit increases that year, some of which were going to then play through on a carryover basis for 2023. So that was partly a headwind. And then we had a larger than probably typical merit increase by a little bit in the spring of this year in 2023. So that's -- we're not in that environment anymore. We certainly want to reward our employees with annual merit increases, but much more in line with what we've done over the last 5 or 10 years, as opposed to something that was much higher. So that's on the kind of wage side benefits. We're actually continuing to see some amount of inflationary activity, medical claims, dental, et cetera, as you'd expect. I think that's pretty broad-based. So, that's probably similar to prior years. And then I think the interesting area, where we're doing a lot of work on is all non-personnel spend, right. Our various partners and vendors and software licenses, cloud computing costs, every one of those is an area for us to think about what's appropriate. And so we have -- we've been having those discussions this summer and this fall, and we'll continue to have them into the winter around next year. Are we seeing inflationary increases the way we were a year ago there? A little bit less so, but I think we're still seeing higher than we'd like inflationary increases there. And so important questions are how do we offset them? How do we use technology if it is a little more expensive to drive, increasing process engineering and automation? How do we partner with fewer suppliers in some cases and get the benefits of our scale? So there's a number of initiatives that we're working through, but that's one that takes some work in a way, that's part of what we do during the budget process. Gerard, it's Eric. I think it has several impacts on us, which actually in aggregate tend to be positive for how we manage and engage on our business. Very tactically, higher rates and especially some steepness in the yield curve we talked about earlier give us some ability to add duration and feel like that's valuable. So there's some tactical effects there. I think more broadly with higher rates, the value of cash in our ecosystem, we described trillion dollars of cash in our ecosystem across deposits, money market and cash sweeps in our asset management business, our repo activity, our platform sweep activities a trillion dollars. To us, cash is valuable for our clients to keep, especially in risk-on versus -- or especially in risk-off versus risk-on environments. And they want to be rewarded for it, but it also means there's a whole cash wallet out there that for us is a way to engage with clients, right? We as a bank who've got not only the banking offering of deposits but the capital markets offering of repo, the money management offering of money markets and cash management. To us, it's a way to deepen our relationships with clients. And I think over time, you'll see us add to our product offering, some of that's quite broad today, but we'll think about how else do we integrate cash into, say, the Alpha proposition is a way to consider it. How do we think about it in terms of our platforms and our market activities? A number of those are important cash generators. And then, I think, at the most senior levels with our clients, the C-suite actually cares about cash today. They care about who they keep it with, how it's managed, how they are renumerated, how it's safe, but also how it can be redeployed. And so it's become a real C-suite discussion in a way that we think can strengthen both our relationships, given our broad offering, but also one that becomes more and more of a business activity and a business growth activity over time."

O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our second quarter financial results. Relative to the significant volatility experienced by investors in the first quarter, market conditions in 2Q were more subdued and global financial market performance is varied. Global equities generated positive returns for the third consecutive quarter as investors saw continued strength in developed equity markets, but weakness in emerging markets. Fixed income market sell as investors had to contend was still elevated levels of inflation and further central bank rate hikes, including the Federal Reserve raising interest rates above 5% for the first time since 2007. The second quarter was also characterized by falling currency market volatility, which created headwinds for our foreign exchange business. Turning to slide three of our investor presentation, I will review our second quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, second quarter ROE was 13% and pre-tax margin expanded by 1.2 percentage points year-over-year to 29.5%. Relative to the year-ago period, 2Q EPS increased by 14% to $2.17 supported by our common share repurchases, significantly higher NII, strong front office software and data revenue growth and an increase in securities finance revenue. Our results also benefited from the release of an allowance related to the support of a financial -- US financial institution as well as an accounting adoption. Taken together, these factors more than offset headwinds in some of our other fee-based businesses and the impact of higher-than-desired year-over-year expense growth. Turning to our business momentum, in Q1, I highlighted that by strengthening our implementation capabilities, we have a line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding this year. We began to realize the benefits of this plan and onboarded $1.2 trillion of AUC/A during the second quarter, primarily driven by State Street Alpha, underscoring the power of the Alpha value proposition to our investment services strategy and long-term growth. As a result, our AUC/A installation backlog declined to $2.4 trillion, while total AUC/A increased by 5% quarter-over-quarter to $39.6 trillion, both at quarter-end in part as a result of this new business. We also recorded over $140 billion of asset servicing wins in the second quarter, largely driven by strong sales in the desirable asset owner, official institutions and alternatives client segments. Our sales pipeline grew and we expect substantial on-boardings in the coming quarters. We continue to advance and broaden our enterprise outsource solutions strategy across our clients' front, middle and back-office activities, as demonstrated by the expansion of Alpha's capabilities to ETFs, which we announced in 2Q. For the past 30 years, State Street has continuously innovated to support what has become a $10 trillion ETF market. Today, State Street is the largest ETF administrator in the world with more than 2,700 ETF serviced in 13 countries. That long cycle of innovation continues as State Street Alpha now supports the entire ETF lifecycle. By integrating CRD's front office products with State Street's industry-leading ETF servicing capabilities, Alpha now provides a centralized platform for ETFs issuers across the entire ETF lifecycle, including portfolio management, trading and compliance to enable the growth across a variety of ETF strategies and increased speed-to-market. Turning to front office software and data business, our overall CRD pipeline is strong. In the second quarter, we converted a meaningful number of on-prem CRD clients to recurring SaaS revenue, which when coupled with new SaaS client implementations, increased annual recurring revenue by 12% relative to the year-ago period. In addition, Charles River Wealth Management Solution continues to resonate with clients and drove a significant increase in on-prem revenues this quarter. Year-to-date, CRD's wealth-driven revenue has more than doubled as compared to the first half of 2022 and we remain on track to grow CRD's wealth revenue this year. The State Street Global Advisors quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.8 trillion, supported by higher period-end market levels and $38 billion of net inflows from all three business lines, ETF, cash and institutional. Our SPDR ETF business gathered $27 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, including $20 billion of net inflows into SPY, the industry's largest ETF. We also delivered a solid performance in our US low-cost ETF segment, which gathered $7 billion of net inflows in the quarter, continuing to gain market share. Our cash business gathered a solid $10 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, as our US government money market funds benefited from the attractiveness of the cash asset class in the higher-rate environment. Turning to our financial condition, State Street's balance sheet, liquidity and capital positions remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 11.8% at quarter-end, well above our regulatory minimum. The ongoing capital generation of our business, coupled with effective balance sheet management and our strong capital position has enabled us to deliver against our goal of returning significant capital to our shareholders. In 2Q, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of capital, buying back more than $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means that cumulatively over the last three quarters to the end of June, we have returned approximately $4.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends. The strength of our balance sheet was also highlighted with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test results in June, following which, we announced our intention for the third year in a row to increase State Street's common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter, subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors. It remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our existing authorization for up to $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, financial market conditions in the second quarter were mixed. Although global equities recorded another sequential quarter of growth, there was weakness in emerging markets and we witnessed the negative impact of persistent inflation and further central bank rate hikes on fixed-income markets. Meanwhile, both equity and currency volatility continued to decline. Despite this varied backdrop, we achieved a number of positive outcomes in the second quarter, including meaningfully reducing our asset servicing backlog, further developing our Alpha capabilities, continuing to record new asset servicing wins, driving strong growth in front office software and data revenue and gathering solid net inflows at Global Advisors. And while we reached double-digit year-over-year EPS growth supported by our capital management and the higher interest-rate environment, our results were below our potential. First, while we achieved sequential fee revenue growth in areas of our business this quarter, we need to demonstrate the fee growth every quarter especially as NII. We need to demonstrate that fee growth every quarter especially as NII is no longer a tailwind. And second, we are highly focused on controlling our expense base. We have a well-established track record of reengineering our processes and transforming our operations in order to improve our efficiency and realized productivity growth. We plan to utilize additional tactical expense levers at our disposal in addition to our ongoing structural productivity efforts in order to support our financial performance for the benefit of our shareholders. Now let me hand the call over to Eric who'll take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on slide four. We reported EPS of $2.17 for the quarter, an increase of 14% relative to the second quarter a year ago. As you can see on the left panel of this slide, revenue grew by 5% year-on-year, driven by the expansion in our front-office solutions area, where we are an industry leader, continued momentum in securities finance business as well as strong growth in net interest income. This growth enabled us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in other fee areas given the relatively mixed macroeconomic backdrop. We also had the benefit of an accounting change for tax credit investments, which simplifies our reporting going forward. While our overall year-on-year fee growth was less than we would have liked to deliver, we did see sequential quarter revenue momentum and a step up in the sales pipeline, which we expect to build upon in the coming quarters and which I'll discuss later in today's presentation. As we drive growth, we continue to prudently invest in the business while remaining focused on managing costs given the current operating environment, and we stand ready to further intervene on expenses should the softness in the global environment persists. Turning now to slide five. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 4% on a year-on-year basis and 5% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period-end equity market levels and client net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of the significant trillion-dollar Alpha installation and higher period-end market levels. At Global Advisors, we saw similar positive dynamics play out in the quarter. Period-end AUM increased 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially. The year-on-year increase in AUM was largely driven by higher period-end market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was also due to higher period-end market levels as well as strong sequential net inflows. Turning to slide six. On the left side of the page, you'll see second quarter total servicing fees down 3% year-on-year as net-new business in the quarter was more than offset by lower client activities and adjustments largely due to lower custody and transaction volume and better than usual pricing headwinds. Positive year-on-year equity markets were offset by the negative impact of fixed-income markets. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 3% primarily as a result of higher average market levels and net-new business slightly offset by better-than-usual pricing headwinds this quarter. We had a more constructive market environment relative to the first quarter as well as a significant onboarding of $1.2 trillion of AUC/A related to an Alpha client in the asset manager client segment, which comes at a modest fee rate, but with services are expected to be added in the coming years. Within servicing fees, back-office servicing fees were generally consistent with total servicing fees and largely driven by the factors I just described. Middle office services fees performance was meaningfully more positive for the quarter. On a year-on-year basis, fees were up 3% primarily reflecting net-new business and up 10% sequentially, largely driven by the installation that I just mentioned. On the bottom panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators which highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. While total AUC/A wins in the second quarter were not as robust in volume terms, client engagement remained healthy and we saw wins across strategic segments, including mandates and asset owners, official institutions and alternatives, which are key growth areas for us as we previously mentioned. The wins including those in the alternatives segment, which are more complex to service come with above-average fee rates. We have also seen a healthy uptick in our pipeline this quarter. Turning to slide seven. Second quarter management fees were $461 million, down 6% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the impact of net outflows from prior periods, a shift of certain management fees into NII as previously described and some pricing headwinds, partially offset by higher average market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 1% as a result of higher market levels and cash net inflows. As you can see on the bottom-right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well-positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of our three lines of business. In ETFs, we saw very strong net inflows of $27 billion into SPY and our sector suite of ETFs as well as our SPDR portfolio low-cost suite. In our institutional business, we saw net inflows with continued momentum in our well-established index fixed-income and defined contribution franchises. Across our cash franchise, we continue to see strong demand for our money market funds. We recorded net inflows of $10 billion. Turning to slide eight. Relative to the period a year ago, second quarter FX trading services revenue was down 8% year-on-year and 11% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes and lower industry FX volatility. Relative to the period a year-ago, both volumes and volatility were more muted as the start of the war in Europe last year caused unusually high FX trading activity in the first half of 2022. Many clients were also risk-off during the debt ceiling discussions in April and May, with a rebound in June and client volumes falling its resolution. Altogether 2Q is muted. We are optimistic about 3Q, but it's hard to predict. Securities finance performed well in the second quarter with revenues up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher agency spreads. Sequentially, revenues were up 7%, again mainly driven by higher agency spreads as well as higher prime services or enhanced custody revenues from deeper client engagement and specials activity, partially offset by lower balances. Moving on to software and processing fees. Second quarter software and processing fees were up 18% year-on-year and 34% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD which I will turn to shortly. Lending fees for the quarter were down 5% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix, but up 5% sequentially, mainly driven by strong client demand for lines of credit. Finally, other fee revenue increased $101 million year-on-year, primarily due to a tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market-related adjustments. This includes the impact of the new accounting adoption. Moving to slide nine, you'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 29% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher on-premise renewals and continued growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services revenue as we continue to convert and implant more clients over to our SaaS environment. About 60% of our clients are now on our SaaS platform. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was up nearly 50%. About two-thirds of this uptick was driven by wealth management mandates that are becoming an increasingly important growth segment for us. Our sales pipeline continues to grow and remains strong for our Charles River development front office solutions products. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we were pleased, we had three more Alpha mandates go live, which brings our total live Alpha clients to 15, and as I previously mentioned, we installed a significant portion of assets related to Alpha this quarter. We expect to provide more services related to these assets in the future, helping us increase the share of our client's wallet. Now turning to slide 10. Second quarter NII increased 18% year-on-year, but declined 10% sequentially to $691 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-term rates and increase in long-term rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower average deposits. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by our continued rotation of non-interest-bearing deposit balances and rate pressure in the US back-book, partially offset by higher short-term market rates from international central bank hikes. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Average deposits declined 2% quarter-on-quarter in line with industry total deposit trends, which also fell by 2% in the second quarter and reflect client preferences to shift some cash to other products during periods of rising rates. Our operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remained consistent at approximately 75%. Our global floating-rate loan book provides upside at this stage in the cycle and our investment portfolio positioning provides a tailwind as long rates roll through. We now also have the opportunity to selectively add some duration across the curve, as we see good entry points, which could enhance NII over time. Sequentially, US dollar client deposit betas were 100% during the second quarter, leading again to some sequential NII compression. We are now at the point in the US rate cycle where we expect to adjust back-book pricing to accommodate our larger clients, but do so in a disciplined manner and usually as part of a broader relationship discussion, a balancing trade for fee opportunities. Foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower in the 45% to 50% range. We've also included a new slide in the appendix, page 16 that shows our NII trends over the past few rate cycles. I think it will be -- it will put the larger NII increases and decreases in context, which are driven by many factors, including changes in interest rates, the pacing of hikes, deposit levels and mix, Fed balance sheet changes as well as equity markets. You can see from that page that our recent quarters have come with a much higher than usual level of NII and we are now normalizing to a more typical level of NII that is inherent in our business activities. Turning to slide 11. Second quarter expenses excluding notable items increased 6% year-on-year. Sequentially, excluding seasonal expenses, second quarter expenses increased just over 1% as we actively manage the expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations, automation. On a line-by-line basis year-on-year, compensation employee benefits increased 7%, primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation and higher headcount attributable primarily to operational staff for growth areas, technology staff, insourcing and some lower attrition, lower than expected attrition rate. Sequentially, however, we have managed the headcount to be flat. Information systems and communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and credits related to vendor savings initiative. Transaction processing decreased 2%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs from vendor credits. Occupancy increased 7% as we relocated our headquarters building temporarily resulting in overlapping costs and other expenses were up 7%, mainly reflecting higher professional fees. Moving to slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate our operating environment with very strong capital levels, which remained well above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.8% was down 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained earnings. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was flat quarter-on-quarter at 108% and decreased four percentage points quarter-on-quarter, but still quite high at 120% for State Street Bank and Trust. We're also very happy with our performance on this year's CCAR with the calculated stress capital buffer well above the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a continued preliminary SCB at the floor. This demonstrates we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. In keeping with our results, in June, we announced the planned 10% increase for our 3Q '23 quarterly common stock dividend, subject to Board approval and it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our current authorization of up to a total of $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan another $1 billion buyback in third quarter. Lastly, we are quite pleased to return roughly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the second quarter '23, consisting of just over $1 billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Turning to slide 13, which provides the summary of our second quarter results. While there is certainly still work to do, we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a mixed and divergent backdrop. Robust expansion of our front office solutions area and continued momentum in securities finance as well as strong growth in net interest income enables us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in the other fee areas highlighting the resiliency of the franchise. Next I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding our third quarter. At a macro-level, while we know that rate expectations have been moving, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggest that the Fed, the ECB and the BOE will all continue to hike in 3Q to varying degrees. In terms of average equity markets, we currently expect US equity markets to be up about 5% quarter-on-quarter as we are expecting equity markets to remain flat from now to quarter-end, and we expect international equity markets to be flattish on average. Regarding fee revenue in 3Q, on a sequential-quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be down approximately 1% to 1.5%, with servicing fees down 1% to 2% as the below-average fee repricing headwinds we saw this past quarter is expected to normalize in 3Q. This will also include a revenue headwind from the previously disclosed client exit. We expect management fees to be up around 0.5% to 1.5%. We expect front office software and data quarter-on-quarter to be down 7%, as we do not expect the level of on-premise renewals in 3Q that we saw this quarter. We expect the other fee revenue line to come in around $30 million to $35 million in 3Q which is higher than prior years but down post the accounting change impact in 2Q. Regarding NII, after three double-digit sequential increases in NII last year, we now expect NII to decrease 12% to 18% on a sequential-quarter basis, driven by lower deposit levels and continued rotation as rate hikes continue into 3Q. Our outlook assumes that average non-interest-bearing deposits declined by approximately $5 billion from 2Q to 3Q. As we look forward to 4Q, we do expect to see some moderation to the amount of deposit rotation as we work through most of our back-book and most central banks begin to pause. With that context, we expect that 4Q NII decline to be much less somewhere in the range of down 2% to 6% versus 3Q, and we expect NII to then stabilize around those levels, but it will depend on market conditions. And our expectation is that 4Q declines in non-interest-bearing deposits will be small as well likely in the down to a $3 billion range versus 3Q. Turning to expenses, we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment, and we expect to take action in 3Q to bend the cost curve. As such, we expect that expenses will be down 0.5% to 1% on a sequential-quarter basis and intend to continue to actively manage expenses. As always, this is on an ex-notables basis and we're keeping an eye on the FDIC assessment, which could be a 3Q notable item. And as I noted previously, given the accounting changes we adopted this quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22% for third quarter. With that let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric, I'd like to sort of double-click on some of the comments that you made about deposits. So you talked about back-book pricing in the US dollar book. Does that mean that we should be thinking about the potential for betas to exceed 100% here when that starts to work through? And what kind of magnitude do you think that could reach? And could you also help me understand the euro because when I look in the financial supplement in the breakout by currency, it looks like the euro deposit costs were up about low 40s bps quarter-over-quarter which seems like a beta that's a good deal, higher than the 50% you referenced. I know there's some swap noise so maybe that's what it is, but could you maybe flesh that out a bit for me?\nEric Aboaf: Brennan, sure. Let me start on the on the betas that we saw in particularly on the US book because we are at a period in the interest-rate cycle where we've now had multiple 50 basis points moved. It's been a very strong signal to our clients that rates are much, much higher and much more quickly and much more visibly. And at the same time, they now have because of that highly inverted yield curve, they have real substitute alternatives that they used to not have in the past, whether it's treasuries, whether it's money market, whether it's repo. There's a range of what they can invest in. And what we found is that our larger clients and you know we primarily have large sophisticated clients are quite active and thinking about their alternatives and then that has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed. If we think about the US deposit betas, they were in the 80% to 90% range last couple of quarters. This quarter we saw 100% and, yes, we expect next quarter we'll be well over 100% and what's driving that is really a catch-up in the back-book. We have clients coming to us as you'd expect, just like it happens with retail deposits for retail banks, but we have sophisticated large clients coming back and saying, look, some of our lower transactional rate levels or mid-tier rate levels are something that they like us to adjust. And in a way, what I think we -- has played out is that while spreads widened for us on the deposit, but for some period of time, we're now seeing a convergence back to where they would have been. And that's coming through and so what we have in the cycle is actually a number of quarters of below 100% betas, then we get to a 100% beta and then we are going to have a quarter where betas are well-above that 100% level. And it's really a catch-up in the back-book and that's what's playing through. It is what is beginning to drive this higher reduction in NII this quarter, the 10% quarter-on-quarter that you saw. You saw in my outlook, we are expecting 12% to 18% reduction in NII this coming quarter. And if you peel that apart, some of that is the continued rotation out of non-interest-bearing, but some of it and in good part of it is this catch-up in the back-book that's playing through. We do think that over time, we've seen the bulk of that and that will begin to moderate and I'm certainly happy to go into that and some of our perspective as we drill down deeply into our areas, but that's the context. On your other question on euros, we should probably follow up. I think we see betas quarter-on-quarter of about 50%, but we should probably just follow up offline because I think that's deep in the supplement and probably do that with you and the IR team.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay, no problem. And then another question just quickly on fee revenue. You flagged that the large client migration is going to be part of the outlook. How much of that will be impacting the third quarter delta? And then how much will be -- how should we be thinking about the timeframe for whatever is left and when that would end up playing out?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, I think the broader context, as you recall, Brennan, is that we disclosed that large client deconversion was going to happen over multiple years. We announced it well over a year ago and we described it in our K at about 1.7% of fee revenue. So you can calculate that through. I think in our fourth quarter earnings call in January, I described that we had seen about $20 million on a run-rate come out, but I can reconfirm that. In the next quarter third -- this coming third quarter we'll see about $20 million come out sequentially. And then in the fourth quarter, there's another piece of about another $15 million that will come out as well. And then after that, it's several more quarters before we see the later and final installments. But that's incorporated into our guide.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning, guys. So just maybe staying on the deposit question for another minute. Why do you guys think this catch-up happening now sort of late in the cycle? We've obviously been in a higher rate environment for well over a year. So curious if you can provide more color on particular customer segments in the US that's driving that and sort of the discussions around that? And then maybe as you sort of think about the end state for US interest-bearing deposits, I think, you're at 3.5 or so today. The cumulative beta on that is, I think, is around 70% relative to the Fed funds rate. Should we think of that approaching, I don't know, 85%, 90% kind of how do you think about where that deposit price in the US will stabilize?\nEric Aboaf: Alex, it's a good question. I mean, we're clearly navigating and living through an interesting environment that we've not seen in two decades, right? You've got to go back pre-crisis before you see 5% prevailing rates. I think if you -- if you also think about how swiftly we've gotten to where we are, that's why we created -- we put some of this information back on page 16 in our materials. You see this cycle has moved twice as far in terms of the uptick in rates in half the time of the last cycle. And so what plays out as that happens is that we always have clients that, as rates move up, they begin discussing with us and engaging with us on what would be appropriate maybe putting in place multiple balance tiers, having discussions about their expectations, we negotiate and so forth. And you can imagine large client discussions occur over three, six, sometimes even nine-month periods. And so if you kind of turn back the clock and say, when did some of those discussions occur, some of them early ones may have started second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, fourth quarter of last year because there was also a perspective among our clients and us for that matter, that rates might continue to 5%, but they might have gone to 4% or 3%, which would have put us and our clients in a different position from a NIM and NII and rate-setting perspective. So I think it's really the speed of this that has played out and on one hand. And on the other, the inverted yield curve gives clients and the prevalence of the money funds and treasuries and so forth, give clients an alternative, right, that's more vivid, I'd say, than in some of the past cycles. And so that's the kind of client behavior. What we have seen is that if you decompose our book, some of this activity is in the non-interest-bearing deposits, which have come down. And some of it is in the interest-bearing back-book because some clients with non-interest-bearing deposits come to us and say, look, can you make them now interest-bearing at a certain rate. And what we've seen is some real segmentation of that book. As an example, the average account in non-interest-bearing, there's about 30,000 accounts. The average account is barely over $1 million. What you can do in some of the analytic work we've done is separate out the higher balance non-interest-bearing clients and client accounts from lower balance ones. Not surprisingly, the higher balance accounts are down year-over-year in balance terms by 70%, right. The large number of smaller accounts are down by 15%. And so this is where what we're starting to work through with the -- what I'll describe is the burn down. How much of the larger deposits and non-interest-bearing have migrated to interest-bearing, right, at what rate. And our perspective is that we are now working through, I'll describe as a catch-up on the back-book. Some of that is non-interest-bearing deposits moving to interest-bearing and some of that is interest-bearing being priced up. And as we think about it, we think that the peak of that catch-up will play out in third quarter as we scan the deposit types, the larger, more sophisticated clients versus the smaller clients. And that's why we expect both the catch-up to continue into the third quarter and likely peak in the third quarter and then begin to moderate in the fourth quarter and to burn down.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. And then like just the end game in terms of what you ultimately think US deposit cost is going to look like relative to kind of the 3.5 and the Fed funds at 5?\nEric Aboaf: I think it's -- I've not calculated directly on a cost versus rate basis, on a NIM basis, but I guess we could back into it if it'd be helpful to you. As we think about the long range view of NII on our book, I've given some guidance for 3Q NII, for 4Q NII. I think our instinct is that NII will settle in this $550 million to $600 million range per quarter. And if it's helpful, we can try to calculate that back into spread on assets or a spread or a cost of funds on deposits and follow up with you.\nAlexander Blostein: I got you. That's helpful. Thanks. And my bigger picture question for you guys and to Ron as well as I think you mentioned productivity efforts in light of the fact that NII has clearly become a bigger headwind over the next several quarters and you guided servicing fees down in the third quarter. So as you think about measuring those productivities, are you solving for overall pre-tax margin stability? Are you solving for kind of fee margin stability sort of like ex-NII? How should we think about sort of measuring the productivity efforts in light of a more challenging revenue backdrop?\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Yes. Alex, I mean, where we start with is, I mean, because what you're describing is outcomes of the productivity efforts where we've -- and these are not new, these are ongoing. We really start with how do we create more scale in our business. How do we increase speed, lower error rates, increase client satisfaction, take out manual interventions. So the measures that we're using would be the traditional productivity measures and this has been underway now for several years. You've been seeing the results in our -- and we've been able to manage costs certainly relative to others. But in terms of how we think about the business going forward, particularly given that NII is no longer a tailwind in terms of an outcome basis, we really think about the operating leverage, I think, is the key outcome we're managing to, if that's the question you're asking.\nAlexander Blostein: Yeah, the operating leverage. Got it. All right. Thank you very much.\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nRob Wildhack: Good morning, guys. Just trying to ask about the asset side and the securities book quickly. Decent uplift in yield again plus 21 basis points. Can you give some color, some numbers around the front book, back-book difference there? And how much repricing can sort of assist NII going forward?\nEric Aboaf: Rob, it's Eric. There is a good bit of tailwind that comes from the front book, back-book. I think this on a kind of year-on-year basis, long rates were quite constructive from a year-on-year NII standpoint, the long rate tailwind year-on-year was in the $100 million basis. So it's quite substantial. On a quarter-on-quarter, the long rate tailwind is closer to $15 million, $20 million. So it's not insubstantial. And I think as we see some steepness in the curve come back or I guess I'll describe less inversion, we've got some, we've got abilities to leg into duration or curve position or, in some cases, some amount of convexity where we'd find it helpful. From a rate standpoint, like you said, average rates on the investment portfolio in aggregate was 270 basis points or so. The runoff is a good bit below that kind of in the 180 basis point range, so 90 basis points, 100 basis points south of that. And the roll-on that occurs is well above that 270 basis point average is closer to 410 basis points or more. So you've got a nice tailwind there that's playing through. We also have a tailwind on short rates for international currencies. So that's helpful. And then we are -- we continue to invest and think about opportunities across currency from a basis standpoint and so forth and we've got some latitude to do that as well given our global balance sheet.\nRob Wildhack: Thanks, Eric. And then one more just on the operational deposits. If I use the numbers on page 10, operational or excuse me overall deposits are down -- operational deposits are down as a percentage of the mix. Conceptually, what would be driving that? I guess I'm confused as to why operational deposits would be down year-over-year more than non-operational deposits.\nEric Aboaf: Yes. I think there's a little bit of -- I look at that data and I think you've got roughly similar movements in operational and non-operational deposits. I think what's happening in this part of the cycle is as deposits or I'll say, as cash for our clients is more valuable, right? They are selectively thinking about how much cash do I absolutely must keep in the -- in their custodial accounts. And if you think about it, they make that decision in, I think it's more than 100,000 different accounts themselves, right? It's a very large and disparate set of decisions and sub decisions by 100,000 plus fund managers and many, many fund boards. And so they're trying to see, hey, can I edge it down, and that's why at this point in the cycle, you see total deposits drift down, but also operational. What they end up needing to trade off and the reason why it will level off over time is that they need a certain amount of deposits that they don't overdraw. They -- fund managers really hate the overdraw at the end of day. And then there's also a governor where we engage with our clients on intraday and make sure that they have enough cash to cover their transactional flow and throughput, but we're just at the period where in the core custody accounts, you've got this drift downwards where they're trying to optimize without going too far and that's what you're seeing. But this is expected. We expect the operational deposits to stay comfortably in this kind of 75% range. And it's a part of the kind of custodial operations, which is what makes them so sticky, right, because they need to be there for the very significant daily, hourly and minute-by-minute transactional flows that we are processing on their behalf so that they aren't overdrawn.\nRob Wildhack: Okay. Thanks, Eric.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks, Eric. Maybe just a different attempt of the deposit discussion. So I get clients wanting more yield. I bought treasurers too, we all did. But is there any point where the client profitability discussion has teed. Like are they able to move 100% of non-operating deposits if they want, like what discussions you're having with them about doing more with State Street areas like FX like lending, alpha. But maybe you could update us on what you're doing to try to help impact what seems like you can't impact the deposit side. So is there anything else you can do?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Let me start there, Glenn, and I think Ron will weigh in as well because a number of us have these engaging conversations with clients. I think from a burn down standpoint, let me first take it from that angle is if you think about our $200 billion of deposits, we've got deposits at a number of different price tiers and we have kind of very large sophisticated clients and then kind of that large tail of small and midsized clients. Of the $200 billion, we think there's about $50 billion that we've been very focused on and continue to be focused on. So about a quarter of our total deposits are with these clients that as we've talked about the last couple of questions, there's been a real catch-up on the back book. I described that because of that $50 billion, which is either a very low price or zero price for our larger and most sophisticated clients, where we have these engaging and balance of trade discussions, right? We've around -- we've got about $25 billion that's behind us, where largely, we've repriced those deposits. We've had those discussions and some of those have come with some balance of trade improvements or some commitments on stability on fees, and those are behind us. Included in the outlook that I provide beyond the $25 billion, there's another $15 billion that's underway right now. That's included in my third quarter outlook, right? So that gets us to $35 billion, almost $40 billion of the $50 million. And then there's a trail that we'll still have. And so I think from a client discussion and negotiation standpoint, the third quarter we expect to be the peak. I think what you'll find is that each of these questions on deposits, certainly, rates goes through a pricing committee from a balance sheet management standpoint. But very quickly, those go to the most senior client executives and all the way up to our C-suite because those are large. They're very large and that's where we engage. And I think what you'll see over time is some of that we'll come back through in FX revenues and sec lending revenues and the absence of fee rate reductions in the future, right, on one hand. And on the other hand, some of what we do here is also work with clients on expanding the range of what we do for them when it comes to managing their cash, right? I think some of the reason you're seeing the uptick in cash with in our asset management business because some of those clients say, look, I'd like to be in a cash money market sweep until we've been doing that. You see our repo business continues to do very, very well is actually an add to -- it's a stabilizer to NII or an add to NII on a year-on-year basis and stabilizing and it's a stable source of NII income quarter-on-quarter because we've been able to shift some of the client cash to those areas. So there are some offsets as well there. But that's a bit of a start.\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Yeah, Glenn, what I would add to what Eric said is that the -- if you think about over the last four, five years, our focus on pricing has been -- initially was on fee pricing and kind of addressing, if not combating the fee compression and really working that in an institutional way and in a very high skilled way and escalating those -- or elevating those decisions way above where they used to be. Deposits for -- up until this rate cycle really weren't part of that because, I mean, there were times that we would just assume not have had the deposits. We've now integrated that as Eric has implied into that discussion, but also included a full share of wallet analysis. And the part of this is recognizing that these institutions are very large. And when you have a pricing discussion and putting that in air quotes, it really depends on what it is. And what we have worked to avoid is to not have a series of unilateral discussions without understanding and making sure that at the highest levels of our clients, they understand the impact of this. And just reminding them that you have the fee you have because of this assumption on other services that we're going to provide you or some assumption on deposits. And those conversations are actually starting to work well. It's caused a change of process for us, another change of process for us. But more importantly, it's changed in the way how we're engaging and at what level we're engaging with these clients. And so more to go there, but we also think it's a skill, but now developed, will help us through various kinds of cycles going forward.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks for all that color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nSharon Leung: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Sharon Leung filling in for Steven. Just on the deposits, outside of the rotation out of NIB, can you talk about the overall trajectory of total deposits, particularly because it looks like more recent liquidity drawdown has come out of RRP instead of deposits. So just wanted to get your thoughts on the expectations for the trajectory on deposits from here in the context of QT treasury issuance, et cetera?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, it's Eric. It's hard to really gauge the deposit changes outright. I think we're a little more focused on the net interest, I'm sorry, the non-interest-bearing deposits where we've signaled another $5 billion likely outflow this coming quarter. That's less of an outflow than in the second quarter. So you're starting to see some of the burn down that I've described. In the external environment, I think, from the H8 reports those banks, we've seen about a 2% sequential fall in deposits. For the trust banks, we tend to have more deposits coming in when deposits in the bank system increase and we have somewhat more coming out when deposit the bank system come out and probably just the absolute sophistication of our clients. So we're -- we expect a downtick in deposits again next quarter, but just been a little more focused on the non-interest-bearing because that's where it makes a big difference. I think there is always some movement in interest-bearing deposits, especially at the higher rate tier because what we're finding increasingly as we get to a little more of this as we expect to get to a time stabilization or at least a little more of a balance with our clients. Now what they're going to do is it's hard for them to move an underlying operating deposit that actually has to cover the hundreds, thousands, in some cases, tens of thousands of transactions that are flowing through their particular account, but sometimes they'll move the thin margin deposits to a treasury. And so we might lose 10 basis points on something and they'll pick up 10 basis points on treasury. So there's some of that that's going on. And I think in truth that's not as dominant as a driver of our NII at this point.\nSharon Leung: Thanks for that. And as a follow-up, just on some of the updated capital rules that are coming. I understand you probably won't be able to give much color because we haven't seen a proposal yet. But just in terms of like expected ways you might be able to mitigate some of that impact and which businesses might be more impacted for you guys?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, I mean, there's -- obviously, we're like many waiting to see more from the rules. We've -- the last time we saw Basel III and game draft from either the US or international regulators was several years back. So I think we've -- we expect some higher capital requirements, just hard to tell how much. We do think there'll be effects on different parts of our businesses. So the new rules will come with an operational deposit operational capital charge. That probably will be relatively hard to influence because we actually want to build our fee-driven businesses. And so those, I think, will just come with a capital requirement that's -- that will be an add. There'll be some reduction on the lending book, so that will be helpful. And then I think in particular, while the fundamental review of the trading book will affect the universal banks potentially in a negative way. For us, the sec finance business will tend to be a positive, will be in a positive territory where capital requirements will be less. We'll no longer need to hold capital to indemnify treasury. So they'll finally become economically more rational in the safer areas, right, as they should be. They should obviously -- capital needs to be held for the riskier activities. But we don't traffic in the riskier areas. And I think that, in some ways, that will give us an opportunity to grow those areas that are quite aligned with our client base like sec finance and actually deploy capital more actively. And so I think there'll be a mix of impacts, we're going to see as it comes through, but I like many were -- we're considering what's to come and we'll react accordingly as it does.\nSharon Leung: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Amidst Ron, I guess I wanted to come back to your comments on the, basically, the overall revenue per client, if I can sort of summarize it that way. Obviously, there are different components of how clients, the asset servicing clients pay for the business, and there are many different ways aside from the core fees that they can do that. So as you think about that across the client base, I know you have looked at this more holistically across clients over many, many years. But with the deposit beta going up, is that sort of revenue per client going down? Or do you think you're able to actually be able to improve the fee rate given that they aren't paying as much on the compensating balances?\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Brian, it's a good question. And what I was referring to and what you're referring to is what I would call how we think about this tactically client by client, but I also want to come back to the strategic elements of this also. In terms of -- there's no one answer for any particular client because if you think about it, in the core back office business, you've got custody fund accounting and there's a pricing element to that along typically with associated deposits. In more and more instances, obviously, we've -- a client might have a middle office assignment with us where we're doing -- we are their back office and obviously going all the way to Alpha. And then there's the question of are we doing FX and securities finance with them? Obviously, FX is a function of are they -- do they have occasion to use FX? And increasingly, most managers do, securities finance manager, line managers. So the reason why I'm saying it's tactical, it's -- there's a holistic conversation that needs to occur here. And it's important on both sides, ours included, to lay out for the client that remember all we did for you over the past few years to get you through whatever fee challenges they were having, that was predicated on X. And X might be an assumed deposit level, it might be on an assumed FX level, X isn't playing out. We need to have a conversation on this. And that could, in cases, lead to more fees or it could and the more typical outcome is that, well, hey, we're not doing this with you, let's try and do that or even there's a set of funds over here that we've never talked about, whatever Cayman Islands or something, and let's see if we can move those. I mean the positive situation is a challenge. The conversations it's spurring are opportunities. And there are real opportunities. There's senior people intimately involved in these because we don't get a lot of redos on them. This is the moment to be doing it. So we think it's a way to, I mean, again, the kind of NII outflow is a significant headwind, but we think it's an opportunity to mitigate some of it. The strategic side of this, Brian, I don't want to lose, right? Because going back to the acquisition of Charles River, the launch of Alpha, all the development we've been doing, we're now seeing onboarding happening there. With the typical onboarding journey tends to be the lower fee complicated kind of middle office stuff starts first. And then there's follow-on services. And it's making sure that we are implementing, addressing and implementing those follow-on services as fast as possible. So when we talked earlier and talked about the onboarding, I talked about that we were able to move a little over $1 trillion into to be onboarded to onboarded. What will follow there is other services and increase kind of the revenue per asset per -- I mean that's the way Alpha works and that's the way Alpha is going to play out, which is why notwithstanding the short-term issues that Eric has raised in terms of we've got this client transition. We're actually quite optimistic over the -- what I would call the short to medium term as we look into 2024 about the revenue picture.\nBrian Bedell: That's great color. And then maybe just on the expense side, Eric, you mentioned the expense levers. Are they more tactical in nature? Or do you see sort of an ability to reengineer -- continue to reengineer the cost base. You've already done a great job in reducing costs structurally over the last several years. I don't know if we're like mostly through that and when you do have the cost saves you reinvest them in growth initiatives? Or is there an ability to sort of reduce the overall cost structure?\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Brian, let me address that first, and then Eric will comment. The -- we are definitely not through this. And by that, I mean, when we started down this journey a couple of years ago, we obviously addressed call it, which you want the lower-hanging fruit, the kinds of things that we could get at without a lot of technology investment, without a lot of reengineering, but there is more to do, and we're making a lot of progress on it. We've got people in place now on both the operations reengineering side and on the technology side that are working this through. The way this has played through in our results, you've seen what our expenses have been, but we've also been able to invest more in the businesses than we otherwise would. And we think that, that journey has more to go, and you'll see that and we'll report on that quarter after quarter. What we also talked about, though, is that there's some tactical things that we can do and should do just given the kind of outlook that we've described to you. And those would be less about reengineering and more about how do we think about short-term things like consensus and those things.\nEric Aboaf: And just to round that out, we've got to pay for performance. So when we have larger -- we deliver larger sales, we'll pay for that when it's a little lighter. As you saw, we'll reign that in, and that's part of the execution mines that we have. We've also just given some of the evolution on salary increases and that we've all worked through over the last couple of quarters over the last year. We also feel like it's time where we have enough staff and so we've put in place a hiring freeze because we need to contain our staffing costs. So we need to make sure as we reengineer, we actually redeploy our folks to, say, new business areas or to growth areas and actually pair down others. And the way to do that in a more emphatic way tactically, right, is to be particularly disciplined on hiring, and freeze that or just limit it. And so given the short-term performance, we're doing that as well, which gives you a sense for our willingness to bend the cost curve.\nBrian Bedell: That's great color. Thanks very much, Ron and Eric.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ron O'Hanley for closing remarks.\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Well, thanks, operator, and thanks to all in the call for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Ronald P. O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our second quarter financial results. Relative to the significant volatility experienced by investors in the first quarter, market conditions in 2Q were more subdued and global financial market performance is varied. Global equities generated positive returns for the third consecutive quarter as investors saw continued strength in developed equity markets, but weakness in emerging markets. Fixed income market sell as investors had to contend was still elevated levels of inflation and further central bank rate hikes, including the Federal Reserve raising interest rates above 5% for the first time since 2007. The second quarter was also characterized by falling currency market volatility, which created headwinds for our foreign exchange business. Turning to slide three of our investor presentation, I will review our second quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, second quarter ROE was 13% and pre-tax margin expanded by 1.2 percentage points year-over-year to 29.5%. Relative to the year-ago period, 2Q EPS increased by 14% to $2.17 supported by our common share repurchases, significantly higher NII, strong front office software and data revenue growth and an increase in securities finance revenue. Our results also benefited from the release of an allowance related to the support of a financial -- US financial institution as well as an accounting adoption. Taken together, these factors more than offset headwinds in some of our other fee-based businesses and the impact of higher-than-desired year-over-year expense growth. Turning to our business momentum, in Q1, I highlighted that by strengthening our implementation capabilities, we have a line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding this year. We began to realize the benefits of this plan and onboarded $1.2 trillion of AUC/A during the second quarter, primarily driven by State Street Alpha, underscoring the power of the Alpha value proposition to our investment services strategy and long-term growth. As a result, our AUC/A installation backlog declined to $2.4 trillion, while total AUC/A increased by 5% quarter-over-quarter to $39.6 trillion, both at quarter-end in part as a result of this new business. We also recorded over $140 billion of asset servicing wins in the second quarter, largely driven by strong sales in the desirable asset owner, official institutions and alternatives client segments. Our sales pipeline grew and we expect substantial on-boardings in the coming quarters. We continue to advance and broaden our enterprise outsource solutions strategy across our clients' front, middle and back-office activities, as demonstrated by the expansion of Alpha's capabilities to ETFs, which we announced in 2Q. For the past 30 years, State Street has continuously innovated to support what has become a $10 trillion ETF market. Today, State Street is the largest ETF administrator in the world with more than 2,700 ETF serviced in 13 countries. That long cycle of innovation continues as State Street Alpha now supports the entire ETF lifecycle. By integrating CRD's front office products with State Street's industry-leading ETF servicing capabilities, Alpha now provides a centralized platform for ETFs issuers across the entire ETF lifecycle, including portfolio management, trading and compliance to enable the growth across a variety of ETF strategies and increased speed-to-market. Turning to front office software and data business, our overall CRD pipeline is strong. In the second quarter, we converted a meaningful number of on-prem CRD clients to recurring SaaS revenue, which when coupled with new SaaS client implementations, increased annual recurring revenue by 12% relative to the year-ago period. In addition, Charles River Wealth Management Solution continues to resonate with clients and drove a significant increase in on-prem revenues this quarter. Year-to-date, CRD's wealth-driven revenue has more than doubled as compared to the first half of 2022 and we remain on track to grow CRD's wealth revenue this year. The State Street Global Advisors quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.8 trillion, supported by higher period-end market levels and $38 billion of net inflows from all three business lines, ETF, cash and institutional. Our SPDR ETF business gathered $27 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, including $20 billion of net inflows into SPY, the industry's largest ETF. We also delivered a solid performance in our US low-cost ETF segment, which gathered $7 billion of net inflows in the quarter, continuing to gain market share. Our cash business gathered a solid $10 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, as our US government money market funds benefited from the attractiveness of the cash asset class in the higher-rate environment. Turning to our financial condition, State Street's balance sheet, liquidity and capital positions remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 11.8% at quarter-end, well above our regulatory minimum. The ongoing capital generation of our business, coupled with effective balance sheet management and our strong capital position has enabled us to deliver against our goal of returning significant capital to our shareholders. In 2Q, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of capital, buying back more than $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means that cumulatively over the last three quarters to the end of June, we have returned approximately $4.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends. The strength of our balance sheet was also highlighted with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test results in June, following which, we announced our intention for the third year in a row to increase State Street's common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter, subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors. It remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our existing authorization for up to $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, financial market conditions in the second quarter were mixed. Although global equities recorded another sequential quarter of growth, there was weakness in emerging markets and we witnessed the negative impact of persistent inflation and further central bank rate hikes on fixed-income markets. Meanwhile, both equity and currency volatility continued to decline. Despite this varied backdrop, we achieved a number of positive outcomes in the second quarter, including meaningfully reducing our asset servicing backlog, further developing our Alpha capabilities, continuing to record new asset servicing wins, driving strong growth in front office software and data revenue and gathering solid net inflows at Global Advisors. And while we reached double-digit year-over-year EPS growth supported by our capital management and the higher interest-rate environment, our results were below our potential. First, while we achieved sequential fee revenue growth in areas of our business this quarter, we need to demonstrate the fee growth every quarter especially as NII. We need to demonstrate that fee growth every quarter especially as NII is no longer a tailwind. And second, we are highly focused on controlling our expense base. We have a well-established track record of reengineering our processes and transforming our operations in order to improve our efficiency and realized productivity growth. We plan to utilize additional tactical expense levers at our disposal in addition to our ongoing structural productivity efforts in order to support our financial performance for the benefit of our shareholders. Now let me hand the call over to Eric who'll take you through the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Yes. Alex, I mean, where we start with is, I mean, because what you're describing is outcomes of the productivity efforts where we've -- and these are not new, these are ongoing. We really start with how do we create more scale in our business. How do we increase speed, lower error rates, increase client satisfaction, take out manual interventions. So the measures that we're using would be the traditional productivity measures and this has been underway now for several years. You've been seeing the results in our -- and we've been able to manage costs certainly relative to others. But in terms of how we think about the business going forward, particularly given that NII is no longer a tailwind in terms of an outcome basis, we really think about the operating leverage, I think, is the key outcome we're managing to, if that's the question you're asking. Thanks. Yeah, Glenn, what I would add to what Eric said is that the -- if you think about over the last four, five years, our focus on pricing has been -- initially was on fee pricing and kind of addressing, if not combating the fee compression and really working that in an institutional way and in a very high skilled way and escalating those -- or elevating those decisions way above where they used to be.

And just reminding them that you have the fee you have because of this assumption on other services that we're going to provide you or some assumption on deposits. And those conversations are actually starting to work well. It's caused a change of process for us, another change of process for us. But more importantly, it's changed in the way how we're engaging and at what level we're engaging with these clients. And so more to go there, but we also think it's a skill, but now developed, will help us through various kinds of cycles going forward. Brian, it's a good question. And what I was referring to and what you're referring to is what I would call how we think about this tactically client by client, but I also want to come back to the strategic elements of this also.

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on slide four. We reported EPS of $2.17 for the quarter, an increase of 14% relative to the second quarter a year ago. As you can see on the left panel of this slide, revenue grew by 5% year-on-year, driven by the expansion in our front-office solutions area, where we are an industry leader, continued momentum in securities finance business as well as strong growth in net interest income. This growth enabled us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in other fee areas given the relatively mixed macroeconomic backdrop. We also had the benefit of an accounting change for tax credit investments, which simplifies our reporting going forward. While our overall year-on-year fee growth was less than we would have liked to deliver, we did see sequential quarter revenue momentum and a step up in the sales pipeline, which we expect to build upon in the coming quarters and which I'll discuss later in today's presentation. As we drive growth, we continue to prudently invest in the business while remaining focused on managing costs given the current operating environment, and we stand ready to further intervene on expenses should the softness in the global environment persists. Turning now to slide five. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 4% on a year-on-year basis and 5% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period-end equity market levels and client net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of the significant trillion-dollar Alpha installation and higher period-end market levels. At Global Advisors, we saw similar positive dynamics play out in the quarter. Period-end AUM increased 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially. The year-on-year increase in AUM was largely driven by higher period-end market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was also due to higher period-end market levels as well as strong sequential net inflows. Turning to slide six. On the left side of the page, you'll see second quarter total servicing fees down 3% year-on-year as net-new business in the quarter was more than offset by lower client activities and adjustments largely due to lower custody and transaction volume and better than usual pricing headwinds. Positive year-on-year equity markets were offset by the negative impact of fixed-income markets. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 3% primarily as a result of higher average market levels and net-new business slightly offset by better-than-usual pricing headwinds this quarter. We had a more constructive market environment relative to the first quarter as well as a significant onboarding of $1.2 trillion of AUC/A related to an Alpha client in the asset manager client segment, which comes at a modest fee rate, but with services are expected to be added in the coming years. Within servicing fees, back-office servicing fees were generally consistent with total servicing fees and largely driven by the factors I just described. Middle office services fees performance was meaningfully more positive for the quarter. On a year-on-year basis, fees were up 3% primarily reflecting net-new business and up 10% sequentially, largely driven by the installation that I just mentioned. On the bottom panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators which highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. While total AUC/A wins in the second quarter were not as robust in volume terms, client engagement remained healthy and we saw wins across strategic segments, including mandates and asset owners, official institutions and alternatives, which are key growth areas for us as we previously mentioned. The wins including those in the alternatives segment, which are more complex to service come with above-average fee rates. We have also seen a healthy uptick in our pipeline this quarter. Turning to slide seven. Second quarter management fees were $461 million, down 6% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the impact of net outflows from prior periods, a shift of certain management fees into NII as previously described and some pricing headwinds, partially offset by higher average market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 1% as a result of higher market levels and cash net inflows. As you can see on the bottom-right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well-positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of our three lines of business. In ETFs, we saw very strong net inflows of $27 billion into SPY and our sector suite of ETFs as well as our SPDR portfolio low-cost suite. In our institutional business, we saw net inflows with continued momentum in our well-established index fixed-income and defined contribution franchises. Across our cash franchise, we continue to see strong demand for our money market funds. We recorded net inflows of $10 billion. Turning to slide eight. Relative to the period a year ago, second quarter FX trading services revenue was down 8% year-on-year and 11% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes and lower industry FX volatility. Relative to the period a year-ago, both volumes and volatility were more muted as the start of the war in Europe last year caused unusually high FX trading activity in the first half of 2022. Many clients were also risk-off during the debt ceiling discussions in April and May, with a rebound in June and client volumes falling its resolution. Altogether 2Q is muted. We are optimistic about 3Q, but it's hard to predict. Securities finance performed well in the second quarter with revenues up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher agency spreads. Sequentially, revenues were up 7%, again mainly driven by higher agency spreads as well as higher prime services or enhanced custody revenues from deeper client engagement and specials activity, partially offset by lower balances. Moving on to software and processing fees. Second quarter software and processing fees were up 18% year-on-year and 34% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD which I will turn to shortly. Lending fees for the quarter were down 5% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix, but up 5% sequentially, mainly driven by strong client demand for lines of credit. Finally, other fee revenue increased $101 million year-on-year, primarily due to a tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market-related adjustments. This includes the impact of the new accounting adoption. Moving to slide nine, you'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 29% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher on-premise renewals and continued growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services revenue as we continue to convert and implant more clients over to our SaaS environment. About 60% of our clients are now on our SaaS platform. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was up nearly 50%. About two-thirds of this uptick was driven by wealth management mandates that are becoming an increasingly important growth segment for us. Our sales pipeline continues to grow and remains strong for our Charles River development front office solutions products. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we were pleased, we had three more Alpha mandates go live, which brings our total live Alpha clients to 15, and as I previously mentioned, we installed a significant portion of assets related to Alpha this quarter. We expect to provide more services related to these assets in the future, helping us increase the share of our client's wallet. Now turning to slide 10. Second quarter NII increased 18% year-on-year, but declined 10% sequentially to $691 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-term rates and increase in long-term rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower average deposits. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by our continued rotation of non-interest-bearing deposit balances and rate pressure in the US back-book, partially offset by higher short-term market rates from international central bank hikes. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Average deposits declined 2% quarter-on-quarter in line with industry total deposit trends, which also fell by 2% in the second quarter and reflect client preferences to shift some cash to other products during periods of rising rates. Our operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remained consistent at approximately 75%. Our global floating-rate loan book provides upside at this stage in the cycle and our investment portfolio positioning provides a tailwind as long rates roll through. We now also have the opportunity to selectively add some duration across the curve, as we see good entry points, which could enhance NII over time. Sequentially, US dollar client deposit betas were 100% during the second quarter, leading again to some sequential NII compression. We are now at the point in the US rate cycle where we expect to adjust back-book pricing to accommodate our larger clients, but do so in a disciplined manner and usually as part of a broader relationship discussion, a balancing trade for fee opportunities. Foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower in the 45% to 50% range. We've also included a new slide in the appendix, page 16 that shows our NII trends over the past few rate cycles. I think it will be -- it will put the larger NII increases and decreases in context, which are driven by many factors, including changes in interest rates, the pacing of hikes, deposit levels and mix, Fed balance sheet changes as well as equity markets. You can see from that page that our recent quarters have come with a much higher than usual level of NII and we are now normalizing to a more typical level of NII that is inherent in our business activities. Turning to slide 11. Second quarter expenses excluding notable items increased 6% year-on-year. Sequentially, excluding seasonal expenses, second quarter expenses increased just over 1% as we actively manage the expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations, automation. On a line-by-line basis year-on-year, compensation employee benefits increased 7%, primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation and higher headcount attributable primarily to operational staff for growth areas, technology staff, insourcing and some lower attrition, lower than expected attrition rate. Sequentially, however, we have managed the headcount to be flat. Information systems and communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and credits related to vendor savings initiative. Transaction processing decreased 2%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs from vendor credits. Occupancy increased 7% as we relocated our headquarters building temporarily resulting in overlapping costs and other expenses were up 7%, mainly reflecting higher professional fees. Moving to slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate our operating environment with very strong capital levels, which remained well above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.8% was down 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained earnings. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was flat quarter-on-quarter at 108% and decreased four percentage points quarter-on-quarter, but still quite high at 120% for State Street Bank and Trust. We're also very happy with our performance on this year's CCAR with the calculated stress capital buffer well above the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a continued preliminary SCB at the floor. This demonstrates we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. In keeping with our results, in June, we announced the planned 10% increase for our 3Q '23 quarterly common stock dividend, subject to Board approval and it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our current authorization of up to a total of $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan another $1 billion buyback in third quarter. Lastly, we are quite pleased to return roughly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the second quarter '23, consisting of just over $1 billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Turning to slide 13, which provides the summary of our second quarter results. While there is certainly still work to do, we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a mixed and divergent backdrop. Robust expansion of our front office solutions area and continued momentum in securities finance as well as strong growth in net interest income enables us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in the other fee areas highlighting the resiliency of the franchise. Next I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding our third quarter. At a macro-level, while we know that rate expectations have been moving, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggest that the Fed, the ECB and the BOE will all continue to hike in 3Q to varying degrees. In terms of average equity markets, we currently expect US equity markets to be up about 5% quarter-on-quarter as we are expecting equity markets to remain flat from now to quarter-end, and we expect international equity markets to be flattish on average. Regarding fee revenue in 3Q, on a sequential-quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be down approximately 1% to 1.5%, with servicing fees down 1% to 2% as the below-average fee repricing headwinds we saw this past quarter is expected to normalize in 3Q. This will also include a revenue headwind from the previously disclosed client exit. We expect management fees to be up around 0.5% to 1.5%. We expect front office software and data quarter-on-quarter to be down 7%, as we do not expect the level of on-premise renewals in 3Q that we saw this quarter. We expect the other fee revenue line to come in around $30 million to $35 million in 3Q which is higher than prior years but down post the accounting change impact in 2Q. Regarding NII, after three double-digit sequential increases in NII last year, we now expect NII to decrease 12% to 18% on a sequential-quarter basis, driven by lower deposit levels and continued rotation as rate hikes continue into 3Q. Our outlook assumes that average non-interest-bearing deposits declined by approximately $5 billion from 2Q to 3Q. As we look forward to 4Q, we do expect to see some moderation to the amount of deposit rotation as we work through most of our back-book and most central banks begin to pause. With that context, we expect that 4Q NII decline to be much less somewhere in the range of down 2% to 6% versus 3Q, and we expect NII to then stabilize around those levels, but it will depend on market conditions. And our expectation is that 4Q declines in non-interest-bearing deposits will be small as well likely in the down to a $3 billion range versus 3Q. Turning to expenses, we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment, and we expect to take action in 3Q to bend the cost curve. As such, we expect that expenses will be down 0.5% to 1% on a sequential-quarter basis and intend to continue to actively manage expenses. As always, this is on an ex-notables basis and we're keeping an eye on the FDIC assessment, which could be a 3Q notable item. And as I noted previously, given the accounting changes we adopted this quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22% for third quarter. With that let me hand the call back to Ron. Brennan, sure. Let me start on the on the betas that we saw in particularly on the US book because we are at a period in the interest-rate cycle where we've now had multiple 50 basis points moved. It's been a very strong signal to our clients that rates are much, much higher and much more quickly and much more visibly. And at the same time, they now have because of that highly inverted yield curve, they have real substitute alternatives that they used to not have in the past, whether it's treasuries, whether it's money market, whether it's repo. There's a range of what they can invest in. And what we found is that our larger clients and you know we primarily have large sophisticated clients are quite active and thinking about their alternatives and then that has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed. If we think about the US deposit betas, they were in the 80% to 90% range last couple of quarters. This quarter we saw 100% and, yes, we expect next quarter we'll be well over 100% and what's driving that is really a catch-up in the back-book. We have clients coming to us as you'd expect, just like it happens with retail deposits for retail banks, but we have sophisticated large clients coming back and saying, look, some of our lower transactional rate levels or mid-tier rate levels are something that they like us to adjust. And in a way, what I think we -- has played out is that while spreads widened for us on the deposit, but for some period of time, we're now seeing a convergence back to where they would have been. And that's coming through and so what we have in the cycle is actually a number of quarters of below 100% betas, then we get to a 100% beta and then we are going to have a quarter where betas are well-above that 100% level. And it's really a catch-up in the back-book and that's what's playing through. It is what is beginning to drive this higher reduction in NII this quarter, the 10% quarter-on-quarter that you saw. You saw in my outlook, we are expecting 12% to 18% reduction in NII this coming quarter. And if you peel that apart, some of that is the continued rotation out of non-interest-bearing, but some of it and in good part of it is this catch-up in the back-book that's playing through. We do think that over time, we've seen the bulk of that and that will begin to moderate and I'm certainly happy to go into that and some of our perspective as we drill down deeply into our areas, but that's the context. On your other question on euros, we should probably follow up. I think we see betas quarter-on-quarter of about 50%, but we should probably just follow up offline because I think that's deep in the supplement and probably do that with you and the IR team. Yeah, I think the broader context, as you recall, Brennan, is that we disclosed that large client deconversion was going to happen over multiple years. We announced it well over a year ago and we described it in our K at about 1.7% of fee revenue. So you can calculate that through. I think in our fourth quarter earnings call in January, I described that we had seen about $20 million on a run-rate come out, but I can reconfirm that. In the next quarter third -- this coming third quarter we'll see about $20 million come out sequentially. And then in the fourth quarter, there's another piece of about another $15 million that will come out as well. And then after that, it's several more quarters before we see the later and final installments. But that's incorporated into our guide. Alex, it's a good question. I mean, we're clearly navigating and living through an interesting environment that we've not seen in two decades, right? You've got to go back pre-crisis before you see 5% prevailing rates. I think if you -- if you also think about how swiftly we've gotten to where we are, that's why we created -- we put some of this information back on page 16 in our materials. You see this cycle has moved twice as far in terms of the uptick in rates in half the time of the last cycle. And so what plays out as that happens is that we always have clients that, as rates move up, they begin discussing with us and engaging with us on what would be appropriate maybe putting in place multiple balance tiers, having discussions about their expectations, we negotiate and so forth. And you can imagine large client discussions occur over three, six, sometimes even nine-month periods. And so if you kind of turn back the clock and say, when did some of those discussions occur, some of them early ones may have started second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, fourth quarter of last year because there was also a perspective among our clients and us for that matter, that rates might continue to 5%, but they might have gone to 4% or 3%, which would have put us and our clients in a different position from a NIM and NII and rate-setting perspective. So I think it's really the speed of this that has played out and on one hand. And on the other, the inverted yield curve gives clients and the prevalence of the money funds and treasuries and so forth, give clients an alternative, right, that's more vivid, I'd say, than in some of the past cycles. And so that's the kind of client behavior. What we have seen is that if you decompose our book, some of this activity is in the non-interest-bearing deposits, which have come down. And some of it is in the interest-bearing back-book because some clients with non-interest-bearing deposits come to us and say, look, can you make them now interest-bearing at a certain rate. And what we've seen is some real segmentation of that book. As an example, the average account in non-interest-bearing, there's about 30,000 accounts. The average account is barely over $1 million. What you can do in some of the analytic work we've done is separate out the higher balance non-interest-bearing clients and client accounts from lower balance ones. Not surprisingly, the higher balance accounts are down year-over-year in balance terms by 70%, right. The large number of smaller accounts are down by 15%. And so this is where what we're starting to work through with the -- what I'll describe is the burn down. How much of the larger deposits and non-interest-bearing have migrated to interest-bearing, right, at what rate. And our perspective is that we are now working through, I'll describe as a catch-up on the back-book. Some of that is non-interest-bearing deposits moving to interest-bearing and some of that is interest-bearing being priced up. And as we think about it, we think that the peak of that catch-up will play out in third quarter as we scan the deposit types, the larger, more sophisticated clients versus the smaller clients. And that's why we expect both the catch-up to continue into the third quarter and likely peak in the third quarter and then begin to moderate in the fourth quarter and to burn down. I think it's -- I've not calculated directly on a cost versus rate basis, on a NIM basis, but I guess we could back into it if it'd be helpful to you. As we think about the long range view of NII on our book, I've given some guidance for 3Q NII, for 4Q NII. I think our instinct is that NII will settle in this $550 million to $600 million range per quarter. And if it's helpful, we can try to calculate that back into spread on assets or a spread or a cost of funds on deposits and follow up with you. Rob, it's Eric. There is a good bit of tailwind that comes from the front book, back-book. I think this on a kind of year-on-year basis, long rates were quite constructive from a year-on-year NII standpoint, the long rate tailwind year-on-year was in the $100 million basis. So it's quite substantial. On a quarter-on-quarter, the long rate tailwind is closer to $15 million, $20 million. So it's not insubstantial. And I think as we see some steepness in the curve come back or I guess I'll describe less inversion, we've got some, we've got abilities to leg into duration or curve position or, in some cases, some amount of convexity where we'd find it helpful. From a rate standpoint, like you said, average rates on the investment portfolio in aggregate was 270 basis points or so. The runoff is a good bit below that kind of in the 180 basis point range, so 90 basis points, 100 basis points south of that. And the roll-on that occurs is well above that 270 basis point average is closer to 410 basis points or more. So you've got a nice tailwind there that's playing through. We also have a tailwind on short rates for international currencies. So that's helpful. And then we are -- we continue to invest and think about opportunities across currency from a basis standpoint and so forth and we've got some latitude to do that as well given our global balance sheet. Yes. I think there's a little bit of -- I look at that data and I think you've got roughly similar movements in operational and non-operational deposits. I think what's happening in this part of the cycle is as deposits or I'll say, as cash for our clients is more valuable, right? They are selectively thinking about how much cash do I absolutely must keep in the -- in their custodial accounts. And if you think about it, they make that decision in, I think it's more than 100,000 different accounts themselves, right? It's a very large and disparate set of decisions and sub decisions by 100,000 plus fund managers and many, many fund boards. And so they're trying to see, hey, can I edge it down, and that's why at this point in the cycle, you see total deposits drift down, but also operational. What they end up needing to trade off and the reason why it will level off over time is that they need a certain amount of deposits that they don't overdraw. They -- fund managers really hate the overdraw at the end of day. And then there's also a governor where we engage with our clients on intraday and make sure that they have enough cash to cover their transactional flow and throughput, but we're just at the period where in the core custody accounts, you've got this drift downwards where they're trying to optimize without going too far and that's what you're seeing. But this is expected. We expect the operational deposits to stay comfortably in this kind of 75% range. And it's a part of the kind of custodial operations, which is what makes them so sticky, right, because they need to be there for the very significant daily, hourly and minute-by-minute transactional flows that we are processing on their behalf so that they aren't overdrawn. Sure. Yes. Let me start there, Glenn, and I think Ron will weigh in as well because a number of us have these engaging conversations with clients. I think from a burn down standpoint, let me first take it from that angle is if you think about our $200 billion of deposits, we've got deposits at a number of different price tiers and we have kind of very large sophisticated clients and then kind of that large tail of small and midsized clients. Of the $200 billion, we think there's about $50 billion that we've been very focused on and continue to be focused on. So about a quarter of our total deposits are with these clients that as we've talked about the last couple of questions, there's been a real catch-up on the back book. I described that because of that $50 billion, which is either a very low price or zero price for our larger and most sophisticated clients, where we have these engaging and balance of trade discussions, right? We've around -- we've got about $25 billion that's behind us, where largely, we've repriced those deposits. We've had those discussions and some of those have come with some balance of trade improvements or some commitments on stability on fees, and those are behind us. Included in the outlook that I provide beyond the $25 billion, there's another $15 billion that's underway right now. That's included in my third quarter outlook, right? So that gets us to $35 billion, almost $40 billion of the $50 million. And then there's a trail that we'll still have. And so I think from a client discussion and negotiation standpoint, the third quarter we expect to be the peak. I think what you'll find is that each of these questions on deposits, certainly, rates goes through a pricing committee from a balance sheet management standpoint. But very quickly, those go to the most senior client executives and all the way up to our C-suite because those are large. They're very large and that's where we engage. And I think what you'll see over time is some of that we'll come back through in FX revenues and sec lending revenues and the absence of fee rate reductions in the future, right, on one hand. And on the other hand, some of what we do here is also work with clients on expanding the range of what we do for them when it comes to managing their cash, right? I think some of the reason you're seeing the uptick in cash with in our asset management business because some of those clients say, look, I'd like to be in a cash money market sweep until we've been doing that. You see our repo business continues to do very, very well is actually an add to -- it's a stabilizer to NII or an add to NII on a year-on-year basis and stabilizing and it's a stable source of NII income quarter-on-quarter because we've been able to shift some of the client cash to those areas. So there are some offsets as well there. But that's a bit of a start. Yeah, it's Eric. It's hard to really gauge the deposit changes outright. I think we're a little more focused on the net interest, I'm sorry, the non-interest-bearing deposits where we've signaled another $5 billion likely outflow this coming quarter. That's less of an outflow than in the second quarter. So you're starting to see some of the burn down that I've described. In the external environment, I think, from the H8 reports those banks, we've seen about a 2% sequential fall in deposits. For the trust banks, we tend to have more deposits coming in when deposits in the bank system increase and we have somewhat more coming out when deposit the bank system come out and probably just the absolute sophistication of our clients. So we're -- we expect a downtick in deposits again next quarter, but just been a little more focused on the non-interest-bearing because that's where it makes a big difference. I think there is always some movement in interest-bearing deposits, especially at the higher rate tier because what we're finding increasingly as we get to a little more of this as we expect to get to a time stabilization or at least a little more of a balance with our clients. Now what they're going to do is it's hard for them to move an underlying operating deposit that actually has to cover the hundreds, thousands, in some cases, tens of thousands of transactions that are flowing through their particular account, but sometimes they'll move the thin margin deposits to a treasury. And so we might lose 10 basis points on something and they'll pick up 10 basis points on treasury. So there's some of that that's going on. And I think in truth that's not as dominant as a driver of our NII at this point. Yeah, I mean, there's -- obviously, we're like many waiting to see more from the rules. We've -- the last time we saw Basel III and game draft from either the US or international regulators was several years back. So I think we've -- we expect some higher capital requirements, just hard to tell how much. We do think there'll be effects on different parts of our businesses. So the new rules will come with an operational deposit operational capital charge. That probably will be relatively hard to influence because we actually want to build our fee-driven businesses. And so those, I think, will just come with a capital requirement that's -- that will be an add. There'll be some reduction on the lending book, so that will be helpful. And then I think in particular, while the fundamental review of the trading book will affect the universal banks potentially in a negative way. For us, the sec finance business will tend to be a positive, will be in a positive territory where capital requirements will be less. We'll no longer need to hold capital to indemnify treasury. So they'll finally become economically more rational in the safer areas, right, as they should be. They should obviously -- capital needs to be held for the riskier activities. But we don't traffic in the riskier areas. And I think that, in some ways, that will give us an opportunity to grow those areas that are quite aligned with our client base like sec finance and actually deploy capital more actively. And so I think there'll be a mix of impacts, we're going to see as it comes through, but I like many were -- we're considering what's to come and we'll react accordingly as it does. And just to round that out, we've got to pay for performance. So when we have larger -- we deliver larger sales, we'll pay for that when it's a little lighter. As you saw, we'll reign that in, and that's part of the execution mines that we have. We've also just given some of the evolution on salary increases and that we've all worked through over the last couple of quarters over the last year. We also feel like it's time where we have enough staff and so we've put in place a hiring freeze because we need to contain our staffing costs. So we need to make sure as we reengineer, we actually redeploy our folks to, say, new business areas or to growth areas and actually pair down others. And the way to do that in a more emphatic way tactically, right, is to be particularly disciplined on hiring, and freeze that or just limit it. And so given the short-term performance, we're doing that as well, which gives you a sense for our willingness to bend the cost curve."

O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our financial highlights, I would like to briefly reflect on the eventful operating environment in the first quarter. Investors had to contend with significant market movements and volatility, driven by persistent inflation, continued central bank interest rate increases, and the recent disruption to certain segments of the banking industry. First quarter global financial market performance was choppy. January produced a very strong start to the year with gains across most asset classes, including equities recording the strongest start to a year since 2019. However, investors remained cautious about the prospect of enduring inflation and a potential recession in the United States. February saw that encouraging start recede as strong U.S. employment data led to growing concerns about the persistence of inflation, which in turn saw market expectations for central bank rate hikes increase, fixed income and equity markets declined, and the U.S. dollar strengthen. March saw a continued rise in central bank rates, which in turn drove shocks to both the U.S. regional and international banking sectors and the need to resolve a number of banks. All this drove negative market sentiment, contributing to large inflows into money market funds and a reversal of a number of the macro trends from the prior month. Both current interest rates and rate expectations decreased and the U.S. dollar weakened, although relative calm returned to markets by the end of the quarter. Notwithstanding these events, all told, global financial markets performed relatively well in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year with broad-based gains recorded across global equities, while U.S. treasuries experienced their best quarter since the first quarter of 2020. However, daily average equity and bond market levels both remained significantly below year-ago period with average equity markets down approximately 10%, which created headwinds for our fee-driven businesses impacting our year-over-year financial results, which I will discuss shortly. Before I discuss our financial highlights, I would like to briefly comment on the recent events in parts of the banking sector. As the globally systemically important financial institution, State Street plays a critical role in the world's financial system. Our strong capital and liquidity positions, size, scale, and sophisticated risk management allow us to help safeguard investors and assist in providing market stability during uncertain times. We demonstrated this ability at the start of COVID three years ago when we helped establish the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility and the Main Street Lending Program. During the first quarter, in concert with 10 other large U.S. banks, State Street once again used its financial strength to help assist in stabilizing the financial system through the provision of liquidity to a financial institution in the U.S., reflecting our confidence in the American banking system. We stand ready to support the world's investors and the people they serve during this time of uncertainty through our investment servicing and asset management products, which offer clients opportunities, insights, and liquidity. Turning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation, I will review our first quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Relative to the year-ago period, first quarter EPS was $1.52, down 3% as the positive year-over-year benefit resulting from our continued common share repurchases as well as significantly stronger NII growth were offset by lower servicing and management fee revenues, which were impacted by weaker average market levels, continued business and personnel investments to support growth, and a loan loss provision related to State Street support of the U.S. banking system, which I just mentioned. Turning to our business momentum, we remain highly focused on continuing to advance our enterprise outsourced solutions strategy across our clients' front, middle, and back-office activities. For example, in March, we announced our agreement to acquire CF Global Trading. This transaction will further expand State Street's current outsourced trading capabilities, giving our firm the ability to provide these services to new clients and markets. Importantly, the acquisition will allow State Street to expand its liquidity providing capabilities and offer a complete global trading solution as part of our Alpha front-to-back platform. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. AUC/A amounted to $37.6 trillion at quarter-end and we recorded asset servicing wins of $112 billion in the first quarter, about half of which were higher fee rate alternative mandates, consistent with our strategy. Encouragingly, this was our second best quarterly sales performance by projected revenue within the alternative segments over the last six years. We also reported an additional Alpha mandate during the first quarter as this strategy continues to resonate with clients. Our AUC/A installation backlog amounted to $3.6 trillion at quarter-end. At State Street Global Advisors, quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.6 trillion, while flows across our asset management businesses were negatively impacted by the various market factors in the first quarter. We continue to see a number of bright spots where we are focusing our efforts. For example, in the U.S., our SPDR ETF franchise gained market share in both low-cost equity and low-cost fixed income, while we also had strong inflows into our gold ETFs amidst investor demand for safe haven assets. While aggregate flows to cash were slightly negative for the quarter, this largely resulted from seasonal outflow activity in January. However, Global Advisors gathered strong money market inflows of over $24 billion in the latter part of March amidst the market volatility. Turning to our financial condition, State Street's balance sheet, liquidity, and capital position remained strong. Our CET1 ratio was a high 12.1% at quarter-end, well above State Street's regulatory minimum. This balance sheet strength enabled us to continue to return capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, while simultaneously supporting our clients and the U.S. banking system. We returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in Q1, including buying back $1.25 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. As we look ahead in this uncertain environment, we remain highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet position, while continuing to generate and return capital as part of our previously announced common stock repurchase program of up to $4.5 billion for 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, the first quarter included a number of significant events in global financial markets and with the global -- with the broader banking industry. While market conditions were volatile, many asset classes saw sequential quarter gains, although asset prices remained depressed relative to the year ago period, which created year-over-year headwinds for our fee-driven businesses in the first quarter. While our year-over-year revenue performance was durable, supported by significantly higher net interest income growth, our results this quarter were below our expectations. We need to do better, and I believe we are equipped and on track to do so by focusing on areas within our control and effectively executing our strategy. In keeping with the strategic priorities I outlined in January, we are driving forward with a number of actions. For example, our AUC/A to be installed is strong, and by strengthening our implementation capabilities, we have line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding beginning in 2Q. Within our software and data business, we expect to convert a meaningful number of CRD on-premises clients to more recurring SaaS revenue in the second quarter. Last, given the revenue inflationary environments, we will continue to selectively reprice some services, proactively manage our cost, execute on our productivity efforts, and stand ready to utilize additional expense levers at our disposal. With the focus on accountability and execution of our strategy, I continue to firmly believe in the ability of our diversified franchise to successfully meet the needs of the world's investors and the people they serve, while delivering value for and capital to -- capital return to our shareholders. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on Slide 4. We reported earnings per share of $1.52 for the quarter, which included a $20 million -- a $29 million provision or $0.06 of EPS impact associated with the expansion of liquidity for U.S. financial institution, as we participated in an industry consortium supporting the banking system. We were pleased to do our part. On the left panel of the slide, you can see that our first quarter '23 results reflected the year-on-year decline in both equity and fixed income markets, but was more than offset by strength in net interest income and strong momentum in our securities finance business. EPS was down just 3% as another quarter of significant buybacks reduced the number of shares outstanding. Against this challenging backdrop, we again held total expense growth to just 2% year-on-year, even as we continued to thoughtfully invest in product and client growth initiatives. Turning now to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw period end AUC/A decrease by 10% on a year-on-year basis, but increased 2% sequentially. Year-on-year, the decrease of AUC/A was largely driven by lower period end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally, which were both down in the 10% range. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of higher period end market levels and client flows. At Global Advisors, we saw similar dynamics play out. Overall, our first quarter AUM was negatively impacted by volatile markets. Period end AUM decreased 10% year-on-year, but increased 4% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels and net outflows. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels, partially offset by some outflows. Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees down 11% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average market levels, client activity and adjustments, and normal pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down 10% year-on-year. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 1%, primarily as a result of higher average equity market levels, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments. On the bottom panel of this page, we've included some sales performance indicators, which highlight the good business momentum we again saw in the quarter. AUC/A wins in the first quarter totaled $112 billion with about half driven by wins across the growing Alternatives segment, especially in private markets. The fee rate on these alternative wins are generally more than 4 times the total servicing fee average, which makes this a strong win quarter from a projected revenue standpoint. At quarter end, AUC/A won, but yet to be installed totaled $3.6 trillion with Alpha representing a healthy portion, which, again, reflects the unique value proposition of our strategy. Given the planning and preparation since these deals were announced, we expect significant onboardings of this uninstalled AUC/A next quarter. Turning to Slide 7. First quarter management fees were $457 million, down 12% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average market levels and a previously reported client specific pricing adjustment. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were flat as higher market levels were partially offset by outflows and day count. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, notwithstanding the difficult macroeconomic backdrop in the quarter, our franchise remains well positioned, as evidenced by our continued strong business momentum. In ETFs, we continued to build on strategic growth segments, which is reflected in net flows in our SPDR portfolio low cost equity and fixed income suites. In our institutional business, we saw net outflows while sustaining continued momentum in defined contribution with the Target Date franchise recording inflows of $6 billion. Across our cash franchise, consistent with industry trends late in the first quarter, we saw a flight to quality with significant net inflows worth 7% of cash AUM into SSGA money market funds since the week ending March 10th, which largely reversed the seasonal outflows experienced earlier in the quarter. Turning now to Slide 8. Relative to the period a year ago, first quarter FX trading services revenue was down 5%, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes partially offset by higher spreads. As a reminder, the start of the war in Europe last year caused some unusually high FX trading activity in 1Q '22. Sequentially, FX trading services revenue ex-notables was down 1% with lower spreads offset by 6% higher client volumes. And consistent with the significant increases into industry wide money market flows, our GlobalLink franchise experienced an increase of $20 billion or 13% into its money market cash sweep program during the last three weeks of March. Securities finance performed well in the first quarter with revenues up 14% year-on-year, driven by higher specials activity and an active focus on business returns, partially offset by lower balances, which was consistent with the industry. Sequentially, revenues were up 6%, again mainly driven by higher specials activity, which was consistent with the market and securities lending industry environment. Moving onto software and processing fees. First quarter software and processing fees were down 18% year-on-year and 24% sequentially, primarily driven by lumpy on-premise renewals in the front-office software revenues, which I'll turn to shortly. Lending fees for the quarter were down both year-on-year and sequentially, primarily due to a shift away from products with higher fees, but lower returns. Finally, other fee revenue increased $16 million year-on-year, primarily due to positive market-related adjustments and $27 million sequentially, largely due to fair value adjustments on equity investments. Moving to Slide 9. You'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue declined year-on-year, primarily as a result of lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by continued growth in software enabled revenue. Timing of installations will vary quarter-on-quarter based on the size and scope of prior business wins and we expect several SaaS conversions and several on-premise renewals to come through in the second quarter. Year-on-year, our annualized recurring revenue was 16%. Our software enabled revenue was up 11% year-on-year, but down sequentially due to the absence of an accounting true-up in fourth quarter. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics on the right panel. We were pleased to report another Alpha mandate win in the asset owner client segment. In addition to the reported win this quarter, we expect significant middle-office installations in 2Q as we've completed the preparations to begin to onboard a portion of a large mandate won back in 2021. Turning to Slide 10. First quarter NII increased 50% year-on-year, but declined 3% sequentially to $766 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-term rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower deposits. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by additional client rotation out of non-interest bearing deposit balances, partially offset by higher short term market rates from central bank hikes. On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the first quarter. Year-on-year average assets declined 6% and 2% sequentially. Average deposits declined 3% quarter-on-quarter, which is relatively consistent with our expectation for first quarter seasonality and client pricing preferences during periods of rising rates. Of note, average weekly deposit levels at quarter end increased 5% as we compare with week -- with the week ended March 10. The stress in the regional bank space primarily affected consumer and corporate depositors rather than the institutional asset manager and asset owners that we serve. We, in contrast, saw some risk off deposit inflows at the end of the quarter. Our operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remain consistent at 75%. These are determined by regulatory guidance. U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 80% to 90% during the quarter, as expected. Foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower, in the 30% to 45% range, depending on currency. Our international footprint continues to be an advantage. Turning to Slide 11. Our first quarter expenses excluding notable items increased just 2% year-on-year or up approximately 4% adjusted for currency translation. In the light of the current revenue environment, we're actively managing expenses, while continuing to carefully invest in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations automation. Compensation and employee benefits increased 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher salary increases associated with the wage inflation and higher headcount attributable to lower attrition rates and in-sourcing. Total non-compensation expenses, on the other hand, decreased 1% year-on-year as continued productivity and optimization savings more than offset increases in certain variable costs and professional services. On a line-by-line basis for non-compensation expenses, information systems and communications expenses were down 2% due to benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was down 9%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs from declining market levels as well as lower broker fees. And other expenses were up 9%, mainly reflecting the higher professional fees, travel, and marketing costs. Moving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with extremely strong capital levels, which are well above our targets, let alone the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio was up slightly year-on-year, but down 1.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 12.1%, which was largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program and the expected normalization of RWAs that we discussed last quarter. Tier 1 leverage ratio was flattish at 5.9%. Our LCR for State Street Corporation increased a couple of percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 108% and 4 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 124% for State Street Bank and Trust where most of our businesses transacted. We were quite pleased to return $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, consisting of $1.25 billion of common share repurchases and $212 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, given the high level of capital across every measure, positive pull-to-par in AOCI and our strong earnings trajectory, we continue to expect to return up to $4.5 billion of capital in the form of buybacks at pace this year, subject to market conditions of course. Turning to Slide 13, which provides a summary of our first quarter results. While there is certainly still work to do, we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a very challenging backdrop and the continued competitive strength of our global franchise. Next, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter. At a macro level, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggest the Fed, ECB and Bank of England, all continue to hike to varying degrees in 2Q. In terms of markets, we currently expect average U.S. equity and global bond markets to be up about 1% to 2% quarter-on-quarter and international equity markets to be flattish. Regarding fee revenue in 2Q and on a sequential quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 4% to 5% with servicing fees up 1% to 2% and management fees approximately flat to up 1%. We expect to see a significant increase in front office software and data revenues as we have line of sight to a number of on-premise renewals and SaaS conversions in 2Q. In our other fee revenue line, which we know is difficult to forecast, we intend to adopt in 2Q the new accounting guidance recently issued regarding renewable energy investments. We would expect to see a sequential quarter uptick in total other revenues of between $5 million to $15 million, but this estimate always depends on market levels. As we adopt this accounting change, our effective tax rate for 2Q '23 is expected to be approximately 21%. The adoption will be roughly neutral to EPS. Regarding NII, we now expect NII in the second quarter to decrease 5% to 10% sequentially, primarily driven by the non-interest bearing deposit rotation and interest-bearing deposit betas as quantitative tightening and rate hikes continue into 2Q. Turning to expenses. We remain focused on driving productivity and controlling costs in this environment. We expect that second quarter expenses will be flat on a sequential quarter basis, excluding the 1Q seasonal compensation cost of $181 million. Overall, we will offset some of the 2Q NII trends with higher fee revenues as business momentum builds in 2Q and through the year and we continue to actively manage expenses. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the NII side of things. So Eric, maybe you can just kind of walk through how much of that 5% to 10% in the second quarter is simply the averaging effect? And also just -- you made a point in your release about how dollar type (ph) increased since the early March going to the end. What we think about in terms of your expectations for deposit growth both on an end-of-period and average basis going forward as well? Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, Ken. It's Eric. The largest driver of our NII trends right now, whether it's the fourth quarter to the first quarter or first quarter to second quarter is really the level of non-interest-bearing deposits. Those came down this past quarter about $5 billion. We had expected them to come down about $3.5 billion. And we do a fair amount of forecasting on this. We think about January, February. March, it usually comes through in a U shape and we actually had a -- had some of the opposite play through in March. And so that's what's been driving some of the change in NII. And in contrast, we've actually seen good flows in interest-bearing deposits at the same time. So there is a fair amount going on under the surface. As we look into second quarter, we expect this pace of non-interest-bearing deposits to continue to rotate. So if you step back, last year, we had periods where non-interest-bearing deposits were up $1 billion; then down $2 billion; then down $4 billion; then down $2 billion, right? It's been quite volatile. And right now we're expecting non-interest-bearing deposits probably to come down another $4 billion, $5 billion into the second quarter. And if you think about it, when you earn 5% or more for those kinds of deposits on the asset side and then pay zero, that can be a significant -- that's a significant amount of NII, right? Every $1 billion is worth $12 million, sometimes $15 million per quarter. And so that's what we are seeing flowing through. The hard work we're trying to do from a forecasting standpoint, and forecasting is always hard, is where does the trend -- how does that trend play out and we do some of what you probably do, which is we've looked at the last peak and the last low of non-interest-bearing deposits. The peak was 22%; the last low was 18%. On the other hand, in dollar terms, the last peak was $50 billion, and the last low was about $30 billion, and right now, we're sitting at about $39 billion. And so that's what's really playing through the NII forecast. And then as we play that out, we expect to see some of that non-interest-bearing deposit rotate into interest-bearing deposits, but to be honest, some of our clients who are sophisticated institutions are also looking at some of the other strong rates that they can get either in treasuries or money market funds. And so, at this point in the cycle, with the high level of prevailing rates, we expect deposits probably to trend down another few billion into the second quarter, but this is all kind of dependent on client behavior and activity as we take a look at our forecast.\nKenneth Usdin: Yeah. Thanks, Eric. And just one follow-up to that is just that -- the types of changes in client activity, is this a different behavior than you've seen in the past in terms of where the ins and outs are coming from? I mean, obviously, we were all expecting deposits to come down, as were you, and then the events of the last month came through. So are clients just making different decisions with what they're doing with their even operational cash? Or how would you kind of describe what's happening across the client base? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. I think clients are -- the clients (ph) are making a variety of different decisions here. And I think part of what - why we're seeing, what we're seeing is that we've not lived in an environment where interest rates are at 5%, whether you put that at the Fed or in three and six-month treasuries, right? And so clients have a fair amount of alternatives and they're thinking about how to deploy, how to maximize interest and yields for their own clients, especially the kind of clients we have who are -- over time will always be price-sensitive. When it comes to the operational nature of the deposits, you can see from our disclosure and we added some of this, clients are incredibly sticky and stable from an operational standpoint. Operational deposit balances were steady and the operational percentages continue to be very -- in a very narrow band. You have clients with several billions of dollars each often, but they typically have hundreds, if not thousands of individual accounts with very significant transactional and payment flows, and that's why they're categorized as operational in nature. And so that behavior hasn't changed. What we -- that behavior of core custodial deposits is deeply ingrained in the structure of those accounts, the processing we do for them, the avoidance of overdrafts that they always try to -- that they don't want to -- that they don't want. I think what we're seeing instead is clients on the margin will find, for their discretionary, the last dollar of $100 of deposits, they're going to be rate-seeking. And at these prevailing rates, there is -- they're going to look here and there. Now sometimes, we match them with those rates. So we'll offer deposits at exception rates. Sometimes we help them with their sweeps or some of their treasury repo interest. And so there is a variety of different ways we serve our clients and we'll continue to do that. But clearly, at this point in the rate cycle, you kind of have some of the patterns that you and we would expect to have.\nKenneth Usdin: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color, Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good morning. This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just a quick follow-up on NII, and in particular, the geographic mix of deposits. So you've got kind of fairly steady trends, U.S. kind of going up and a higher beta, as you've called out in the past, and then non-U.S. somewhat going down with a lower beta. Just wondering if you expect based on what you're seeing right now with your clients, those trends to continue. In particular, will we continue to see pressure on non-U.S. deposit balances? And could those betas maybe be going up outside the U.S. as you say, the competing yields are somewhat higher? Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Thanks for the question. I think we'll continue to see a range of behaviors across the geographies. I mean, I think the way I would describe them is in the U.S., with prevailing rates at where they are, you have this non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing rotation on one hand. And then you have clients nudging on pricing in general. And we're kind of at that point where clients now have incentives, just like we do, to find a place to settle at with us. I think in Europe and pound sterling, it's still new, right? We've just been at the kind of the first, maybe half, two-thirds of the rate increases. And there, the betas continue to be in that 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% range and are quite attractive for us. They're good for clients because the clients tend to have somewhat fewer alternatives in those international jurisdictions relative to the U.S. on one hand. On the other, there tends to be a more -- there tends to be less price sensitivity on the deposits. And we do expect that to continue. And I think with more rate increases flowing through in the international jurisdictions, that allow us to continue to lag modestly the deposit rates that we offer to see those play through.\nAdam Beatty: Great. That makes sense. Thanks, Eric. And then just turning to the buyback, pretty healthy in the quarter. You still got the kind of not-to-exceed target out there. So just wondering how you're thinking about that in terms of deposit trends and capital needs and whether some of the disruption in the banking backdrop has maybe affected your thinking around the buyback. Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. Good question, and it's something that we've been very deliberate and thoughtful about. You can imagine, as we saw the events in March unfold, we've been thinking daily and weekly about how stable is the broader banking system. The starting point for us is we've got an incredibly strong balance sheet, right? Our capital ratios are in the 12% range. That's 100 basis points above the top end of our range, 200 basis points higher than the bottom of our range. It's 400 basis points above the regulatory requirements. And you know many run much thinner in terms of regulatory requirements. And we've always chosen to run with this kind of -- with a healthy buffer. So I think on one hand, the starting point for us is important in our ongoing decisioning around capital return, and we're conscious of that. On the other hand, just like you say, we assess the market conditions and the environment, not for us, because this is not about us. This is about what's happened in some of the other parts of the banking system. We assess those. And if we would had economic and banking conditions like they were at the beginning of March, I think we'd have a -- we'd make different statements around our capital buyback. And so we feel like there has been a fair amount of healing since the beginning, middle of March, and we think that gives us -- that factors into our thinking. And then what we'll do is we'll continue to evaluate conditions, right, if market conditions and systemic conditions get more concerning for the system, we'll -- we may pace these differently if they continue to be at these levels of stability that we're at, we feel confident that, that we can and should continue to proceed. But it will be a week-by-week reassessment. Our buybacks aren't once and done. They're done over the course of the next eight to 10 weeks. And this is one of those quarters where you do them more linearly than not. And so we'll evaluate. But our position of strength is just quite -- I think quite high and gives us a fair amount of latitude.\nAdam Beatty: Great. Good context. Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Could we talk a little bit about the expense outlook and how you're thinking about managing it? I know that you mentioned 2Q specifically, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you are thinking about operating leverage either on a total rev basis or more on a fee basis. Really what I'm trying to get at is how you think about the NII piece as we think about operating leverage for the 2Q and for the full year. Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Betsy, there is a couple of different ways we look at this. And clearly, we're one quarter into the year. We've started to give some outlook for second quarter, and we need to see how the conditions and the environment plays out because equity markets up or down, bond markets up or down by more than a percentage point or 2 is going to impact our revenues. And so I think it's still early in the year. We set out this year to drive positive operating leverage and continue to look for ways to do that, but we need more information about the external conditions to really see that. I think as we think about the opportunities here though, NII will trend positively for the year, but not as positively as we would have expected. So that's a consideration. You saw that we took up our fee guide for the second quarter, and so that gives us a little more ballast or breathing room or momentum, to be honest. And we'll continue to manage expenses quite actively. I would say in the last year and a half, as NII was up 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, right, we didn't spend that on the expense line, right? We were quite conscious of continuing to drive investment, but also productivity and calibrate it in our expense growth. And so as we look forward, we'll continue to do that, but obviously, with a -- we'll keep track of the direction of revenues and obviously try to adapt where we can.\nBetsy Graseck: And then just a quick follow-up on the other fee line that you discussed, the $5 million to $50 million increased Q2. Could you just give us a sense of how we should think about the trajectory of that? Are you going to be increasing your investment into renewables and so that should be a growing line in line with increase in investments to renewables? Or is that a one-time step-up in that? So just a little color there. Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. It's -- the revenue impact on that line is a little bit of both, and we're still discerning all the specifics in doing the forecasting. In second quarter, we have -- we need to do a year-to-date catch-up. That's how the accounting guidance is written. And then there will be some additional revenues in the third and fourth quarter, not as much as there would be from the second quarter catch-up. So we're trying to map that out. And as the quarter proceeds, we'll try to get a little more guidance out. But that line will tend to have -- instead of kind of being centered around zero, will be centered around a slightly higher number in the coming quarters, and we'll try to get some guidance out on that as we go through all the forecasts.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, gentlemen. Eric, can you share with us how you guys are investing your cash in your securities portfolio in terms of durations that you're looking at? Are you trying to shorten the duration of the portfolio as you reinvest the cash proceeds that come off with every quarter? What's your thinking about that?\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, it's Eric. We're -- we've been quite careful over the years of running a portfolio with a modest amount of duration. I think it's typically in the two and a half to 2.8 years in that -- that provides us some amount of benefit from what historically has been steepness in the yield curve. It's also given us some ability to create some amount of stabilization in NII without forsaking the opportunity to benefit from interest rate rises, which is what we've been able to do over the last two years. We like that amount of duration because it also protects the income statement as rates fall, and we'll see if that -- if there is -- if there are rate cuts late in the year or next year or the year after that. So that gives us some stability as well. I think what I'd tell you though is, we spend as much time on duration curve shape as we do on carefully also running some MBS portfolios where there is some additional yield pickup, but you've got to be careful in terms of the level of convexity risk that you take. And then because of our deposit franchise, as was mentioned earlier, we're doing this around the globe. We've got about a third of our balance sheets in international jurisdictions, and that gives us real opportunities in pound sterling, euro, Canadian, Aussie dollars et cetera to invest. And we may run somewhat different duration levels in those different currencies. We might be shorter in one, longer in other, partly to reflect our views on the rate cycle and where each of those are. So there is a range of kind of approaches that we take there, and we find that our flexibility gives us some opportunities to deliver some good yields in NII, but obviously being careful. We don't want to stretch for duration. We don't want to stretch for yield. We want to continue to run a conservative portfolio like we have for many, many years.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then just a follow-up on your comments about deposits. I think you said that the low point of non-interest bearing were at $30 billion; you're sitting at $39 billion now. And two-part question, where do you -- if rates just stay here, let's say, the Fed doesn't start cutting rates later this year and next year and we get a 4.75%, 5% Fed funds rate, do you sense that the non-interest-bearing deposits could approach that $30 billion on a go-forward basis? And second, on your operational accounts, do you guys have to pay any interest on those accounts?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. Let me do that in reverse order. The operational accounts are sometimes interest-bearing, sometimes non-interest-bearing. So there is a wide variety of different pricing structures, but they tend to be -- remember -- and these are thousands of accounts oftentimes for each of our -- for each of the asset managers or asset owners that we custody for. And it's less about the pricing in those accounts than about the nature of the accounts and the payment transactions that clients are funding in effect with the deposits that they leave with us. In terms of non-interest-bearing deposits, I do think we'll continue to see a trend downwards. We saw a $5 billion trend this past quarter, which was $1 billion or $2 billion more than we had expected even back at that early -- even back when we last gave guidance. We expect probably another $4 billion, $5 billion will come out in the second quarter. And then I think we do believe that there is going to begin to be some stabilization. I'd be inclined to think that we'll get to that $30 billion probably later this year, but this is where there is no amount of crystal-balling that we can provide. It's hard to really be sure it could be at that level, it could be around that level. There is -- we've seen movements in non-interest-bearing month by month that are plus/minus $4 billion or $5 billion. Even in April, as an example, we've had days where non-interest bearings were in the $44 billion level, so $5 billion above the recent average and days when they were at the $34 billion level. So it's that kind of range and volatility that we're trying to forecast through, but clearly, the trend's here, and I think the last benchmark of that -- around that $30 billion level may be one that we approach potentially later this year.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Appreciate the insight. Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Okay. Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nJames Mitchell: Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the fee income story. You talked about a pretty hefty sequential growth, but not necessarily coming from the servicing line, so -- but you talked about great momentum in servicing and onboarding. So how do we think about the trajectory on the servicing fee line as you onboard? Is it more of a back half story and how are you thinking about full year with servicing fees?\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Yeah, Jim. It's Ron. So maybe I'll start here. On servicing fees, we -- as Eric noted, we do expect growth, and it's driven by a couple of things. One is, we've been carrying for a while now a fair amount of AUC/A to be implemented. A lot of that was tied to some systems development that needed to occur that is occurring. So we're expecting to see a hefty amount of that AUC/A to get installed. Secondly, the wins this quarter were -- while it was a low AUC/A amount, it was much more traditional back office plus this very large alternatives, both of which are easier to install, but they take less time to install. So we're actually quite pleased with how 2023 is shaping up from a sales perspective and it's good that it's shaping up early in the year. So with all that, we do expect to have a meaningful amount of servicing fee growth. That coupled with -- depending on what you believe about markets, tends to wash over everything that I'm talking about, but if you believe that there's some kind of market stability, we feel pretty good about the year as we look forward.\nEric Aboaf: And Jim, it's Eric. Just to round that out, Ron's covered servicing fees. Management fees should give us some lift as well as we have some equity market appreciation -- equity and bond market appreciation into the second quarter. I think if you go through the trading lines, second quarter is usually good. We'll have to see just how much volumes play through in spread, so -- but you've seen we've been making nice headway given the market volatility with specials and sec finance that will likely continue. In the software and processing line, we had one of the lowest on-premise renewal quarters this -- in 1Q. And that one just varies. If you just you look at some of the materials in the deck, that could be $6 million, it could be $60 million. That was literally the swing from fourth quarter to first quarter. We expect, as we had said, some sizable upticks there as well. So there is a range of areas. And in effect, from a management standpoint, we're focused on every one of the opportunities and businesses and harnessing the client momentum that we've been seeing.\nJames Mitchell: No. Yeah. Sure, Eric. I appreciate all that. But in terms of the sequential increase of 4% to 5%, it seems like a lot of it's coming from some of these lumpy revenue streams that don't necessarily continue further out whether it's other kind of catch-up, whether it's software processes jumping back. But when we think about sort of the momentum in the back half, can that sort of new run rate in the second quarter -- is that sustainable as you gain momentum in some of the more annuity-like revenue streams or do we kind of have to push it out a little longer? I'm just trying to get a sense of beyond 2Q, you have a nice jump in 2Q, but is that really sustainable?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. No, I understand the perspective. I think what I will remind you on software and processing, we had an unusually low print in the first quarter. So the first part of the follow up (ph) in second quarter is rebound and then continuation. On-premise revenues have averaged about $30 million a quarter, for example. That's a reasonable kind of average that one could expect, but we printed $6 million this past quarter. So it's that kind of, I think, rebound we're expecting in the second quarter and then it should stay within the averages. And then beyond that, to your point, there are the more annuity-like areas, whether it's the software enabled, the SaaS revenues in software, whether it's some of the -- we have very flow-oriented FX and securities finance books. And then as Ron mentioned, we're seeing increasing momentum in servicing fees and management fees, and the servicing fee momentum is spread as we've mentioned, both in terms of back office and in middle office, which gives us additional diversity. It's hard for us to predict the second half of the year, and I'll hesitate every April to re-estimate the full year, but I think we'll know more as we get to June and July, and I'll certainly give -- be able to give you an indication. But we've -- we're certainly seeing momentum of activity with clients and expect some of these onboardings to come through. And we think that provides a step-up and then there should be some continuation beyond second quarter that will be positive.\nJames Mitchell: All right. Well, thanks for all the color.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSharon Leung: Hey. Good morning. This is actually Sharon Leung on for Steven. For NII, I know you noted that you -- it will still be up, but maybe not as meaningfully as the 20% you had guided to previously. Is there any numbers you can put around that, for example, assuming that the NIB rotation continues as expected and you get to that $30 billion number sometime in the year?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. I mean, the -- this is where the forecasts just have a wide range of outcomes. I think given the first quarter report and what we expect in the second quarter, we don't think that one can reach that -- at up 20% for the full year. I think what we're wrestling with is just what's the pace of rotation and what's the pace of some of the price sensitivity that we see in the U.S. clients at this point in the cycle. And that's what's harder to determine. So there is a range of forecasts we have. And if I had to kind of share with you, I'd say if one thinks of it in a more dour way and expects more rotation and more price sensitivity, NII could be up 5% to 10% this year instead of 20%. On the other hand, if one's optimistic and believes some of the history, where there is real attenuation in the non-interest-bearing deposits, NII could be up 10% to 15%. So there is a larger range than usual in the forecast that we have. And to be honest, just like I quoted some of the April year-to-date data and the range of levels that we're seeing, we expect that those -- we expect to be -- that there will be quite a bit of range in the outcomes, just really hard to predict. But maybe that gives you some perspective. It's probably a larger range than you're looking for, but we're trying to be as transparent and forthcoming as we can given the facts and the information that we have here.\nSharon Leung: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess just a couple of quick follow-ups, Eric. One on NII. I heard all your comments on the -- in the Q&A. Just trying to make sense of, is the customer behavior that surprised you today versus January given that you probably assumed that rates were going a little bit higher than where we were back in Jan, or is it the events of the last month that have changed customer behavior and increased the intensity of repricing?\nEric Aboaf: No, I don't think it's really the events of the last month, which are really in very different client segments, different geographies. Those are very different from what we do and who we serve. And we had a little bit of a flight to quality -- not flight to quality; we had a bit of this risk-off sentiment with deposits, but that's just a whole different ecosystem than those clients that we serve. I think what's really happening here and what we've been trying to estimate, but maybe is unestimatable or unforecastable is just how do clients operate when prevailing rates are at 5% in the United States, right? We've not had that scenario in our -- for some of us in our careers, right? But for some of us, going back many, many -- probably two decades. And so the data is thin on that question. And I think what we've seen is back in January, when we had given some of our NII guidance for the quarter, just on non-interest-bearing deposits, we had seen one quarter where they were up a little bit, one quarter where they were down $5 billion. And then the third to fourth quarter, they were down $2 billion, right? So you're in this situation where you're trying to guess, forecast, estimate we can -- we've got to use all those words. And I think we thought we might have reached some attenuation, but we didn't. There was another step of rotation playing through. It's not a rational for clients to do that, and so they've shifted. Now they shift from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing. They shift across currency sometimes because of their sophistication. I think what's interesting is that we actually got more deposits in the U.S. and we had some outflows in -- or some net reductions in Europe and in Asia. And so you kind of have a real mix out there. And I think what we're realizing is all the data sets we have are actually not -- there is not enough data on this question of deposit or, I'll call it, deposit or pricing behavior because that's what this is about. And that's what we're trying to better estimate. But the clients we're serving, we're continuing to serve, the momentum in the business is clear. And just like NII went up faster than we had thought, I think there is a trend here that it's coming down a bit sequentially. It's still going to be up for the full year, but we'll need to see how much.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just a separate question. I know it's small for you, but the other element that your provision is higher, the credit portfolio rating, remind us of the credit sensitivity that we should expect from the balance sheet from an economic downturn, if there are more rating agency downgrades, like what that means from a credit cost provisioning perspective as we look forward.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. It's good question. I mean, the -- aside from the provision that's calculated using all the CECL techniques and fairly regimented that we had for that -- for the one cash placement that we made, the provision was about $15 million. I think for us, provisions have been in the $5 million, $10 million, $15 million range typically. We've seen a little bit of migration or change in ratings in a half dozen credits, but it's the kind of thing that plays through. And part of that is we have higher prevailing rates, and that puts a little bit of pressure in different parts of the economy and I think it's probably fairly typical. I think the -- we run quite a high-quality and high grade lending book. Even where we're a little more down market, we call BBs down market, right? So we have a ratings distributions that are typically in the A or A- or even better range. So we'll have some sensitivity to economic conditions. You can go back to around the start of COVID, right? A number of banks built reserves, that can give you a sense of sensitivity. But what we feel like we're well reserved now given what we know, both on the economic conditions and individual positions that we hold. It's highly diversified. It's high quality. And we'll obviously -- we'll continue to monitor, but feel like it's reasonably stable with a little bit of drift down situation just given the direction of rates in the economy.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Mayo: Hi. As you know, the markets that’s a little generations (ph) Silicon Valley. And can you just make it crystal clear? I mean, I think I know the answer, but I need you to really explain why this is an earnings issue and not a liquidity issue. And on the earnings issue, just to make sure I heard you correctly, your non-interest-bearing deposits went from $44 billion down to $39 billion. You think base case, it might go down to $34 billion, but the low end of the range, which is possible later this year would be $30 billion. That would be going maybe non-interest-bearing deposits from $44 billion down to $30 billion, that would be $14 billion less than free money. You said it was $12 million to $15 million per $1 billion. So just taking the worst case, you go down to the $30 billion, it hurts you $15 million, we're talking about $200 million of earnings lost which might be around 7% or 8% of your EPS, if you look at kind of a run rate sort of thing. So first, is my math correct there that that is the earnings issue? And then reassure if it's appropriate, that this is not a liquidity issue.\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Mike, why don't I start? I think that as you're calculating the worst case, I think your math roughly is correct. We're doing all we can to avoid the worst case, but I think your math and how you get to the earnings impact is right, assuming the -- in effect, 100% margin on the deposits. In terms of liquidity, there is nothing here that approaches a liquidity issue, right? These are custody deposits. As Eric noted, they're operating deposits. They give you a sense and a little more explanation of why we've got X number of clients, but a multiple number of accounts. And if you think about it, a mutual fund company probably has at least one account per fund they have with us, if not more. It's to actually run their funds. If you look at the liquidity coverage ratio, which Eric walked you through, it's up at 124% now. It's actually gone up, not down. So yes, this is an earnings issue and one that we intend to offset to the extent possible with the primary source of our revenue, which is fees as well as continued careful management of expenses.\nMichael Mayo: And then a follow-up to that. You said you're not changing your buyback. So you have $4.5 billion for the year. You've done $1.25 billion. So you have $3.25 billion left. With the current market decline, that would be 14% of your market cap. So to the extent you see this as a step down, but not life-threatening, what's your appetite toward completing that buyback and how soon are you able to enter the market?\nRonald P. O'Hanley: I mean -- Mike, I think Eric explained it well. If you look at our capital levels, and the fact that we held off buying back shares for quite a large amount of -- basically for most of last year, we feel comfortable continuing the buyback. We're obviously conscious of the environment. So we feel comfortable doing that, and we certainly feel comfortable about ourselves, but there is the system in which we live, and to the extent to which the system started to look very different from what it is today, look a whole lot more like or even worse than what we saw in March, we're certainly not going to ignore that. But our -- based on what we know now and our financial strength, we think it's actually quite prudent to do so. And our forecasting puts us -- I mean, we don't think about it in terms of market cap. We think about it in terms of what's our CET1 ratio, our capital ratio, and this will still put us above our range, so -- well within our range, I mean. So this is something that, at this point, we feel very comfortable doing.\nEric Aboaf: And Mike, it's Eric. I'd just underscore, right, the capital and liquidity strength and ratios are just incredibly high end with us by every measure that one can see. And we've shared quite a bit of that. And that's the reason why we're comfortable at this point proceeding with our buyback. We'll -- I said in my prepared remarks, we do it through the rest of the year. I said we do it at pace. And even within a quarter, we typically start buybacks the day after earnings and then we will operate and execute on them, subject to market conditions, of course, but we typically execute on them over the eight to 10 weeks of available days during the quarter. So it's -- we'll -- we've got good confidence in the broader system and enormous confidence in our particular position here. On earnings, we'll work through the earnings issue. NII was -- is something that we can figure our balance sheet to earn when rates move up and the balance sheet does give some of that back when rates come down. And we'll obviously continue to drive our focus on fees and manage expenses and drive what really is a multi-year trajectory.\nMichael Mayo: One last time, crystal clear. So there is nothing about the reduction in the, quote, free money non-interest-bearing deposits or anything else in your results that would give you pause to continue buying back your stock.\nEric Aboaf: None.\nMichael Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Rob Wildhack of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wildhack: Hi, guys. I wanted to unpack some of the RWA dynamics in the quarter. RWAs were up 7% sequentially, but the overall balance sheet, I think, was down 3% or 4%. So can you just give us some color on what was going on there?\nEric Aboaf: Sure, Rob. It's Eric. And I think there's some materials on RWA both in the earnings deck on Page 12 and then further back in the addendum. I think if you remember, fourth quarter, we had a particularly low print in RWA, which we had signaled at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Overdrafts came in lower than expected. Some of the risk-weighted assets associated with the FX books came in lower because of the late December move in dollar rates. And so we had expected a rebound of about $10 billion, $15 billion of RWA from fourth quarter to first quarter. And you saw we got about $8 billion or $9 billion of that. We still came in a little light on overdrafts, which is fine. Part of that is the amount of cash in the system and the cash and deposits that we're holding on behalf of our clients. You see RWA is still down year-over-year, and that's because of a fair number of optimization efforts. We felt like there's real opportunities for us to grow the franchise on one hand, but deploy RWAs in very high-quality and higher returning ways on the other and support our clients. And so we've been adjusting the deployment across the FX books. You think about how much we want to deploy in the forward space and the long-dated forwards versus spot and securities finance, there are different amounts. But we're quite well off when it comes to capital and our plan is here really to continue to find ways to smartly deploy additional capital and additional RWA to drive organic growth.\nRob Wildhack: Thank you. And then I appreciate the color on the to-be installed business and the on-prem enterprise trajectory from here, but could you just remind us how long those installs typically take to convert to revenue?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. When we described the installation going into the second quarter, we were describing those as realized revenue installations. So in effect, the way the accounting works typically is when we win, we don't book the revenues, but it's only at the installation date that you begin to book them. So you'll see both the backlog assets under custody in the second quarter begin to come down and some of the servicing and middle office revenues float upwards. And similarly, for the software and data processing areas, you'll see something in that direction as well.\nRob Wildhack: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, Eric. Hi, Ron. A couple of questions. Firstly, CRD revenues, I know you said it should -- Eric, the on-premise revenue should bounce back in the second quarter, but just want to step back and look at it on a full-year basis, the entire CRD revenues. What is your expectation at this point for full-year growth in that -- looking at all those three subcomponents together?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. I don't -- Vivek, I don't know that we -- in January, we went into that level of detail. I think what we've said in the past is that that there is a range of revenue growth in our different fee categories. We've described back office as growing towards the -- traditional back office growing closer to the lower single-digit revenue growth. We've described middle and front office, which would include CRD at high single-digit growth. There will be years when it could be double-digit revenue growth. So that's what we said about that category -- this category. I think what we see in particular in software is the on-premise revenues over time will -- may not be as heavy, but we do see real momentum in the combination of the software enabled and SaaS. But all in, that should grow in the higher-single digit revenues typically though there'll be some range around that in a given year.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. And then going back to this question that's come up on the large amount of new business that remains to be installed in servicing, and you said you should see a pickup in 2Q. Ron and Eric, what's your expectation for how much of that do you expect would get installed over the course of this year, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q? And by the time we exit this year, how much should be done? And therefore, what benefit should there be to [indiscernible] from that?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. I think, Vivek, there are a couple of ways to think about that because what happens here is that it gets onboarded on -- in tranches. So we might onboard the assets under custody, administration, but there are multiple services that we're often providing for those assets. So we had a couple of wins over the last year or two years with $1 trillion. Those $1 trillion wins would have had some custody, some accounting, they might have had some performance analytics. They would have had some middle office services in many cases because they were Alpha mandates. So there is three, four or five kind of, I'll call it, revenue installations, right, for each of the balances that sit there when we describe them as assets under custody and administration. I think roughly, our view is that we'd expect about half of the backlog in custody and administration to come through during the course of this year. I'll say that roughly, right? It tends to vary. And then the revenue pieces, it won't be quite at that level because the revenues come through over time as you get the different, I'll call it, layers of services that are provided associated with those -- that assets under custody, administration. But what we'll do is we'll -- I think it's -- that may be some kind of broad perspective. What we'll try to do each quarter is give you more and more visibility as we get to those implementation points because, remember, these are implementations where not only have we configured a front-to-back offering that we've -- that we've designed for clients, but clients need to reconfigure many of their processes and systems in parallel with that to adopt. And so it's a joint effort on both sides.\nVivek Juneja: If I may sneak in one more, just CF Global, any color on what that could add to your fee revenue, Eric? And when do you expect that to start to add [indiscernible]?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah. I mean, CF Global for us is a very attractive opportunity. We've historically done some outsourced trading over the years in the U.S. and Asia. We weren't particularly large in that space in Europe. This gives us some real heft and credibility in Europe. It's an acquisition that will close likely at the end of the year. So I think it's really a 2024 topic. And we're looking at a business like that between what we have and what we're adding to be in the $30 million to $50 million range of revenues next year. Now, we've got some of that today, but this -- what we purchased in CF Global really is distinguishing in terms of capabilities, product lines, lets us build around what we have and then drive some real incremental growth. And so something we're very excited about because it fits into being the enterprise outsourcer. You do that for a custody, accounting, middle office, front office, and we do it for the CIOs of small and midsized companies. And it's really -- it fits very well with our positions -- positioning and strength.\nVivek Juneja: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Mr. O'Hanley for closing remarks.\nRonald P. O'Hanley: Thanks, operator. And thanks to all on the call for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Ronald P. O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our financial highlights, I would like to briefly reflect on the eventful operating environment in the first quarter. Investors had to contend with significant market movements and volatility, driven by persistent inflation, continued central bank interest rate increases, and the recent disruption to certain segments of the banking industry. First quarter global financial market performance was choppy. January produced a very strong start to the year with gains across most asset classes, including equities recording the strongest start to a year since 2019. However, investors remained cautious about the prospect of enduring inflation and a potential recession in the United States. February saw that encouraging start recede as strong U.S. employment data led to growing concerns about the persistence of inflation, which in turn saw market expectations for central bank rate hikes increase, fixed income and equity markets declined, and the U.S. dollar strengthen. March saw a continued rise in central bank rates, which in turn drove shocks to both the U.S. regional and international banking sectors and the need to resolve a number of banks. All this drove negative market sentiment, contributing to large inflows into money market funds and a reversal of a number of the macro trends from the prior month. Both current interest rates and rate expectations decreased and the U.S. dollar weakened, although relative calm returned to markets by the end of the quarter. Notwithstanding these events, all told, global financial markets performed relatively well in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year with broad-based gains recorded across global equities, while U.S. treasuries experienced their best quarter since the first quarter of 2020. However, daily average equity and bond market levels both remained significantly below year-ago period with average equity markets down approximately 10%, which created headwinds for our fee-driven businesses impacting our year-over-year financial results, which I will discuss shortly. Before I discuss our financial highlights, I would like to briefly comment on the recent events in parts of the banking sector. As the globally systemically important financial institution, State Street plays a critical role in the world's financial system. Our strong capital and liquidity positions, size, scale, and sophisticated risk management allow us to help safeguard investors and assist in providing market stability during uncertain times. We demonstrated this ability at the start of COVID three years ago when we helped establish the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility and the Main Street Lending Program. During the first quarter, in concert with 10 other large U.S. banks, State Street once again used its financial strength to help assist in stabilizing the financial system through the provision of liquidity to a financial institution in the U.S., reflecting our confidence in the American banking system. We stand ready to support the world's investors and the people they serve during this time of uncertainty through our investment servicing and asset management products, which offer clients opportunities, insights, and liquidity. Turning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation, I will review our first quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Relative to the year-ago period, first quarter EPS was $1.52, down 3% as the positive year-over-year benefit resulting from our continued common share repurchases as well as significantly stronger NII growth were offset by lower servicing and management fee revenues, which were impacted by weaker average market levels, continued business and personnel investments to support growth, and a loan loss provision related to State Street support of the U.S. banking system, which I just mentioned. Turning to our business momentum, we remain highly focused on continuing to advance our enterprise outsourced solutions strategy across our clients' front, middle, and back-office activities. For example, in March, we announced our agreement to acquire CF Global Trading. This transaction will further expand State Street's current outsourced trading capabilities, giving our firm the ability to provide these services to new clients and markets. Importantly, the acquisition will allow State Street to expand its liquidity providing capabilities and offer a complete global trading solution as part of our Alpha front-to-back platform. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. AUC/A amounted to $37.6 trillion at quarter-end and we recorded asset servicing wins of $112 billion in the first quarter, about half of which were higher fee rate alternative mandates, consistent with our strategy. Encouragingly, this was our second best quarterly sales performance by projected revenue within the alternative segments over the last six years. We also reported an additional Alpha mandate during the first quarter as this strategy continues to resonate with clients. Our AUC/A installation backlog amounted to $3.6 trillion at quarter-end. At State Street Global Advisors, quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.6 trillion, while flows across our asset management businesses were negatively impacted by the various market factors in the first quarter. We continue to see a number of bright spots where we are focusing our efforts. For example, in the U.S., our SPDR ETF franchise gained market share in both low-cost equity and low-cost fixed income, while we also had strong inflows into our gold ETFs amidst investor demand for safe haven assets. While aggregate flows to cash were slightly negative for the quarter, this largely resulted from seasonal outflow activity in January. However, Global Advisors gathered strong money market inflows of over $24 billion in the latter part of March amidst the market volatility. Turning to our financial condition, State Street's balance sheet, liquidity, and capital position remained strong. Our CET1 ratio was a high 12.1% at quarter-end, well above State Street's regulatory minimum. This balance sheet strength enabled us to continue to return capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, while simultaneously supporting our clients and the U.S. banking system. We returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in Q1, including buying back $1.25 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. As we look ahead in this uncertain environment, we remain highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet position, while continuing to generate and return capital as part of our previously announced common stock repurchase program of up to $4.5 billion for 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, the first quarter included a number of significant events in global financial markets and with the global -- with the broader banking industry. While market conditions were volatile, many asset classes saw sequential quarter gains, although asset prices remained depressed relative to the year ago period, which created year-over-year headwinds for our fee-driven businesses in the first quarter. While our year-over-year revenue performance was durable, supported by significantly higher net interest income growth, our results this quarter were below our expectations. We need to do better, and I believe we are equipped and on track to do so by focusing on areas within our control and effectively executing our strategy. In keeping with the strategic priorities I outlined in January, we are driving forward with a number of actions. For example, our AUC/A to be installed is strong, and by strengthening our implementation capabilities, we have line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding beginning in 2Q. Within our software and data business, we expect to convert a meaningful number of CRD on-premises clients to more recurring SaaS revenue in the second quarter. Last, given the revenue inflationary environments, we will continue to selectively reprice some services, proactively manage our cost, execute on our productivity efforts, and stand ready to utilize additional expense levers at our disposal. With the focus on accountability and execution of our strategy, I continue to firmly believe in the ability of our diversified franchise to successfully meet the needs of the world's investors and the people they serve, while delivering value for and capital to -- capital return to our shareholders. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Hi, Betsy. Yeah, Jim. It's Ron. So maybe I'll start here. On servicing fees, we -- as Eric noted, we do expect growth, and it's driven by a couple of things. One is, we've been carrying for a while now a fair amount of AUC/A to be implemented. A lot of that was tied to some systems development that needed to occur that is occurring. So we're expecting to see a hefty amount of that AUC/A to get installed. Secondly, the wins this quarter were -- while it was a low AUC/A amount, it was much more traditional back office plus this very large alternatives, both of which are easier to install, but they take less time to install. So we're actually quite pleased with how 2023 is shaping up from a sales perspective and it's good that it's shaping up early in the year. So with all that, we do expect to have a meaningful amount of servicing fee growth. That coupled with -- depending on what you believe about markets, tends to wash over everything that I'm talking about, but if you believe that there's some kind of market stability, we feel pretty good about the year as we look forward. Mike, why don't I start? I think that as you're calculating the worst case, I think your math roughly is correct. We're doing all we can to avoid the worst case, but I think your math and how you get to the earnings impact is right, assuming the -- in effect, 100% margin on the deposits. In terms of liquidity, there is nothing here that approaches a liquidity issue, right? These are custody deposits. As Eric noted, they're operating deposits. They give you a sense and a little more explanation of why we've got X number of clients, but a multiple number of accounts. And if you think about it, a mutual fund company probably has at least one account per fund they have with us, if not more. It's to actually run their funds. If you look at the liquidity coverage ratio, which Eric walked you through, it's up at 124% now. It's actually gone up, not down. So yes, this is an earnings issue and one that we intend to offset to the extent possible with the primary source of our revenue, which is fees as well as continued careful management of expenses. I mean -- Mike, I think Eric explained it well. If you look at our capital levels, and the fact that we held off buying back shares for quite a large amount of -- basically for most of last year, we feel comfortable continuing the buyback. We're obviously conscious of the environment. So we feel comfortable doing that, and we certainly feel comfortable about ourselves, but there is the system in which we live, and to the extent to which the system started to look very different from what it is today, look a whole lot more like or even worse than what we saw in March, we're certainly not going to ignore that. But our -- based on what we know now and our financial strength, we think it's actually quite prudent to do so. And our forecasting puts us -- I mean, we don't think about it in terms of market cap. We think about it in terms of what's our CET1 ratio, our capital ratio, and this will still put us above our range, so -- well within our range, I mean. So this is something that, at this point, we feel very comfortable doing. Thanks, operator. And thanks to all on the call for joining us."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on Slide 4. We reported earnings per share of $1.52 for the quarter, which included a $20 million -- a $29 million provision or $0.06 of EPS impact associated with the expansion of liquidity for U.S. financial institution, as we participated in an industry consortium supporting the banking system. We were pleased to do our part. On the left panel of the slide, you can see that our first quarter '23 results reflected the year-on-year decline in both equity and fixed income markets, but was more than offset by strength in net interest income and strong momentum in our securities finance business. EPS was down just 3% as another quarter of significant buybacks reduced the number of shares outstanding. Against this challenging backdrop, we again held total expense growth to just 2% year-on-year, even as we continued to thoughtfully invest in product and client growth initiatives. Turning now to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw period end AUC/A decrease by 10% on a year-on-year basis, but increased 2% sequentially. Year-on-year, the decrease of AUC/A was largely driven by lower period end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally, which were both down in the 10% range. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of higher period end market levels and client flows. At Global Advisors, we saw similar dynamics play out. Overall, our first quarter AUM was negatively impacted by volatile markets. Period end AUM decreased 10% year-on-year, but increased 4% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels and net outflows. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels, partially offset by some outflows. Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees down 11% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average market levels, client activity and adjustments, and normal pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down 10% year-on-year. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 1%, primarily as a result of higher average equity market levels, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments. On the bottom panel of this page, we've included some sales performance indicators, which highlight the good business momentum we again saw in the quarter. AUC/A wins in the first quarter totaled $112 billion with about half driven by wins across the growing Alternatives segment, especially in private markets. The fee rate on these alternative wins are generally more than 4 times the total servicing fee average, which makes this a strong win quarter from a projected revenue standpoint. At quarter end, AUC/A won, but yet to be installed totaled $3.6 trillion with Alpha representing a healthy portion, which, again, reflects the unique value proposition of our strategy. Given the planning and preparation since these deals were announced, we expect significant onboardings of this uninstalled AUC/A next quarter. Turning to Slide 7. First quarter management fees were $457 million, down 12% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average market levels and a previously reported client specific pricing adjustment. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were flat as higher market levels were partially offset by outflows and day count. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, notwithstanding the difficult macroeconomic backdrop in the quarter, our franchise remains well positioned, as evidenced by our continued strong business momentum. In ETFs, we continued to build on strategic growth segments, which is reflected in net flows in our SPDR portfolio low cost equity and fixed income suites. In our institutional business, we saw net outflows while sustaining continued momentum in defined contribution with the Target Date franchise recording inflows of $6 billion. Across our cash franchise, consistent with industry trends late in the first quarter, we saw a flight to quality with significant net inflows worth 7% of cash AUM into SSGA money market funds since the week ending March 10th, which largely reversed the seasonal outflows experienced earlier in the quarter. Turning now to Slide 8. Relative to the period a year ago, first quarter FX trading services revenue was down 5%, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes partially offset by higher spreads. As a reminder, the start of the war in Europe last year caused some unusually high FX trading activity in 1Q '22. Sequentially, FX trading services revenue ex-notables was down 1% with lower spreads offset by 6% higher client volumes. And consistent with the significant increases into industry wide money market flows, our GlobalLink franchise experienced an increase of $20 billion or 13% into its money market cash sweep program during the last three weeks of March. Securities finance performed well in the first quarter with revenues up 14% year-on-year, driven by higher specials activity and an active focus on business returns, partially offset by lower balances, which was consistent with the industry. Sequentially, revenues were up 6%, again mainly driven by higher specials activity, which was consistent with the market and securities lending industry environment. Moving onto software and processing fees. First quarter software and processing fees were down 18% year-on-year and 24% sequentially, primarily driven by lumpy on-premise renewals in the front-office software revenues, which I'll turn to shortly. Lending fees for the quarter were down both year-on-year and sequentially, primarily due to a shift away from products with higher fees, but lower returns. Finally, other fee revenue increased $16 million year-on-year, primarily due to positive market-related adjustments and $27 million sequentially, largely due to fair value adjustments on equity investments. Moving to Slide 9. You'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue declined year-on-year, primarily as a result of lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by continued growth in software enabled revenue. Timing of installations will vary quarter-on-quarter based on the size and scope of prior business wins and we expect several SaaS conversions and several on-premise renewals to come through in the second quarter. Year-on-year, our annualized recurring revenue was 16%. Our software enabled revenue was up 11% year-on-year, but down sequentially due to the absence of an accounting true-up in fourth quarter. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics on the right panel. We were pleased to report another Alpha mandate win in the asset owner client segment. In addition to the reported win this quarter, we expect significant middle-office installations in 2Q as we've completed the preparations to begin to onboard a portion of a large mandate won back in 2021. Turning to Slide 10. First quarter NII increased 50% year-on-year, but declined 3% sequentially to $766 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-term rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower deposits. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by additional client rotation out of non-interest bearing deposit balances, partially offset by higher short term market rates from central bank hikes. On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the first quarter. Year-on-year average assets declined 6% and 2% sequentially. Average deposits declined 3% quarter-on-quarter, which is relatively consistent with our expectation for first quarter seasonality and client pricing preferences during periods of rising rates. Of note, average weekly deposit levels at quarter end increased 5% as we compare with week -- with the week ended March 10. The stress in the regional bank space primarily affected consumer and corporate depositors rather than the institutional asset manager and asset owners that we serve. We, in contrast, saw some risk off deposit inflows at the end of the quarter. Our operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remain consistent at 75%. These are determined by regulatory guidance. U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 80% to 90% during the quarter, as expected. Foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower, in the 30% to 45% range, depending on currency. Our international footprint continues to be an advantage. Turning to Slide 11. Our first quarter expenses excluding notable items increased just 2% year-on-year or up approximately 4% adjusted for currency translation. In the light of the current revenue environment, we're actively managing expenses, while continuing to carefully invest in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations automation. Compensation and employee benefits increased 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher salary increases associated with the wage inflation and higher headcount attributable to lower attrition rates and in-sourcing. Total non-compensation expenses, on the other hand, decreased 1% year-on-year as continued productivity and optimization savings more than offset increases in certain variable costs and professional services. On a line-by-line basis for non-compensation expenses, information systems and communications expenses were down 2% due to benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was down 9%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs from declining market levels as well as lower broker fees. And other expenses were up 9%, mainly reflecting the higher professional fees, travel, and marketing costs. Moving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with extremely strong capital levels, which are well above our targets, let alone the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio was up slightly year-on-year, but down 1.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 12.1%, which was largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program and the expected normalization of RWAs that we discussed last quarter. Tier 1 leverage ratio was flattish at 5.9%. Our LCR for State Street Corporation increased a couple of percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 108% and 4 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 124% for State Street Bank and Trust where most of our businesses transacted. We were quite pleased to return $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, consisting of $1.25 billion of common share repurchases and $212 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, given the high level of capital across every measure, positive pull-to-par in AOCI and our strong earnings trajectory, we continue to expect to return up to $4.5 billion of capital in the form of buybacks at pace this year, subject to market conditions of course. Turning to Slide 13, which provides a summary of our first quarter results. While there is certainly still work to do, we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a very challenging backdrop and the continued competitive strength of our global franchise. Next, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter. At a macro level, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggest the Fed, ECB and Bank of England, all continue to hike to varying degrees in 2Q. In terms of markets, we currently expect average U.S. equity and global bond markets to be up about 1% to 2% quarter-on-quarter and international equity markets to be flattish. Regarding fee revenue in 2Q and on a sequential quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 4% to 5% with servicing fees up 1% to 2% and management fees approximately flat to up 1%. We expect to see a significant increase in front office software and data revenues as we have line of sight to a number of on-premise renewals and SaaS conversions in 2Q. In our other fee revenue line, which we know is difficult to forecast, we intend to adopt in 2Q the new accounting guidance recently issued regarding renewable energy investments. We would expect to see a sequential quarter uptick in total other revenues of between $5 million to $15 million, but this estimate always depends on market levels. As we adopt this accounting change, our effective tax rate for 2Q '23 is expected to be approximately 21%. The adoption will be roughly neutral to EPS. Regarding NII, we now expect NII in the second quarter to decrease 5% to 10% sequentially, primarily driven by the non-interest bearing deposit rotation and interest-bearing deposit betas as quantitative tightening and rate hikes continue into 2Q. Turning to expenses. We remain focused on driving productivity and controlling costs in this environment. We expect that second quarter expenses will be flat on a sequential quarter basis, excluding the 1Q seasonal compensation cost of $181 million. Overall, we will offset some of the 2Q NII trends with higher fee revenues as business momentum builds in 2Q and through the year and we continue to actively manage expenses. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Yeah, Ken. It's Eric. The largest driver of our NII trends right now, whether it's the fourth quarter to the first quarter or first quarter to second quarter is really the level of non-interest-bearing deposits. Those came down this past quarter about $5 billion. We had expected them to come down about $3.5 billion. And we do a fair amount of forecasting on this. We think about January, February. March, it usually comes through in a U shape and we actually had a -- had some of the opposite play through in March. And so that's what's been driving some of the change in NII. And in contrast, we've actually seen good flows in interest-bearing deposits at the same time. So there is a fair amount going on under the surface. As we look into second quarter, we expect this pace of non-interest-bearing deposits to continue to rotate. So if you step back, last year, we had periods where non-interest-bearing deposits were up $1 billion; then down $2 billion; then down $4 billion; then down $2 billion, right? It's been quite volatile. And right now we're expecting non-interest-bearing deposits probably to come down another $4 billion, $5 billion into the second quarter. And if you think about it, when you earn 5% or more for those kinds of deposits on the asset side and then pay zero, that can be a significant -- that's a significant amount of NII, right? Every $1 billion is worth $12 million, sometimes $15 million per quarter. And so that's what we are seeing flowing through. The hard work we're trying to do from a forecasting standpoint, and forecasting is always hard, is where does the trend -- how does that trend play out and we do some of what you probably do, which is we've looked at the last peak and the last low of non-interest-bearing deposits. The peak was 22%; the last low was 18%. On the other hand, in dollar terms, the last peak was $50 billion, and the last low was about $30 billion, and right now, we're sitting at about $39 billion. And so that's what's really playing through the NII forecast. And then as we play that out, we expect to see some of that non-interest-bearing deposit rotate into interest-bearing deposits, but to be honest, some of our clients who are sophisticated institutions are also looking at some of the other strong rates that they can get either in treasuries or money market funds. And so, at this point in the cycle, with the high level of prevailing rates, we expect deposits probably to trend down another few billion into the second quarter, but this is all kind of dependent on client behavior and activity as we take a look at our forecast. Yeah. I think clients are -- the clients (ph) are making a variety of different decisions here. And I think part of what - why we're seeing, what we're seeing is that we've not lived in an environment where interest rates are at 5%, whether you put that at the Fed or in three and six-month treasuries, right? And so clients have a fair amount of alternatives and they're thinking about how to deploy, how to maximize interest and yields for their own clients, especially the kind of clients we have who are -- over time will always be price-sensitive. When it comes to the operational nature of the deposits, you can see from our disclosure and we added some of this, clients are incredibly sticky and stable from an operational standpoint. Operational deposit balances were steady and the operational percentages continue to be very -- in a very narrow band. You have clients with several billions of dollars each often, but they typically have hundreds, if not thousands of individual accounts with very significant transactional and payment flows, and that's why they're categorized as operational in nature. And so that behavior hasn't changed. What we -- that behavior of core custodial deposits is deeply ingrained in the structure of those accounts, the processing we do for them, the avoidance of overdrafts that they always try to -- that they don't want to -- that they don't want. I think what we're seeing instead is clients on the margin will find, for their discretionary, the last dollar of $100 of deposits, they're going to be rate-seeking. And at these prevailing rates, there is -- they're going to look here and there. Now sometimes, we match them with those rates. So we'll offer deposits at exception rates. Sometimes we help them with their sweeps or some of their treasury repo interest. And so there is a variety of different ways we serve our clients and we'll continue to do that. But clearly, at this point in the rate cycle, you kind of have some of the patterns that you and we would expect to have. Thanks for the question. I think we'll continue to see a range of behaviors across the geographies. I mean, I think the way I would describe them is in the U.S., with prevailing rates at where they are, you have this non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing rotation on one hand. And then you have clients nudging on pricing in general. And we're kind of at that point where clients now have incentives, just like we do, to find a place to settle at with us. I think in Europe and pound sterling, it's still new, right? We've just been at the kind of the first, maybe half, two-thirds of the rate increases. And there, the betas continue to be in that 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% range and are quite attractive for us. They're good for clients because the clients tend to have somewhat fewer alternatives in those international jurisdictions relative to the U.S. on one hand. On the other, there tends to be a more -- there tends to be less price sensitivity on the deposits. And we do expect that to continue. And I think with more rate increases flowing through in the international jurisdictions, that allow us to continue to lag modestly the deposit rates that we offer to see those play through. Yeah. Good question, and it's something that we've been very deliberate and thoughtful about. You can imagine, as we saw the events in March unfold, we've been thinking daily and weekly about how stable is the broader banking system. The starting point for us is we've got an incredibly strong balance sheet, right? Our capital ratios are in the 12% range. That's 100 basis points above the top end of our range, 200 basis points higher than the bottom of our range. It's 400 basis points above the regulatory requirements. And you know many run much thinner in terms of regulatory requirements. And we've always chosen to run with this kind of -- with a healthy buffer. So I think on one hand, the starting point for us is important in our ongoing decisioning around capital return, and we're conscious of that. On the other hand, just like you say, we assess the market conditions and the environment, not for us, because this is not about us. This is about what's happened in some of the other parts of the banking system. We assess those. And if we would had economic and banking conditions like they were at the beginning of March, I think we'd have a -- we'd make different statements around our capital buyback. And so we feel like there has been a fair amount of healing since the beginning, middle of March, and we think that gives us -- that factors into our thinking. And then what we'll do is we'll continue to evaluate conditions, right, if market conditions and systemic conditions get more concerning for the system, we'll -- we may pace these differently if they continue to be at these levels of stability that we're at, we feel confident that, that we can and should continue to proceed. But it will be a week-by-week reassessment. Our buybacks aren't once and done. They're done over the course of the next eight to 10 weeks. And this is one of those quarters where you do them more linearly than not. And so we'll evaluate. But our position of strength is just quite -- I think quite high and gives us a fair amount of latitude. Betsy, there is a couple of different ways we look at this. And clearly, we're one quarter into the year. We've started to give some outlook for second quarter, and we need to see how the conditions and the environment plays out because equity markets up or down, bond markets up or down by more than a percentage point or 2 is going to impact our revenues. And so I think it's still early in the year. We set out this year to drive positive operating leverage and continue to look for ways to do that, but we need more information about the external conditions to really see that. I think as we think about the opportunities here though, NII will trend positively for the year, but not as positively as we would have expected. So that's a consideration. You saw that we took up our fee guide for the second quarter, and so that gives us a little more ballast or breathing room or momentum, to be honest. And we'll continue to manage expenses quite actively. I would say in the last year and a half, as NII was up 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, right, we didn't spend that on the expense line, right? We were quite conscious of continuing to drive investment, but also productivity and calibrate it in our expense growth. And so as we look forward, we'll continue to do that, but obviously, with a -- we'll keep track of the direction of revenues and obviously try to adapt where we can. Yeah. It's -- the revenue impact on that line is a little bit of both, and we're still discerning all the specifics in doing the forecasting. In second quarter, we have -- we need to do a year-to-date catch-up. That's how the accounting guidance is written. And then there will be some additional revenues in the third and fourth quarter, not as much as there would be from the second quarter catch-up. So we're trying to map that out. And as the quarter proceeds, we'll try to get a little more guidance out. But that line will tend to have -- instead of kind of being centered around zero, will be centered around a slightly higher number in the coming quarters, and we'll try to get some guidance out on that as we go through all the forecasts. Gerard, it's Eric. We're -- we've been quite careful over the years of running a portfolio with a modest amount of duration. I think it's typically in the two and a half to 2.8 years in that -- that provides us some amount of benefit from what historically has been steepness in the yield curve. It's also given us some ability to create some amount of stabilization in NII without forsaking the opportunity to benefit from interest rate rises, which is what we've been able to do over the last two years. We like that amount of duration because it also protects the income statement as rates fall, and we'll see if that -- if there is -- if there are rate cuts late in the year or next year or the year after that. So that gives us some stability as well. I think what I'd tell you though is, we spend as much time on duration curve shape as we do on carefully also running some MBS portfolios where there is some additional yield pickup, but you've got to be careful in terms of the level of convexity risk that you take. And then because of our deposit franchise, as was mentioned earlier, we're doing this around the globe. We've got about a third of our balance sheets in international jurisdictions, and that gives us real opportunities in pound sterling, euro, Canadian, Aussie dollars et cetera to invest. And we may run somewhat different duration levels in those different currencies. We might be shorter in one, longer in other, partly to reflect our views on the rate cycle and where each of those are. So there is a range of kind of approaches that we take there, and we find that our flexibility gives us some opportunities to deliver some good yields in NII, but obviously being careful. We don't want to stretch for duration. We don't want to stretch for yield. We want to continue to run a conservative portfolio like we have for many, many years. Yeah. Let me do that in reverse order. The operational accounts are sometimes interest-bearing, sometimes non-interest-bearing. So there is a wide variety of different pricing structures, but they tend to be -- remember -- and these are thousands of accounts oftentimes for each of our -- for each of the asset managers or asset owners that we custody for. And it's less about the pricing in those accounts than about the nature of the accounts and the payment transactions that clients are funding in effect with the deposits that they leave with us. In terms of non-interest-bearing deposits, I do think we'll continue to see a trend downwards. We saw a $5 billion trend this past quarter, which was $1 billion or $2 billion more than we had expected even back at that early -- even back when we last gave guidance. We expect probably another $4 billion, $5 billion will come out in the second quarter. And then I think we do believe that there is going to begin to be some stabilization. I'd be inclined to think that we'll get to that $30 billion probably later this year, but this is where there is no amount of crystal-balling that we can provide. It's hard to really be sure it could be at that level, it could be around that level. There is -- we've seen movements in non-interest-bearing month by month that are plus/minus $4 billion or $5 billion. Even in April, as an example, we've had days where non-interest bearings were in the $44 billion level, so $5 billion above the recent average and days when they were at the $34 billion level. So it's that kind of range and volatility that we're trying to forecast through, but clearly, the trend's here, and I think the last benchmark of that -- around that $30 billion level may be one that we approach potentially later this year. Okay. Yeah. And Jim, it's Eric. Just to round that out, Ron's covered servicing fees. Management fees should give us some lift as well as we have some equity market appreciation -- equity and bond market appreciation into the second quarter. I think if you go through the trading lines, second quarter is usually good. We'll have to see just how much volumes play through in spread, so -- but you've seen we've been making nice headway given the market volatility with specials and sec finance that will likely continue. In the software and processing line, we had one of the lowest on-premise renewal quarters this -- in 1Q. And that one just varies. If you just you look at some of the materials in the deck, that could be $6 million, it could be $60 million. That was literally the swing from fourth quarter to first quarter. We expect, as we had said, some sizable upticks there as well. So there is a range of areas. And in effect, from a management standpoint, we're focused on every one of the opportunities and businesses and harnessing the client momentum that we've been seeing. Yeah. No, I understand the perspective. I think what I will remind you on software and processing, we had an unusually low print in the first quarter. So the first part of the follow up (ph) in second quarter is rebound and then continuation. On-premise revenues have averaged about $30 million a quarter, for example. That's a reasonable kind of average that one could expect, but we printed $6 million this past quarter. So it's that kind of, I think, rebound we're expecting in the second quarter and then it should stay within the averages. And then beyond that, to your point, there are the more annuity-like areas, whether it's the software enabled, the SaaS revenues in software, whether it's some of the -- we have very flow-oriented FX and securities finance books. And then as Ron mentioned, we're seeing increasing momentum in servicing fees and management fees, and the servicing fee momentum is spread as we've mentioned, both in terms of back office and in middle office, which gives us additional diversity. It's hard for us to predict the second half of the year, and I'll hesitate every April to re-estimate the full year, but I think we'll know more as we get to June and July, and I'll certainly give -- be able to give you an indication. But we've -- we're certainly seeing momentum of activity with clients and expect some of these onboardings to come through. And we think that provides a step-up and then there should be some continuation beyond second quarter that will be positive. Yeah. Yes. I mean, the -- this is where the forecasts just have a wide range of outcomes. I think given the first quarter report and what we expect in the second quarter, we don't think that one can reach that -- at up 20% for the full year. I think what we're wrestling with is just what's the pace of rotation and what's the pace of some of the price sensitivity that we see in the U.S. clients at this point in the cycle. And that's what's harder to determine. So there is a range of forecasts we have. And if I had to kind of share with you, I'd say if one thinks of it in a more dour way and expects more rotation and more price sensitivity, NII could be up 5% to 10% this year instead of 20%. On the other hand, if one's optimistic and believes some of the history, where there is real attenuation in the non-interest-bearing deposits, NII could be up 10% to 15%. So there is a larger range than usual in the forecast that we have. And to be honest, just like I quoted some of the April year-to-date data and the range of levels that we're seeing, we expect that those -- we expect to be -- that there will be quite a bit of range in the outcomes, just really hard to predict. But maybe that gives you some perspective. It's probably a larger range than you're looking for, but we're trying to be as transparent and forthcoming as we can given the facts and the information that we have here. No, I don't think it's really the events of the last month, which are really in very different client segments, different geographies. Those are very different from what we do and who we serve. And we had a little bit of a flight to quality -- not flight to quality; we had a bit of this risk-off sentiment with deposits, but that's just a whole different ecosystem than those clients that we serve. I think what's really happening here and what we've been trying to estimate, but maybe is unestimatable or unforecastable is just how do clients operate when prevailing rates are at 5% in the United States, right? We've not had that scenario in our -- for some of us in our careers, right? But for some of us, going back many, many -- probably two decades. And so the data is thin on that question. And I think what we've seen is back in January, when we had given some of our NII guidance for the quarter, just on non-interest-bearing deposits, we had seen one quarter where they were up a little bit, one quarter where they were down $5 billion. And then the third to fourth quarter, they were down $2 billion, right? So you're in this situation where you're trying to guess, forecast, estimate we can -- we've got to use all those words. And I think we thought we might have reached some attenuation, but we didn't. There was another step of rotation playing through. It's not a rational for clients to do that, and so they've shifted. Now they shift from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing. They shift across currency sometimes because of their sophistication. I think what's interesting is that we actually got more deposits in the U.S. and we had some outflows in -- or some net reductions in Europe and in Asia. And so you kind of have a real mix out there. And I think what we're realizing is all the data sets we have are actually not -- there is not enough data on this question of deposit or, I'll call it, deposit or pricing behavior because that's what this is about. And that's what we're trying to better estimate. But the clients we're serving, we're continuing to serve, the momentum in the business is clear. And just like NII went up faster than we had thought, I think there is a trend here that it's coming down a bit sequentially. It's still going to be up for the full year, but we'll need to see how much. Yeah. It's good question. I mean, the -- aside from the provision that's calculated using all the CECL techniques and fairly regimented that we had for that -- for the one cash placement that we made, the provision was about $15 million. I think for us, provisions have been in the $5 million, $10 million, $15 million range typically. We've seen a little bit of migration or change in ratings in a half dozen credits, but it's the kind of thing that plays through. And part of that is we have higher prevailing rates, and that puts a little bit of pressure in different parts of the economy and I think it's probably fairly typical. I think the -- we run quite a high-quality and high grade lending book. Even where we're a little more down market, we call BBs down market, right? So we have a ratings distributions that are typically in the A or A- or even better range. So we'll have some sensitivity to economic conditions. You can go back to around the start of COVID, right? A number of banks built reserves, that can give you a sense of sensitivity. But what we feel like we're well reserved now given what we know, both on the economic conditions and individual positions that we hold. It's highly diversified. It's high quality. And we'll obviously -- we'll continue to monitor, but feel like it's reasonably stable with a little bit of drift down situation just given the direction of rates in the economy. And Mike, it's Eric. I'd just underscore, right, the capital and liquidity strength and ratios are just incredibly high end with us by every measure that one can see. And we've shared quite a bit of that. And that's the reason why we're comfortable at this point proceeding with our buyback. We'll -- I said in my prepared remarks, we do it through the rest of the year. I said we do it at pace. And even within a quarter, we typically start buybacks the day after earnings and then we will operate and execute on them, subject to market conditions, of course, but we typically execute on them over the eight to 10 weeks of available days during the quarter. So it's -- we'll -- we've got good confidence in the broader system and enormous confidence in our particular position here. On earnings, we'll work through the earnings issue. NII was -- is something that we can figure our balance sheet to earn when rates move up and the balance sheet does give some of that back when rates come down. And we'll obviously continue to drive our focus on fees and manage expenses and drive what really is a multi-year trajectory. None. Sure, Rob. It's Eric. And I think there's some materials on RWA both in the earnings deck on Page 12 and then further back in the addendum. I think if you remember, fourth quarter, we had a particularly low print in RWA, which we had signaled at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Overdrafts came in lower than expected. Some of the risk-weighted assets associated with the FX books came in lower because of the late December move in dollar rates. And so we had expected a rebound of about $10 billion, $15 billion of RWA from fourth quarter to first quarter. And you saw we got about $8 billion or $9 billion of that. We still came in a little light on overdrafts, which is fine. Part of that is the amount of cash in the system and the cash and deposits that we're holding on behalf of our clients. You see RWA is still down year-over-year, and that's because of a fair number of optimization efforts. We felt like there's real opportunities for us to grow the franchise on one hand, but deploy RWAs in very high-quality and higher returning ways on the other and support our clients. And so we've been adjusting the deployment across the FX books. You think about how much we want to deploy in the forward space and the long-dated forwards versus spot and securities finance, there are different amounts. But we're quite well off when it comes to capital and our plan is here really to continue to find ways to smartly deploy additional capital and additional RWA to drive organic growth. Yeah. When we described the installation going into the second quarter, we were describing those as realized revenue installations. So in effect, the way the accounting works typically is when we win, we don't book the revenues, but it's only at the installation date that you begin to book them. So you'll see both the backlog assets under custody in the second quarter begin to come down and some of the servicing and middle office revenues float upwards. And similarly, for the software and data processing areas, you'll see something in that direction as well. Yeah. I don't -- Vivek, I don't know that we -- in January, we went into that level of detail. I think what we've said in the past is that that there is a range of revenue growth in our different fee categories. We've described back office as growing towards the -- traditional back office growing closer to the lower single-digit revenue growth. We've described middle and front office, which would include CRD at high single-digit growth. There will be years when it could be double-digit revenue growth. So that's what we said about that category -- this category. I think what we see in particular in software is the on-premise revenues over time will -- may not be as heavy, but we do see real momentum in the combination of the software enabled and SaaS. But all in, that should grow in the higher-single digit revenues typically though there'll be some range around that in a given year. Yeah. I think, Vivek, there are a couple of ways to think about that because what happens here is that it gets onboarded on -- in tranches. So we might onboard the assets under custody, administration, but there are multiple services that we're often providing for those assets. So we had a couple of wins over the last year or two years with $1 trillion. Those $1 trillion wins would have had some custody, some accounting, they might have had some performance analytics. They would have had some middle office services in many cases because they were Alpha mandates. So there is three, four or five kind of, I'll call it, revenue installations, right, for each of the balances that sit there when we describe them as assets under custody and administration. I think roughly, our view is that we'd expect about half of the backlog in custody and administration to come through during the course of this year. I'll say that roughly, right? It tends to vary. And then the revenue pieces, it won't be quite at that level because the revenues come through over time as you get the different, I'll call it, layers of services that are provided associated with those -- that assets under custody, administration. But what we'll do is we'll -- I think it's -- that may be some kind of broad perspective. What we'll try to do each quarter is give you more and more visibility as we get to those implementation points because, remember, these are implementations where not only have we configured a front-to-back offering that we've -- that we've designed for clients, but clients need to reconfigure many of their processes and systems in parallel with that to adopt. And so it's a joint effort on both sides. Yeah. I mean, CF Global for us is a very attractive opportunity. We've historically done some outsourced trading over the years in the U.S. and Asia. We weren't particularly large in that space in Europe. This gives us some real heft and credibility in Europe. It's an acquisition that will close likely at the end of the year. So I think it's really a 2024 topic. And we're looking at a business like that between what we have and what we're adding to be in the $30 million to $50 million range of revenues next year. Now, we've got some of that today, but this -- what we purchased in CF Global really is distinguishing in terms of capabilities, product lines, lets us build around what we have and then drive some real incremental growth. And so something we're very excited about because it fits into being the enterprise outsourcer. You do that for a custody, accounting, middle office, front office, and we do it for the CIOs of small and midsized companies. And it's really -- it fits very well with our positions -- positioning and strength."

Now, I would like to introduce Elizabeth Lynn, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street.\nElizabeth Lynn: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first, then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2024 earnings presentation, which is available for download on the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterward, we'll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our presentation. In addition, today's call will include forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results, which we released earlier this morning, demonstrate the accelerating financial performance and strong business momentum we are achieving this year, which in turn positions State Street well for future growth. We achieved robust fee and total revenue growth and generated positive fee and total operating leverage in 3Q, which, when combined with increased capital return quarter-on-quarter, drove strong earnings growth for our shareholders on both the year-over-year and sequential basis, with quarterly EPS reaching the highest on record. In addition to strong 3Q results, our year-to-date results also highlight the strength of our franchise and financial performance in three quarters of the way through the year, with solid fee and total revenue growth and good expense discipline driving better than expected positive fee and positive total operating leverage, as well as strong earnings growth relative to the same period in 2023 and excluding notable items. The operating environment in the third quarter was dynamic. While global equity and fixed income markets moved notably higher, the world's investors faced a number of risk-off events in 3Q, including fears of a U.S. recession, the unwinding of the carry trade, concerns over tech valuations and continued geopolitical tensions. These events drove bouts of negative market sentiment and significant market volatility. However, these market dislocations proved to be short lived with markets taking comfort from a host of subsequently dovish Central Bank pivots, including the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve in four years, as well as improved economic data in the U.S. We supported clients and navigated well through this market backdrop, delivering strong business and financial performance. We remain laser-focused on successfully executing against our key strategic priorities to drive better results, which I will now discuss. Turning to Slide 2 of our investor presentation, our third quarter EPS was $2.26 as compared to $1.25 in the year-ago period. Excluding notable items, we delivered strong earnings growth of 17% year-over-year with record quarterly EPS, while 3Q ROE was a strong 12%. Relative to the year-ago quarter and excluding notable items, fee and total revenue growth was robust at 7% and 9%, respectively, and in turn driving margin expansion. All areas of our business contributed to this year-over-year revenue growth and NII was significantly higher. Q3 servicing fees increased 3% year-over-year and we are pleased by the sales momentum we continue to see within the Investment Services business as we execute well against the sharpened strategy that we outlined last year. At the same time, expenses remained well-controlled despite increases in revenue-related costs. We continue to drive transformation and productivity savings, which are funding significant investments in our business this year. As a result, while 3Q expenses increased by 6% year-over-year, on a year-to-date basis, expenses increased by just 3%, excluding notable items relative to the same period in 2023. Turning to our business momentum, which you can see in the middle of the slide, we achieved a great deal in the third quarter. Our business performance indicators, including wins, clearly illustrate the effectiveness of our strategy and positioning State Street to support our clients, compete better and gain share. Within Investment Services, in 3Q, we generated strong AUC/A wins of $466 billion, with new servicing fee revenue wins of $84 million, the highest quarter this year. 3Q provided another clear demonstration of the power of State Street Alpha, which brings together the full depth and breadth of our servicing and software solutions. Alpha is a clear competitive advantage, which strategically positions us to retain business at even higher levels, win new long-term relationships, and, as evidenced this quarter, deepen existing relationships in a meaningful way. We reported two new Alpha mandates in 3Q, with Alpha accounting for the vast majority of our AUC/A wins this quarter, as State Street was awarded a significant mandate by a premier large global asset manager. This win illustrates the compelling value proposition of our front-to-back solution for clients. What started as a front-office Charles River client will now extend to include a host of middle- and back-office services, including custody, all underpinned by our Alpha Data Platform and Data Services. We are also very pleased with the momentum at Global Advisors this quarter. Our cash, ETF and institutional businesses all had positive net flows, including record quarterly flows in cash and strong ETF flows. In aggregate, quarterly total net flows of $100 billion and quarter-end assets under management of $4.7 trillion both reached record levels in 3Q. Importantly, we expanded our market share in a number of key product areas and geographies. For example, we improved our institutional money market fund rank this quarter, while Spider also gained share in both U.S. low cost and commodities, as well as in the EMEA region. We also continue to innovate and strategically expand Global Advisors' capabilities and client solutions. For example, Global Advisors launched 20 new ETFs in 3Q, including three actively-managed digital asset-focused ETFs. We also announced a new relationship with Apollo Global Management that will aim to expand investor access to private market opportunities. Turning to our Markets businesses, stronger client volumes in both FX trading services and securities finance helped to drive revenues higher, both sequentially and year-over-year. I was particularly pleased to see State Street named as a leader in the four categories by Euromoney Magazine in its 2024 FX Awards, including the world's Best FX Bank for Client Service as well as Research, which underscores the value clients place in our Markets franchise. Turning to our balance sheet, our year-over-year NII performance was strong, as a number of targeted management actions over the last year have helped to support NII growth. Our balance sheet is solid, enabling over $670 million of capital return in 3Q, including $450 million of share repurchases. As we look ahead, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders in the fourth quarter, subject to market conditions and other factors. Before I turn it over to Eric, we also announced this morning that Eric will be leaving State Street to pursue a new opportunity outside of banking. We have commenced a formal search process to identify his replacement, and Eric will stay on with us through mid-February to support us through this transition. I and the team have been fortunate to work closely with Eric over the last eight years. Personally, I have enjoyed and valued our partnership, and want to thank Eric for his leadership and wish him well in his new role. With that, let me hand the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron. Before I get into the numbers, I want to say that it has been a privilege to have been here at State Street and to have worked with you and the team. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished together over the past eight years, and it's with mixed feelings that I'm moving on. But I know that the progress will continue and that State Street is well-positioned with a strong financial foundation and strategy for success. And I look forward to working with the team into 2025 during the transition. Now, let me walk everyone through our results for the third quarter. Starting on Slide 3, we reported record EPS of $2.26 for the third quarter, which included notable revenue items that, in aggregate, were neutral to earnings and are detailed on the right side of the page. You can see that we took the opportunity to do some additional repositioning of the investment portfolio this quarter, which I'll talk more about in a moment. We delivered robust EPS growth of 17% year-on-year, excluding notable items, reflecting broad-based fee growth, higher NII and continued capital return, which increased on a sequential quarter basis. Our third quarter performance builds upon our strong first half of the year, as healthy fee and total revenue growth coupled with expense discipline delivered both positive fee and positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items, in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. The quarter clearly demonstrates good margins and returns with pre-tax margin at almost 28.5% and ROE of 12% and a return on tangible common equity of over 19%. Turning now to Slide 4, the third quarter period-end AUC/A and AUM, again, increased to record levels, supported by both equity and bond market tailwinds as well as strong client flows. As you can see on the right panel of the slide, after an eventful third quarter, the various external indicators for our Markets businesses were mixed. That said, we were encouraged by the continued growth in client volumes and balances across our FX trading and securities finance businesses, which I'll discuss more in detail shortly. Turning to Slide 5, third quarter servicing fees increased 3% year-on-year, as higher average market levels and new business were partially offset by pricing headwinds and previously disclosed client transition and lower client activity, including an asset mix shift. The impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth, while lower client activity, including an asset mix shift into cash, was a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point to year-on-year growth, which seems to be abating somewhat. We do feel good about servicing fee momentum going into the fourth quarter. Encouragingly, we generated $84 million of revenue wins in the quarter, the majority of which were driven by back-office mandates, in line with our strategic focus. Over the past four quarters, we've achieved nearly $330 million of servicing fee revenue wins. Moving to Slide 6, third quarter management fees increased 10% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average market levels as well as record quarterly net flows, with positive inflows across all three major product lines. We gained market share within our cash business due to strong investment performance and expanded distribution, as well as in ETFs where our strategic repricing initiative contributed to the strong flow performance and continued ETF market share gains. Taken together, our Investment Management business demonstrated strong growth in the quarter while also generating a healthy pre-tax margin of approximately 30%, up over 2 percentage points year-on-year. Importantly, as Ron mentioned earlier, we continue to position Global Advisors for success by further expanding its capabilities and client solutions and meeting the evolving needs of investors in key growth areas, such as digital assets, private markets and innovative fixed income solutions. Now, turning to Slide 7, as I noted, this quarter, we are pleased to see continued growth in our Markets businesses with higher volumes across nearly all of our FX venues relative to the year-ago period. FX trading revenue increased 15% year-on-year, excluding notable items, driven by higher client volumes with particular strength in emerging markets. Securities finance revenues increased 13% year-on-year, reflecting higher agency lending balances and share gains with excellent performance in prime services as we put more balance sheet to work to support our clients. Moving on to software and processing fees, revenues were up 11% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher front-office software and data revenues associated with CRD, which is described in greater detail on the following slide. Turning to Slide 8, our third quarter front-office software revenues increased 12% year-on-year with our software-enabled and professional services revenues up a strong 21%. We are pleased with the robust growth we've consistently delivered in our software business, with revenues up 10% year-to-date. This level of growth supports our belief that our software business has the potential to reach $1 billion of revenue over the next five years. And as Ron noted, we reported two additional Alpha mandate wins in the quarter, and we remain confident in achieving our goal of winning six to eight new Alpha clients this year. Moving to Slide 9, third quarter NII increased 16% year-on-year to $723 million as higher investment security yields and higher loan growth more than offset continued deposit rotation. On a sequential basis, NII was 2% lower, primarily driven by continued deposit rotation, as well as by the impact of lower short-end rates stemming from Central Bank actions. This dynamic was partially offset by higher investment security yields, as well as additional lending and sponsored repo activity. The market dynamics for the sponsored repo product were constructive in the quarter. As detailed on the right panel of this slide, average investment portfolio balances increased both sequentially and year-on-year. We also opportunistically repositioned a small portion of the book late in the quarter, which has a payback of approximately five quarters, benefiting NII over the next two years. Average deposits increased 14% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter, as we continue to realize the benefits of our client engagement efforts. As we move into 4Q, we'd expect to generally operate around these levels, albeit with a bit of continued noninterest-bearing deposit rotation. Turning to Slide 10, year-on-year, third quarter expense growth was 6%, primarily driven by higher performance base instead of compensation and revenue-related costs, which were worth about half of the increase, as well as important investments in products, technology and infrastructure. We remain acutely focused on managing our cost base, as demonstrated by year-on-year expense growth of just 3% on a year-to-date basis, excluding notable items. As Ron mentioned, in the third quarter, we continued to deliver productivity benefits through transformation of our operating model and other savings initiatives, achieving roughly $125 million of year-on-year savings for a variety of actions. Year-to-date, we delivered roughly $350 million of savings, and we're on track to achieve our productivity savings target of $500 million this year. We're continuing to benefit from our ongoing organizational simplification. Process improvements and automation initiative, which has enabled us to further improve service quality while also lowering our headcount on a pro forma basis, including the JV consolidation by 4% year-on-year as detailed on the bottom left of the slide. Moving to Slide 11, as you can see, our capital, leverage and liquidity levels all remain very strong. As of quarter-end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.6% increased from the prior quarter as capital generated from earnings combined with the benefit of lower rates on AOCI more than offset increased capital return and RWA growth as we supported our clients. As I just noted, we delivered on our goal to accelerate capital return in the third quarter with common share repurchases of $450 million, up from $200 million in the prior quarter and $100 million in Q1. But falling rate moves at the end of the quarter did create some unexpected excess capital. In total, we returned over $670 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, equivalent to a total payout ratio of almost 100%. As we look ahead, we are planning for another quarter of healthy capital return in Q4, which we would expect to be somewhat higher than this quarter, subject to market conditions and other factors. As such, we continue to expect the full-year payout ratio for 2024 to be comfortably in the 80% to 90% range as we aim to strike the right balance between our capital return goals and supporting our clients with our balance sheet. In summary, we're pleased with both our third quarter and year-to-date results, which continue to demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategy to drive sustainable business momentum while delivering positive fee and total operating leverage, excluding notable items, along with a significant return of capital to shareholders. With that, let me cover our improved full-year outlook, which is all on a year-on-year basis and ex notable basis. I would highlight that the outlook continues to have the potential for significant variability given the economic and political environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro assumptions, we're assuming global equity markets are flat to third quarter end for the remainder of the year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve, and we expect FX market volatility to remain relatively flat to third quarter average levels for the remainder of the year. Given our strong results year-to-date and higher average market levels, we now expect that total fee revenue will likely be at or slightly above the high end of our up 4% to 5% range, better than our prior expectations. Turning to NII, we now expect full-year NII will be up in the 4% to 5% range, which is also better than our previous guide for NII to be up slightly on a full-year basis. Finally, given these improved top-line revenue expectations, expenses are expected to be somewhat higher than our prior outlook and now up in the range of 3.5% this year, given higher revenue-related costs. Importantly, we continue to expect to deliver both positive fee and positive total operating leverage for the full year. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Thank you, Eric. To conclude, I'm pleased with how we have been able to deliver stronger financial performance so far this year. We entered 2024 expecting roughly 3% to 4% fee revenue growth together with positive fee operating leverage, while NII was expected to be a headwind to our financial results on a full-year basis. However, with successful execution against our strategic and client engagement priorities, together with a more constructive operating environment and strong balance sheet management, we now expect to notably outperform our outlook relative to where we started the year with higher fee revenue growth and NII comfortably up year-over-year. As a result, we expect to deliver both healthy positive fee and total operating leverage this year, excluding notable items. We are positioned for a strong finish to 2024 and we are confident as we look into next year. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks very much. I appreciate all that detail. I like the NII guide, and what that, I think, implies for next year. Can you talk about the management actions taken? You mentioned the five-year -- the five-quarter payback. I want to be blunt and say, does that mean you'll make at least the $81 million of that cost over the next five quarters? And then maybe a little more color on what within the book you actually restructured and offloaded? Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Glenn, it's Eric. You've interpreted that exactly correctly. The $80 million loss that was booked in the quarter will reverse out in the next -- within the next five quarters, and then, we'll have some, and it'll be a positive for the company. As we continue to manage the investment portfolio, we have north of $100 billion of assets. They range from treasuries, MBS securities to supranationals and foreign sovereigns. There were some securities that we felt were lower coupon that could be restructured or repositioned through a sale. We bought back some additional securities. In this particular set of actions, it was mostly in the treasury and international sovereign and supra space. It was $4 billion or $5 billion of securities on $100 billion book, so relatively modest. And it also allows us to just adjust the position of the book across the curve slightly, which was also beneficial. So, kind of, as I think you'd expect, but this will be helpful going forward and part of the management actions that we've been talking about as we manage NII. Some of those are around the investment portfolio, some of those are around lending growth, and some of those are around our engagement with clients on deposits as we've talked about in the past.\nGlenn Schorr: That's a nice parting gift. Thank you. Maybe one quick one. You mentioned in the SSGA conversation about the hybrid product with Apollo. I'm curious if you'd give us any bits in detail of how it will work and why you chose maybe 15% going to private credit. Is that enough to drive differentiated performance and scalability? Is this just like a toe in the water to see how this is going to be received?\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah, Glenn, it's Ron. We're in a quiet period now with the SEC, so we're really constrained about what we can say about this. But what I will say is, we've been -- much of our innovation in the past has been about how do you democratize access to more sophisticated clients and put them in structures that are broadly available. And what we're talking about here is consistent with that. We'll have a lot more to say about it after the SEC has completed its process.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay, cool. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS Financial. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And Eric, congrats on the new role. Big change in the multiples. Hope that doesn't create issues, give you the bends or something when you go up. So, curious about -- with Eric's departure, kind of bring succession to mind. So Ron, could you maybe update us on the latest on that front and what you can tell us about the Board's plan?\nRon O'Hanley: Are you referring to my succession, Brennan?\nBrennan Hawken: That's right. Yeah, overall.\nRon O'Hanley: So, as you would expect, succession is something that well-managed and well-overseen companies talk about all the time. And there's a near constant discussion about this at the Board and there's a plan in place for when that time comes.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay, great. And then, repo has been pretty solid. Clearly, you guys see some continued strength, hence, the updated NII outlook for the year. But could you tell us about how repo comes into play there into your expectations? And what we should think about the recent strength there?\nEric Aboaf: Glenn, it's Eric. The repo product is one of many that we offer for clients, right? We offer them cash on deposit in various forms. Money market sweep repo is a collateralized activity. So, in a way, think of it as one of the broad range of elements that we offer. What we found is as the Fed has trended down its reversed repo operation, there's been more repo activity in the market and we've obviously wanted to be there to help our clients. That said, the repo activity, the sponsored repo activity that we do is 10%, 11%, 12% of our NII typically. It will bounce around by 1 percentage point or 2 percentage point. This quarter, I called it out because I think we added about 1 percentage point of NII due to the increase in repo activity. And what you're working through is sometimes balances are up a bit, sometimes margins are up a bit, and we just found more activity in the market. There's more cash out there as you've seen. And there are also more borrowers who are looking for cash and have collateral to post. And those are markets where we're happy to serve our clients on both sides of that transaction and stepped in and stepped up for them.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thanks for that color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks. Eric, congrats to you as well. I guess, in that vein and the question for both of you guys, State Street has made some pretty meaningful progress improving profitability recently, but with the new CFO search underway, how durable do you think these profitability improvements are likely to be? So, like, in other words, how much of this is already in motion and sort of on the rails that can more seamlessly perhaps transition to whoever comes next? And what are your ultimate sort of aspirations for pre-tax margins for the firm as a whole over time?\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah, Alex, I'll start on that. I mean, we've been fairly transparent about what we've been doing across the board at the firm, both revenues and expenses. So, starting with our Investment Services business, I mean, we've talked a lot about what we've done to restore and regain and really distinguish ourselves in service quality, which in turn has enabled us to actually grow and restore the growth that we've had in the past. We talked a lot about some of the new sales and client service kinds of actions we have in place. That's all in motion. Is there more to do? For sure. But is the plan clear? Yes, it is. But we would expect to see continued benefits being derived from that. In GA, we've got a broad-based strategy and they're really aimed at how do we actually broaden the appeal and broaden the franchise beyond its traditional institutional core. We've talked a lot about what we've done in the retail area with the low-priced ETFs. Product innovation is occurring at a really breakneck clip there. We launched 20 new ETFs this year. We've talked about some of the new partnerships that we've had, which assuming we get through all the regulatory hurdles there, we're very optimistic about. And so, we feel like we've got that side covered in a pretty clear path. In the Markets business, the Markets client franchise largely overlaps with our Investment Services franchise, but that's not enough, right? You have to be able to distinguish yourself in there. And I think the progress that you're seeing over the past couple of quarters reflects some of the work that we've done there with more to come. I mean, this is a franchise that's based on innovation. And then finally, in terms of productivity, we've been talking to you about productivity and transformation since 2019. And every year, we go at it in a different way, typically a more sophisticated way each year. The early years are about what, I guess, we'd all describe as low-hanging fruit. These later years have been about fundamental operating model transformation, including a much more sophisticated application of technology. That's where a lot of our investment is going, but we see much more to do there. So, I wouldn't anticipate a new CFO signaling any kind of change in strategy. Now, it's not to say that it isn't a vitally important role and we're going to -- the search process is literally commencing today. We've already engaged a firm to help us. We'll look both inside and outside, but we're very confident coupled with the plan we have in place, four months of transition that we have with Eric, and just the overall performance of the firm that we're going to be in good shape through this transition.\nEric Aboaf: Alex, I'd also add, our medium-term targets stand as stated. They are deeply embedded in our culture, in our senior executive and management teams and with our Board. And so, the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, pre-tax margin target of 30%, those are there for the medium term purposely and topics and areas that we continue to strive for and deliver on.\nRon O'Hanley: And Alex, also, I'm glad Eric mentioned that. Also, it's part of our long-term incentives. It's the achievement, realization of those targets.\nAlex Blostein: Yeah, all makes sense. Just wanted to clarify that. So, for my follow-up, maybe quickly on NII, obviously, very nice update for the fourth quarter. Probably too early to talk about '25 with a lot of specificity. But as you sort of think about how the balance sheet is positioned, especially in the back of the recent securities repositioning you've talked about earlier today, how should we think about the sustainability and just durability of this kind of NII run rate over the next couple of quarters? I think, in the past, you talked about being a little more asset sensitive in Europe still, maybe a little bit more neutral in the U.S., but maybe help us with some broader framework of how to think about '25. Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, Alex, it's Eric. As you say, it's still early. We're operating through deposit levels, interest-bearing, noninterest-bearing, our portfolio composition, quarter by quarter by quarter. And so, we don't have additional information really to share regarding next year other than what we've said before, right? We've said that we continue for this past quarter and into the fourth quarter, expect some modest or slight amount of deposit rotation. That's a headwind. We've got the investment portfolio rolling through, but some quarters you get a bigger, smaller benefit just depending on the exact bond. And then, you've got lending activity. And then, you've got repo, as we talked about earlier on the call, bouncing up and down. We've said that it's really in the next few quarters, and I've used that language purposely, that we expect to see the stabilization of NII and then some growth from that level, but it's hard to pin exactly which quarter. But I think what you can do is if you open up the lens over one-year, three-year, five-year period, you can see where we've come from. You can see the zone that we're operating in. And I'll define the zone not as 1 percentage point difference, but the kind of a zone as you'd expected in a colloquial sense. But we're -- I think we're in a nice zone generally. It's helpful for our margin. And while the next few quarters we'll see some movement, we also see some stability and some growth thereafter.\nAlex Blostein: Got you. All right. Well, I think we'll get you for one more quarter after that. So, I'm sure that will be another topic yet again. So, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good afternoon.\nRon O'Hanley: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Eric, I'll miss you. Sorry to see you go. Good luck in the next role. And, I guess, my final question for you is just around how we should be thinking about the trajectory here of NII in an environment where maybe we get slower pace of cuts? Is that better for State Street?\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Betsy, for the question and for the thoughts. Yeah, I think, directionally, our balance sheet is relatively neutral. We have a slight asset sensitivity. And so, as rates come down, that has a slight impact to NII on a quarterly basis, but it's not dramatic. But given that direction or position, we'd have slightly better NII if rates didn't fall as quickly. I think our collective view here is rates will come down, but we've seen the market overshoot on the rate reductions. Our economists think that the terminal rate is likely to be subsequently higher than what it's been in the past. And so, I think, we're reasonably well positioned, and we'll absorb some of the central bank actions. And as we do that, we'll continue to build out our client lending activity, repo activity, our deposit engagement activity and so forth. And those will all contribute to stabilization of NII around this zone and then growth from there.\nBetsy Graseck: All right. Thanks so much. And then, Ron, one for you on -- I think, recently I saw a headline about State Street leaning into Mexico, and wanted to understand, is this a new effort or this is an expansion of existing business? And maybe just put it into context around your growth strategy, and are there other countries that you're looking to lean into? Thanks.\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah, Betsy, so we have a -- we certainly have a presence in Latin America. It's smaller than EMEA and APAC for us. But as you would expect, we tend to -- this is on the servicing, little bit in the markets area, but it's on the -- it really rise out of services. And as countries develop and as investment markets develop, that's the opportunity for us. And so, we are building out at a, I would say, moderate pace our capabilities and activity in Latin America, and what you saw there really reflected that. Our core markets, as you could imagine, remain the U.S., EMEA and APAC, but as you've seen from our growth over the past couple of years, it's -- we've had lots of growth in EMEA and APAC. More recently, we've gotten the growth rate in the U.S. kind of back on what had been traditionally. But as these markets grow, they start to need the same kind of capabilities that we've got in those developed markets, and also, in many cases, you have so-called emerging or developing markets that are really skipping over some of the milestones that developed markets had done in their development. So, again, it's an opportunity to bring some advanced technology and those kinds of things. But it's a modest investment. And we would expect over the short term, modest growth, but it's important to get the foothold there.\nBetsy Graseck: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good afternoon. And congrats, Eric, also. Maybe just taking on a comment that you mentioned Eric about putting more of your balance sheet to work to support clients, can you just go into a little bit more detail in terms of which areas? I assume you mean on the asset side and lending. And then, in conjunction with that, maybe if you can talk about deposit pricing strategies with your asset servicing clients in terms of either deposit beta or also supporting your clients in terms of the revenue model?\nEric Aboaf: Brian, sure. Let me cover those in -- one by one. On the asset side of the balance sheet, we've got a $300 billion balance sheet. We've got about $120 billion of risk-weighted assets. And as we think about capital deployment, it continues to be in three areas that we've historically supported our clients in, and we want to continue to expand. So, the first one is lending, as you mentioned. And we do everything from capital call financing to BDC lending, really an ecosystem of lending that we do for our private markets clients, our asset management clients and so forth. And there's real growth there for us, there's growth there for them. And what we find constructive is that, with many of those clients, if you support them with your balance sheet, they're that much more encouraged and likely to come to you for servicing activities, for asset management activities. And that's a very constructive and kind of virtuous circle of relationship that we and they benefit towards. So, lending is a very important part of what we do. Secondly, our trading activities in FX require a balance sheet. If we do more than just one, two, three month forwards and swaps, if we do options to support our clients, those require balance sheet. And again, we're happy to do that for our clients, especially for our substantial clients that we have large relationships with. And we'll do that around the world. So that's a good part. And then thirdly, it's really around the thirdly, it's really around the securities financing business, which has both an agency lending component where we're lending out of the box, but that requires some capital under the Basel III rules. And then, the prime services business, right, where we're lending out to those who are borrowers in the capital markets. And that's been an area of growth as well. So, those are the areas. The way we think about it is, we think of ourselves and we really act as relationship lenders, right? We lend not for itself, but we lend because it's to support our clients. It comes at good returns, but it comes as a way to deepen and broaden and expand the relationships that we have. So that's what we've been doing. We like to continue to do that. And the more we lend and support them across those different areas that I described, those three areas, the more growth we'll see both in NII and in the fee line. On the question of -- is that...\nBrian Bedell: Yeah, perfect. Actually, I can tie in the back half of that question with the second one, and that's just on the revenue -- on the fee revenue side of your new wins, particularly the Alpha products, I know -- the Alpha platform rather, and I know the private market initiatives as well. Should we be thinking of those as fee rate accretive or are you also flexible on pricing some of those with deposits as well on compensating balances?\nEric Aboaf: I'd say it's a little bit of both, to be honest. We have, for example, in the servicing fee area, we booked $330 million of wins on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to target $350 million to $400 million of fees. But it's obviously lumpy and a mandate sometimes pulls forward from a quarter, sometimes moves out a quarter. We'll see exactly where we land, but we are continuing to hone in on delivering substantial amounts of fee wins this year and have that target clearly in sight. As we do that, deposits are a part of the relationship, but more and more clients think of it both ways. They understand that there's a balance of trade. They understand that if they are pushing too much on one lever, then the other levers have to move in the opposite direction. On the other hand, there is real opportunity to work with clients to see how we can serve more and more of their needs. And what we found that as we've got that -- as we have those discussions, we end up doing more work with our clients and more support of our clients in more areas. And so, they tend to build and feed on each other as opposed to being offsetting.\nBrian Bedell: That's great color. Appreciate your detailed answers as always, Eric. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.\nJim Mitchell: Hey. Good afternoon. Hey, Eric, just on deposit behavior, after the rate cut, how did mix and volume growth look and pricing? Any thoughts on the initial reaction to the rate cuts in the deposit side?\nEric Aboaf: Jim, it's Eric. We really just saw more of what we've been seeing over the last few months. I don't think we saw any discernible change. Deposits in the system are generally been trending up 1 point or 1.5 point a quarter. That's across the banking system. You've seen our results are a little more of that. And we didn't really see a lot of changes. We continue just to see a market environment where there's a fair amount of cash in the system. Part of that is positioning. Part of that is, I think, carefulness on our investors -- that our investors have given the political and economic uncertainty. And so, the cuts didn't have a discernible impact on deposit levels. And in general, we think we're going to operate in and or around this level for the time being.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just pivoting to servicing fees, still a significant backlog, yet to be installed business in asset servicing. So, can you discuss how you're -- how quickly you expect that new business to be onboarded and how you're thinking about the quarterly trajectory from here?\nEric Aboaf: Yeah, the servicing backlog, we've enjoyed continuing to build. We, obviously, want to build it and deploy it, right? Both are important to our business system. And I think over time, it will continue to trend up somewhat and then get to a steady state level. Right now, as we look forward, we think about the installation of that backlog in two ways. On an AUC/A basis, we think about the installation coming in the next few years with somewhere between half to three-quarters of that coming through in the next year. And in terms of the servicing fee backlog itself, we roughly expect about half of that to come through over the course of the fourth quarter and all of next year, if you want to kind of rough it out and just think about the pace of installation. What that means is that we're always installing revenues from our backlog onto the balance sheet, right, or onto the -- into the P&L, I should say. And then, at the same time, our coverage and relationship force is out there winning new business. And there's business that then installs within three months, six months, nine months and 12 months. And so, over the -- every year, you'll see a mix. You'll see business that comes from a backlog that had a longer installation time period and then you'll have business that comes from within that fiscal year itself.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. Appreciate the help. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Ron. Hi, Eric. Congratulations, Eric, on the new position. Ron, you mentioned about the new business wins in the quarter. And I think you said $466 billion in assets under custody/administration. Can you share with us how much of that came from existing clients where you grabbed the bigger wallet share from those clients versus new customers? And second, were the wins primarily in the U.S., or were they outside the United States, Europe or Asia?\nRon O'Hanley: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Gerard. So, for this quarter, there was -- we had two Alpha wins, and the two Alpha wins dominate that AUC/A. It's just -- it's about $380 billion of the $460 billion is Alpha. And that's divided between U.S. and non-U.S., with a very, very significant global player in there that has a lot of U.S. presence. And what's interesting about both of them is -- both these wins is, they were existing, but in one case, we had a very, very modest service footprint with this institution. We were Charles River only with them. And as a result of this Alpha win, we will have a true front-to-back relationship with them, including importantly to move the asset servicing from a competitor to us. And with the asset -- excuse me, I'm sorry, moving the custody from a competitor to us. And with custody comes lots of opportunities to do things like deposits and foreign exchange and things like that. So -- and I think for years now as we've talked about the strategy and why this has been -- why we think it's important and why we think it gives us a competitive advantage. One of the reasons is just that, it's the opportunity to deepen relationships. And the other reason why it's so important is the flip side of taking long to install is that the business tends to be quite sticky because this is really -- it's much more analogous to enterprise outsourcing where the institution is actually making a choice of either, in most cases, moving from an insourced model to an outsourced model, and in some cases, moving from one outsourcer to another, but that doesn't happen quite as frequently. And as a result, because of the work that both parties are doing, we insist upon a longer contract period and the client itself understands these are very sophisticated buyers, understand that they're generational decision here, and so they want to get it right.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you for that color. And then, as a follow-up question, obviously, you guys are well-capitalized. You've been using your capital to support organic growth, as Eric pointed out, with lending, and you're paying obviously dividends and increasing them and buying back your stock. Alternatively, obviously, capital can be used for acquisitions. Can you give us an update on your appetite for acquisitions recognizing, of course, the Brown Brothers transaction did not work out the way you intended, but can you share with us your thoughts there as well?\nRon O'Hanley: Well, Gerard, we think about M&A not as a strategy, but as a way to implement our strategy either more rapidly or more efficiently. So, we'll always be paying attention to opportunities like that, but we see a lot of promise in the organic plans that we have developed and are now seeing the fruits of. So, our last significant acquisition, as you know, was Charles River that was done for important strategic reasons to enable the creation of the Alpha front-to-back platform. It was a dilutive acquisition, we knew that at the time, but we felt it was a very important long-term investment, and it's proven to be, but that's also costly and oftentimes disappointing to shareholders. So, we take our stewardship of capital responsibility very seriously, and we like what we're able to do on an organic basis or building on what we've done. So, not to say, we'll never do these things, but it's a high bar and it's got to be about -- as I said at the beginning of this answer, it's got to be really about accelerating the strategy and/or realizing the strategy more efficiently than we could organically.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Ron O'Hanley for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nRon O'Hanley: Thanks to all for joining us on the call. And just to emphasize, you get one more quarter of Eric. So, he'll be with us for the fourth quarter report in February and, basically, with us through mid-February -- in January and, basically, with us through mid-February. So, thank you all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results, which we released earlier this morning, demonstrate the accelerating financial performance and strong business momentum we are achieving this year, which in turn positions State Street well for future growth. We achieved robust fee and total revenue growth and generated positive fee and total operating leverage in 3Q, which, when combined with increased capital return quarter-on-quarter, drove strong earnings growth for our shareholders on both the year-over-year and sequential basis, with quarterly EPS reaching the highest on record. In addition to strong 3Q results, our year-to-date results also highlight the strength of our franchise and financial performance in three quarters of the way through the year, with solid fee and total revenue growth and good expense discipline driving better than expected positive fee and positive total operating leverage, as well as strong earnings growth relative to the same period in 2023 and excluding notable items. The operating environment in the third quarter was dynamic. While global equity and fixed income markets moved notably higher, the world's investors faced a number of risk-off events in 3Q, including fears of a U.S. recession, the unwinding of the carry trade, concerns over tech valuations and continued geopolitical tensions. These events drove bouts of negative market sentiment and significant market volatility. However, these market dislocations proved to be short lived with markets taking comfort from a host of subsequently dovish Central Bank pivots, including the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve in four years, as well as improved economic data in the U.S. We supported clients and navigated well through this market backdrop, delivering strong business and financial performance. We remain laser-focused on successfully executing against our key strategic priorities to drive better results, which I will now discuss. Turning to Slide 2 of our investor presentation, our third quarter EPS was $2.26 as compared to $1.25 in the year-ago period. Excluding notable items, we delivered strong earnings growth of 17% year-over-year with record quarterly EPS, while 3Q ROE was a strong 12%. Relative to the year-ago quarter and excluding notable items, fee and total revenue growth was robust at 7% and 9%, respectively, and in turn driving margin expansion. All areas of our business contributed to this year-over-year revenue growth and NII was significantly higher. Q3 servicing fees increased 3% year-over-year and we are pleased by the sales momentum we continue to see within the Investment Services business as we execute well against the sharpened strategy that we outlined last year. At the same time, expenses remained well-controlled despite increases in revenue-related costs. We continue to drive transformation and productivity savings, which are funding significant investments in our business this year. As a result, while 3Q expenses increased by 6% year-over-year, on a year-to-date basis, expenses increased by just 3%, excluding notable items relative to the same period in 2023. Turning to our business momentum, which you can see in the middle of the slide, we achieved a great deal in the third quarter. Our business performance indicators, including wins, clearly illustrate the effectiveness of our strategy and positioning State Street to support our clients, compete better and gain share. Within Investment Services, in 3Q, we generated strong AUC/A wins of $466 billion, with new servicing fee revenue wins of $84 million, the highest quarter this year. 3Q provided another clear demonstration of the power of State Street Alpha, which brings together the full depth and breadth of our servicing and software solutions. Alpha is a clear competitive advantage, which strategically positions us to retain business at even higher levels, win new long-term relationships, and, as evidenced this quarter, deepen existing relationships in a meaningful way. We reported two new Alpha mandates in 3Q, with Alpha accounting for the vast majority of our AUC/A wins this quarter, as State Street was awarded a significant mandate by a premier large global asset manager. This win illustrates the compelling value proposition of our front-to-back solution for clients. What started as a front-office Charles River client will now extend to include a host of middle- and back-office services, including custody, all underpinned by our Alpha Data Platform and Data Services. We are also very pleased with the momentum at Global Advisors this quarter. Our cash, ETF and institutional businesses all had positive net flows, including record quarterly flows in cash and strong ETF flows. In aggregate, quarterly total net flows of $100 billion and quarter-end assets under management of $4.7 trillion both reached record levels in 3Q. Importantly, we expanded our market share in a number of key product areas and geographies. For example, we improved our institutional money market fund rank this quarter, while Spider also gained share in both U.S. low cost and commodities, as well as in the EMEA region. We also continue to innovate and strategically expand Global Advisors' capabilities and client solutions. For example, Global Advisors launched 20 new ETFs in 3Q, including three actively-managed digital asset-focused ETFs. We also announced a new relationship with Apollo Global Management that will aim to expand investor access to private market opportunities. Turning to our Markets businesses, stronger client volumes in both FX trading services and securities finance helped to drive revenues higher, both sequentially and year-over-year. I was particularly pleased to see State Street named as a leader in the four categories by Euromoney Magazine in its 2024 FX Awards, including the world's Best FX Bank for Client Service as well as Research, which underscores the value clients place in our Markets franchise. Turning to our balance sheet, our year-over-year NII performance was strong, as a number of targeted management actions over the last year have helped to support NII growth. Our balance sheet is solid, enabling over $670 million of capital return in 3Q, including $450 million of share repurchases. As we look ahead, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders in the fourth quarter, subject to market conditions and other factors. Before I turn it over to Eric, we also announced this morning that Eric will be leaving State Street to pursue a new opportunity outside of banking. We have commenced a formal search process to identify his replacement, and Eric will stay on with us through mid-February to support us through this transition. I and the team have been fortunate to work closely with Eric over the last eight years. Personally, I have enjoyed and valued our partnership, and want to thank Eric for his leadership and wish him well in his new role. With that, let me hand the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Thank you, Eric. To conclude, I'm pleased with how we have been able to deliver stronger financial performance so far this year. We entered 2024 expecting roughly 3% to 4% fee revenue growth together with positive fee operating leverage, while NII was expected to be a headwind to our financial results on a full-year basis. However, with successful execution against our strategic and client engagement priorities, together with a more constructive operating environment and strong balance sheet management, we now expect to notably outperform our outlook relative to where we started the year with higher fee revenue growth and NII comfortably up year-over-year. As a result, we expect to deliver both healthy positive fee and total operating leverage this year, excluding notable items. We are positioned for a strong finish to 2024 and we are confident as we look into next year. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Yeah, Glenn, it's Ron. We're in a quiet period now with the SEC, so we're really constrained about what we can say about this. But what I will say is, we've been -- much of our innovation in the past has been about how do you democratize access to more sophisticated clients and put them in structures that are broadly available. And what we're talking about here is consistent with that. We'll have a lot more to say about it after the SEC has completed its process. Are you referring to my succession, Brennan? So, as you would expect, succession is something that well-managed and well-overseen companies talk about all the time. And there's a near constant discussion about this at the Board and there's a plan in place for when that time comes. Yeah, Alex, I'll start on that. I mean, we've been fairly transparent about what we've been doing across the board at the firm, both revenues and expenses. So, starting with our Investment Services business, I mean, we've talked a lot about what we've done to restore and regain and really distinguish ourselves in service quality, which in turn has enabled us to actually grow and restore the growth that we've had in the past. We talked a lot about some of the new sales and client service kinds of actions we have in place. That's all in motion. Is there more to do? For sure. But is the plan clear? Yes, it is. But we would expect to see continued benefits being derived from that. In GA, we've got a broad-based strategy and they're really aimed at how do we actually broaden the appeal and broaden the franchise beyond its traditional institutional core. We've talked a lot about what we've done in the retail area with the low-priced ETFs. Product innovation is occurring at a really breakneck clip there. We launched 20 new ETFs this year. We've talked about some of the new partnerships that we've had, which assuming we get through all the regulatory hurdles there, we're very optimistic about. And so, we feel like we've got that side covered in a pretty clear path. In the Markets business, the Markets client franchise largely overlaps with our Investment Services franchise, but that's not enough, right? You have to be able to distinguish yourself in there. And I think the progress that you're seeing over the past couple of quarters reflects some of the work that we've done there with more to come. I mean, this is a franchise that's based on innovation. And then finally, in terms of productivity, we've been talking to you about productivity and transformation since 2019. And every year, we go at it in a different way, typically a more sophisticated way each year. The early years are about what, I guess, we'd all describe as low-hanging fruit. These later years have been about fundamental operating model transformation, including a much more sophisticated application of technology. That's where a lot of our investment is going, but we see much more to do there. So, I wouldn't anticipate a new CFO signaling any kind of change in strategy. Now, it's not to say that it isn't a vitally important role and we're going to -- the search process is literally commencing today. We've already engaged a firm to help us. We'll look both inside and outside, but we're very confident coupled with the plan we have in place, four months of transition that we have with Eric, and just the overall performance of the firm that we're going to be in good shape through this transition. And Alex, also, I'm glad Eric mentioned that. Also, it's part of our long-term incentives. It's the achievement, realization of those targets. Hi, Betsy. Yeah, Betsy, so we have a -- we certainly have a presence in Latin America. It's smaller than EMEA and APAC for us. But as you would expect, we tend to -- this is on the servicing, little bit in the markets area, but it's on the -- it really rise out of services. And as countries develop and as investment markets develop, that's the opportunity for us. And so, we are building out at a, I would say, moderate pace our capabilities and activity in Latin America, and what you saw there really reflected that. Our core markets, as you could imagine, remain the U.S., EMEA and APAC, but as you've seen from our growth over the past couple of years, it's -- we've had lots of growth in EMEA and APAC. More recently, we've gotten the growth rate in the U.S. kind of back on what had been traditionally. But as these markets grow, they start to need the same kind of capabilities that we've got in those developed markets, and also, in many cases, you have so-called emerging or developing markets that are really skipping over some of the milestones that developed markets had done in their development. So, again, it's an opportunity to bring some advanced technology and those kinds of things. But it's a modest investment. And we would expect over the short term, modest growth, but it's important to get the foothold there. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Gerard. So, for this quarter, there was -- we had two Alpha wins, and the two Alpha wins dominate that AUC/A. It's just -- it's about $380 billion of the $460 billion is Alpha. And that's divided between U.S. and non-U.S., with a very, very significant global player in there that has a lot of U.S. presence. And what's interesting about both of them is -- both these wins is, they were existing, but in one case, we had a very, very modest service footprint with this institution. We were Charles River only with them. And as a result of this Alpha win, we will have a true front-to-back relationship with them, including importantly to move the asset servicing from a competitor to us. And with the asset -- excuse me, I'm sorry, moving the custody from a competitor to us. And with custody comes lots of opportunities to do things like deposits and foreign exchange and things like that. So -- and I think for years now as we've talked about the strategy and why this has been -- why we think it's important and why we think it gives us a competitive advantage. One of the reasons is just that, it's the opportunity to deepen relationships. And the other reason why it's so important is the flip side of taking long to install is that the business tends to be quite sticky because this is really -- it's much more analogous to enterprise outsourcing where the institution is actually making a choice of either, in most cases, moving from an insourced model to an outsourced model, and in some cases, moving from one outsourcer to another, but that doesn't happen quite as frequently. And as a result, because of the work that both parties are doing, we insist upon a longer contract period and the client itself understands these are very sophisticated buyers, understand that they're generational decision here, and so they want to get it right. Well, Gerard, we think about M&A not as a strategy, but as a way to implement our strategy either more rapidly or more efficiently. So, we'll always be paying attention to opportunities like that, but we see a lot of promise in the organic plans that we have developed and are now seeing the fruits of. So, our last significant acquisition, as you know, was Charles River that was done for important strategic reasons to enable the creation of the Alpha front-to-back platform. It was a dilutive acquisition, we knew that at the time, but we felt it was a very important long-term investment, and it's proven to be, but that's also costly and oftentimes disappointing to shareholders. So, we take our stewardship of capital responsibility very seriously, and we like what we're able to do on an organic basis or building on what we've done. So, not to say, we'll never do these things, but it's a high bar and it's got to be about -- as I said at the beginning of this answer, it's got to be really about accelerating the strategy and/or realizing the strategy more efficiently than we could organically. Thanks to all for joining us on the call. And just to emphasize, you get one more quarter of Eric. So, he'll be with us for the fourth quarter report in February and, basically, with us through mid-February -- in January and, basically, with us through mid-February. So, thank you all."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron. Before I get into the numbers, I want to say that it has been a privilege to have been here at State Street and to have worked with you and the team. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished together over the past eight years, and it's with mixed feelings that I'm moving on. But I know that the progress will continue and that State Street is well-positioned with a strong financial foundation and strategy for success. And I look forward to working with the team into 2025 during the transition. Now, let me walk everyone through our results for the third quarter. Starting on Slide 3, we reported record EPS of $2.26 for the third quarter, which included notable revenue items that, in aggregate, were neutral to earnings and are detailed on the right side of the page. You can see that we took the opportunity to do some additional repositioning of the investment portfolio this quarter, which I'll talk more about in a moment. We delivered robust EPS growth of 17% year-on-year, excluding notable items, reflecting broad-based fee growth, higher NII and continued capital return, which increased on a sequential quarter basis. Our third quarter performance builds upon our strong first half of the year, as healthy fee and total revenue growth coupled with expense discipline delivered both positive fee and positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items, in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. The quarter clearly demonstrates good margins and returns with pre-tax margin at almost 28.5% and ROE of 12% and a return on tangible common equity of over 19%. Turning now to Slide 4, the third quarter period-end AUC/A and AUM, again, increased to record levels, supported by both equity and bond market tailwinds as well as strong client flows. As you can see on the right panel of the slide, after an eventful third quarter, the various external indicators for our Markets businesses were mixed. That said, we were encouraged by the continued growth in client volumes and balances across our FX trading and securities finance businesses, which I'll discuss more in detail shortly. Turning to Slide 5, third quarter servicing fees increased 3% year-on-year, as higher average market levels and new business were partially offset by pricing headwinds and previously disclosed client transition and lower client activity, including an asset mix shift. The impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth, while lower client activity, including an asset mix shift into cash, was a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point to year-on-year growth, which seems to be abating somewhat. We do feel good about servicing fee momentum going into the fourth quarter. Encouragingly, we generated $84 million of revenue wins in the quarter, the majority of which were driven by back-office mandates, in line with our strategic focus. Over the past four quarters, we've achieved nearly $330 million of servicing fee revenue wins. Moving to Slide 6, third quarter management fees increased 10% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average market levels as well as record quarterly net flows, with positive inflows across all three major product lines. We gained market share within our cash business due to strong investment performance and expanded distribution, as well as in ETFs where our strategic repricing initiative contributed to the strong flow performance and continued ETF market share gains. Taken together, our Investment Management business demonstrated strong growth in the quarter while also generating a healthy pre-tax margin of approximately 30%, up over 2 percentage points year-on-year. Importantly, as Ron mentioned earlier, we continue to position Global Advisors for success by further expanding its capabilities and client solutions and meeting the evolving needs of investors in key growth areas, such as digital assets, private markets and innovative fixed income solutions. Now, turning to Slide 7, as I noted, this quarter, we are pleased to see continued growth in our Markets businesses with higher volumes across nearly all of our FX venues relative to the year-ago period. FX trading revenue increased 15% year-on-year, excluding notable items, driven by higher client volumes with particular strength in emerging markets. Securities finance revenues increased 13% year-on-year, reflecting higher agency lending balances and share gains with excellent performance in prime services as we put more balance sheet to work to support our clients. Moving on to software and processing fees, revenues were up 11% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher front-office software and data revenues associated with CRD, which is described in greater detail on the following slide. Turning to Slide 8, our third quarter front-office software revenues increased 12% year-on-year with our software-enabled and professional services revenues up a strong 21%. We are pleased with the robust growth we've consistently delivered in our software business, with revenues up 10% year-to-date. This level of growth supports our belief that our software business has the potential to reach $1 billion of revenue over the next five years. And as Ron noted, we reported two additional Alpha mandate wins in the quarter, and we remain confident in achieving our goal of winning six to eight new Alpha clients this year. Moving to Slide 9, third quarter NII increased 16% year-on-year to $723 million as higher investment security yields and higher loan growth more than offset continued deposit rotation. On a sequential basis, NII was 2% lower, primarily driven by continued deposit rotation, as well as by the impact of lower short-end rates stemming from Central Bank actions. This dynamic was partially offset by higher investment security yields, as well as additional lending and sponsored repo activity. The market dynamics for the sponsored repo product were constructive in the quarter. As detailed on the right panel of this slide, average investment portfolio balances increased both sequentially and year-on-year. We also opportunistically repositioned a small portion of the book late in the quarter, which has a payback of approximately five quarters, benefiting NII over the next two years. Average deposits increased 14% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter, as we continue to realize the benefits of our client engagement efforts. As we move into 4Q, we'd expect to generally operate around these levels, albeit with a bit of continued noninterest-bearing deposit rotation. Turning to Slide 10, year-on-year, third quarter expense growth was 6%, primarily driven by higher performance base instead of compensation and revenue-related costs, which were worth about half of the increase, as well as important investments in products, technology and infrastructure. We remain acutely focused on managing our cost base, as demonstrated by year-on-year expense growth of just 3% on a year-to-date basis, excluding notable items. As Ron mentioned, in the third quarter, we continued to deliver productivity benefits through transformation of our operating model and other savings initiatives, achieving roughly $125 million of year-on-year savings for a variety of actions. Year-to-date, we delivered roughly $350 million of savings, and we're on track to achieve our productivity savings target of $500 million this year. We're continuing to benefit from our ongoing organizational simplification. Process improvements and automation initiative, which has enabled us to further improve service quality while also lowering our headcount on a pro forma basis, including the JV consolidation by 4% year-on-year as detailed on the bottom left of the slide. Moving to Slide 11, as you can see, our capital, leverage and liquidity levels all remain very strong. As of quarter-end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.6% increased from the prior quarter as capital generated from earnings combined with the benefit of lower rates on AOCI more than offset increased capital return and RWA growth as we supported our clients. As I just noted, we delivered on our goal to accelerate capital return in the third quarter with common share repurchases of $450 million, up from $200 million in the prior quarter and $100 million in Q1. But falling rate moves at the end of the quarter did create some unexpected excess capital. In total, we returned over $670 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, equivalent to a total payout ratio of almost 100%. As we look ahead, we are planning for another quarter of healthy capital return in Q4, which we would expect to be somewhat higher than this quarter, subject to market conditions and other factors. As such, we continue to expect the full-year payout ratio for 2024 to be comfortably in the 80% to 90% range as we aim to strike the right balance between our capital return goals and supporting our clients with our balance sheet. In summary, we're pleased with both our third quarter and year-to-date results, which continue to demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategy to drive sustainable business momentum while delivering positive fee and total operating leverage, excluding notable items, along with a significant return of capital to shareholders. With that, let me cover our improved full-year outlook, which is all on a year-on-year basis and ex notable basis. I would highlight that the outlook continues to have the potential for significant variability given the economic and political environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro assumptions, we're assuming global equity markets are flat to third quarter end for the remainder of the year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve, and we expect FX market volatility to remain relatively flat to third quarter average levels for the remainder of the year. Given our strong results year-to-date and higher average market levels, we now expect that total fee revenue will likely be at or slightly above the high end of our up 4% to 5% range, better than our prior expectations. Turning to NII, we now expect full-year NII will be up in the 4% to 5% range, which is also better than our previous guide for NII to be up slightly on a full-year basis. Finally, given these improved top-line revenue expectations, expenses are expected to be somewhat higher than our prior outlook and now up in the range of 3.5% this year, given higher revenue-related costs. Importantly, we continue to expect to deliver both positive fee and positive total operating leverage for the full year. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Glenn, it's Eric. You've interpreted that exactly correctly. The $80 million loss that was booked in the quarter will reverse out in the next -- within the next five quarters, and then, we'll have some, and it'll be a positive for the company. As we continue to manage the investment portfolio, we have north of $100 billion of assets. They range from treasuries, MBS securities to supranationals and foreign sovereigns. There were some securities that we felt were lower coupon that could be restructured or repositioned through a sale. We bought back some additional securities. In this particular set of actions, it was mostly in the treasury and international sovereign and supra space. It was $4 billion or $5 billion of securities on $100 billion book, so relatively modest. And it also allows us to just adjust the position of the book across the curve slightly, which was also beneficial. So, kind of, as I think you'd expect, but this will be helpful going forward and part of the management actions that we've been talking about as we manage NII. Some of those are around the investment portfolio, some of those are around lending growth, and some of those are around our engagement with clients on deposits as we've talked about in the past. Glenn, it's Eric. The repo product is one of many that we offer for clients, right? We offer them cash on deposit in various forms. Money market sweep repo is a collateralized activity. So, in a way, think of it as one of the broad range of elements that we offer. What we found is as the Fed has trended down its reversed repo operation, there's been more repo activity in the market and we've obviously wanted to be there to help our clients. That said, the repo activity, the sponsored repo activity that we do is 10%, 11%, 12% of our NII typically. It will bounce around by 1 percentage point or 2 percentage point. This quarter, I called it out because I think we added about 1 percentage point of NII due to the increase in repo activity. And what you're working through is sometimes balances are up a bit, sometimes margins are up a bit, and we just found more activity in the market. There's more cash out there as you've seen. And there are also more borrowers who are looking for cash and have collateral to post. And those are markets where we're happy to serve our clients on both sides of that transaction and stepped in and stepped up for them. Alex, I'd also add, our medium-term targets stand as stated. They are deeply embedded in our culture, in our senior executive and management teams and with our Board. And so, the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, pre-tax margin target of 30%, those are there for the medium term purposely and topics and areas that we continue to strive for and deliver on. Yeah, Alex, it's Eric. As you say, it's still early. We're operating through deposit levels, interest-bearing, noninterest-bearing, our portfolio composition, quarter by quarter by quarter. And so, we don't have additional information really to share regarding next year other than what we've said before, right? We've said that we continue for this past quarter and into the fourth quarter, expect some modest or slight amount of deposit rotation. That's a headwind. We've got the investment portfolio rolling through, but some quarters you get a bigger, smaller benefit just depending on the exact bond. And then, you've got lending activity. And then, you've got repo, as we talked about earlier on the call, bouncing up and down. We've said that it's really in the next few quarters, and I've used that language purposely, that we expect to see the stabilization of NII and then some growth from that level, but it's hard to pin exactly which quarter. But I think what you can do is if you open up the lens over one-year, three-year, five-year period, you can see where we've come from. You can see the zone that we're operating in. And I'll define the zone not as 1 percentage point difference, but the kind of a zone as you'd expected in a colloquial sense. But we're -- I think we're in a nice zone generally. It's helpful for our margin. And while the next few quarters we'll see some movement, we also see some stability and some growth thereafter. Thank you, Betsy, for the question and for the thoughts. Yeah, I think, directionally, our balance sheet is relatively neutral. We have a slight asset sensitivity. And so, as rates come down, that has a slight impact to NII on a quarterly basis, but it's not dramatic. But given that direction or position, we'd have slightly better NII if rates didn't fall as quickly. I think our collective view here is rates will come down, but we've seen the market overshoot on the rate reductions. Our economists think that the terminal rate is likely to be subsequently higher than what it's been in the past. And so, I think, we're reasonably well positioned, and we'll absorb some of the central bank actions. And as we do that, we'll continue to build out our client lending activity, repo activity, our deposit engagement activity and so forth. And those will all contribute to stabilization of NII around this zone and then growth from there. Brian, sure. Let me cover those in -- one by one. On the asset side of the balance sheet, we've got a $300 billion balance sheet. We've got about $120 billion of risk-weighted assets. And as we think about capital deployment, it continues to be in three areas that we've historically supported our clients in, and we want to continue to expand. So, the first one is lending, as you mentioned. And we do everything from capital call financing to BDC lending, really an ecosystem of lending that we do for our private markets clients, our asset management clients and so forth. And there's real growth there for us, there's growth there for them. And what we find constructive is that, with many of those clients, if you support them with your balance sheet, they're that much more encouraged and likely to come to you for servicing activities, for asset management activities. And that's a very constructive and kind of virtuous circle of relationship that we and they benefit towards. So, lending is a very important part of what we do. Secondly, our trading activities in FX require a balance sheet. If we do more than just one, two, three month forwards and swaps, if we do options to support our clients, those require balance sheet. And again, we're happy to do that for our clients, especially for our substantial clients that we have large relationships with. And we'll do that around the world. So that's a good part. And then thirdly, it's really around the thirdly, it's really around the securities financing business, which has both an agency lending component where we're lending out of the box, but that requires some capital under the Basel III rules. And then, the prime services business, right, where we're lending out to those who are borrowers in the capital markets. And that's been an area of growth as well. So, those are the areas. The way we think about it is, we think of ourselves and we really act as relationship lenders, right? We lend not for itself, but we lend because it's to support our clients. It comes at good returns, but it comes as a way to deepen and broaden and expand the relationships that we have. So that's what we've been doing. We like to continue to do that. And the more we lend and support them across those different areas that I described, those three areas, the more growth we'll see both in NII and in the fee line. On the question of -- is that... I'd say it's a little bit of both, to be honest. We have, for example, in the servicing fee area, we booked $330 million of wins on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to target $350 million to $400 million of fees. But it's obviously lumpy and a mandate sometimes pulls forward from a quarter, sometimes moves out a quarter. We'll see exactly where we land, but we are continuing to hone in on delivering substantial amounts of fee wins this year and have that target clearly in sight. As we do that, deposits are a part of the relationship, but more and more clients think of it both ways. They understand that there's a balance of trade. They understand that if they are pushing too much on one lever, then the other levers have to move in the opposite direction. On the other hand, there is real opportunity to work with clients to see how we can serve more and more of their needs. And what we found that as we've got that -- as we have those discussions, we end up doing more work with our clients and more support of our clients in more areas. And so, they tend to build and feed on each other as opposed to being offsetting. Jim, it's Eric. We really just saw more of what we've been seeing over the last few months. I don't think we saw any discernible change. Deposits in the system are generally been trending up 1 point or 1.5 point a quarter. That's across the banking system. You've seen our results are a little more of that. And we didn't really see a lot of changes. We continue just to see a market environment where there's a fair amount of cash in the system. Part of that is positioning. Part of that is, I think, carefulness on our investors -- that our investors have given the political and economic uncertainty. And so, the cuts didn't have a discernible impact on deposit levels. And in general, we think we're going to operate in and or around this level for the time being. Yeah, the servicing backlog, we've enjoyed continuing to build. We, obviously, want to build it and deploy it, right? Both are important to our business system. And I think over time, it will continue to trend up somewhat and then get to a steady state level. Right now, as we look forward, we think about the installation of that backlog in two ways. On an AUC/A basis, we think about the installation coming in the next few years with somewhere between half to three-quarters of that coming through in the next year. And in terms of the servicing fee backlog itself, we roughly expect about half of that to come through over the course of the fourth quarter and all of next year, if you want to kind of rough it out and just think about the pace of installation. What that means is that we're always installing revenues from our backlog onto the balance sheet, right, or onto the -- into the P&L, I should say. And then, at the same time, our coverage and relationship force is out there winning new business. And there's business that then installs within three months, six months, nine months and 12 months. And so, over the -- every year, you'll see a mix. You'll see business that comes from a backlog that had a longer installation time period and then you'll have business that comes from within that fiscal year itself."

Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin today’s discussion, I want to acknowledge the assassination attempt on former President Trump. It was a horrible act of violence that has no place in our democracy and must be condemned. We are relieved that former President was not seriously harmed and we are saddened by the tragic loss of innocent lives and injury that resulted from this senseless action. Each victim was a participant in our democratic process, which makes this an act -- which makes us act an affront to all. We extend our thoughts and condolences to all those impacted. At this time, we hope for unity and respect in our country. Disagreement can and must sit along civility and a commitment to an even better America. Now turning to the second quarter. Earlier today, we released our financial results, which represented sustain momentum as we delivered good year-over-year fee and total revenue growth in both 2Q and for the first half of the year, along with continued expense discipline. This resulted in modest positive total operating leverage, pre-tax margin of almost 29% and a return on equity of nearly 12% in the quarter. We also continued to take important steps in the transformation and simplification of our operating model as we successfully consolidated our second operations joint venture in India in the quarter. These actions will enable State Street to continue to improve client experience and will unlock further productivity savings in the years ahead. In May, the transition to T+1 settlement was a significant event for global investors. Importantly, it presented State Street with an opportunity to demonstrate our position as an essential partner to our clients. Our role in successfully assisting clients through this transition reinforced our value to clients and underscored the depth of our operational capabilities. The financial market context in 2Q was mixed. While daily average global equity market levels continued to move higher and equity markets again reached new all-time highs in the second quarter, gains continued to be narrowly concentrated in a few names. Meanwhile, fixed income markets struggled in 2Q as geopolitical risks continued, economic data generally remained robust, and investors priced in a more gradual cycle of rate cuts, even as the ECB delivered its first rate cuts since the pandemic. For this market backdrop, we remain focused and successfully executed against our key strategic. Turning to Slide 2 of our investor presentation, I will review our 2Q highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, second quarter EPS was $2.15 as compared to $2.17 in the year-ago period. The durable nature of our business was evident in the quarter as year-over-year strength in management fees, FX trading and NII more than offset a previously disclosed client transition that negatively impacted servicing fee revenues, helping to drive revenue growth of 3%. We also remain focused on tightly managing our cost base, while continuing to make investments in our businesses, 2Q total expenses increased by less than 3% year-over-year, supported by our ongoing productivity efforts. Turning to our business momentum, while you can see -- which you can see in the middle of the page, we continue to execute well against our strategy, making progress in a number of key areas and to generating further fee revenue growth, which gives us confidence in our positioning as we look ahead. Within asset services, we generated AUC/A wins of $291 billion, which was well distributed regionally, and included more than $200 billion faster to install back office custody in line with our targeted sales strategy. Encouragingly, roughly a quarter of the AUC/A wins this quarter came from Alpha mandate in the APAC region. The win is a large new client for State Street covering a broad set of our services, including the back office. This mandate is another proof point that Alpha is an attractive client value proposition globally. Alpha creates a clear competitive advantage for State Street that strategically positions us to deepen existing client relationship and as demonstrated this quarter win new long-term client relationships in turn, helping to drive future growth. This ongoing new business performance coupled with an anticipated increase in installations positions us well for future servicing fee growth. Servicing fee revenue wins amounted to $72 million, up from $67 million in the first quarter. This is the fourth quarter in a row of strong servicing fee revenue wins totaling over $330 million over the last 12 months. Our pipeline is strong, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our increased servicing fee revenue sales goal of $350 million to $400 million this year. At Global Advisors, buoyed by higher average equity markets, 2Q management fees were $511 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year with AUM reaching a record $4.4 trillion at quarter end. While GA experienced aggregate net outflows in the quarter, it was largely driven by a limited number of client rebalancing. Encouragingly, we continue to make progress in a number of key strategic focus areas. For example, total net ETF inflows amounted to $6 billion benefited from continued market share expansion in U.S low cost equity ETFs. Regionally, we also saw spider gain market share in EMEA. Elsewhere, Global Advisors announced the planned strategic investment in Envestnet, a leading provider of integrated technology data and wealth solutions. This investment consistent with State Street's wealth services strategy, will enhance Global Advisors access to the independent wealth advisory and high-net-worth distribution channels driving future growth. NII performance was strong, driven by a number of targeted management actions over the last year to support NII growth. These include increased engagement with our clients to offer them financing -- financing and cash solutions, resulting in higher deposit, loan and sponsor repo balances, while we also carefully expanded our investment portfolio in 2Q. These actions have contributed to three quarters in a row of sequential NII and revenue growth, as well as positive total operating leverage in 2Q. Our balance sheet remains strong, enabling over $400 million of capital return in the second quarter, and over $700 million year-to-date. Our financial strength was evident with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test results in June. Subsequently and consistent with our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, we were pleased to announce our intention to increase State Street's quarterly common stock dividend by 10% to $0.76 per share, beginning in the third quarter, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. As we look ahead, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders this year, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, our strong start to the year continued in the second quarter. We delivered both fee and total revenue growth, which support in modest total operating leverage year-over-year, and a return on equity of nearly 12% in the quarter, all while continuing to make significant investments in our business, controlling expenses and returning capital to our shareholders. I am pleased with the progress we're making to drive better business momentum in sales performance as we execute against the sharpened revenue strategy. We recorded another Alpha mandate win in the quarter, which demonstrated the clear advantage that strategy brings to our organization by delivering a large and completely new client relationship to State Street. We already have good line of sight into 3Q and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our goals of 6 to 8 new Alpha clients, and $350 million to $400 million of servicing revenue -- fee revenue wins this year. And with that, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we reported EPS of $2.15 for the quarter as compared to $2.17 in the second quarter a year ago. EPS was slightly lower year-on-year, but would have been positive growth were it not for an $80 million reserve release last year. As Ron noted, we delivered 3% revenue growth year-over-year reflecting both higher net interest income up 6% as well as higher fee revenues up 2%, which supported modestly positive total operating leverage in the quarter. The second quarter strong performance contributed to an encouraging first half of the year, with both positive fee and positive total operating leverage on a year-to-date basis, excluding notable items relative to the prior year period. Turning now to Slide 4, period end AUC/A and AUM again increased record levels largely supported by market tailwinds. As you can see on the right panel of the slide, market indicators related to our trading business remain challenging in the quarter that we were pleased to see improved client volumes across our FX trading venues, which I will discuss shortly. Turning to Slide 5, servicing fees declined 2% year-on-year, as higher average equity market levels and net new business excluding our previously disclosed client transition were more than offset by pricing headwinds, and lower client activity and adjustments, including the asset mix shift into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. The impact of the previously disclosed client transition with a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth, while lower client activity and adjustments including the asset mix shift into cash was a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point on year on year growth. In addition, we saw the pace of quarterly installations track below expectations in 1Q and 2Q. We do, however, anticipate a pickup over the next few quarters as our higher level of recent sales begin to onboard. Sequentially, servicing fees were up 1% reflecting higher average equity market levels and client activity as transaction volumes tick back up and we saw clients start to put cash back to work. We generated $72 million of servicing fee revenue wins in 2Q and more than $330 million over the last four quarters, with the vast majority in back office, consistent with our strategy to prioritize faster installing custody mandates. At period end, we had $276 million of servicing fee revenues to be installed and $2.4 trillion of AUC/A to be installed. Moving to Slide 6, management fees were up 11% year-on-year primarily reflecting our higher average market levels and net inflows from prior periods, partially offset by the impact of our strategic ETF repricing initiative, which we believe is starting to pay off in both volumes and revenues. Sequentially, the benefit of higher average market levels was offset by net flows and lower performance fees. We are pleased with the steady growth we are delivering in Global Advisors. In the second quarter, we continue to expand the breadth of our offerings with the launch of new funds as we continue to broaden our product range in geographies. Our investment management business had healthy pre-tax margin of 32% in the second quarter, up 3 percentage points year-on-year and up 8 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. Now turning to Slide 7, as I noted, we saw a very nice uptick in client activity in our markets business with higher volumes across our major FX venues. This helped to drive FX trading revenue growth of 11% year-on-year, though volatility remained muted with compressed margin. Securities finance revenues also benefit from higher balances on both agency lending and prime services. However, our U.S Specials activity was subdued in the quarter which impacted margins and contributed to the year-on-year decline in securities finance revenues. Moving to software and processing fees, second quarter performance continued to benefit from strong client engagement with CRD. Though the cadence of on-premise renewals negatively impacted year-on-year performance which is shown in greater detail on the following slides. On Slide 8, as you can see, software enabled and professional services revenues increased 17% in the quarter. And we expect these revenues to represent a greater proportion of our front office software and data business over time as we transition another 20 clients from on-premise to more durable SaaS model over the last year. As we outlined in May, we believe our software business can be a significant revenue growth driver for State Street, potentially reaching a $1 billion in annual revenues over the next 5 years. In addition, we were pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in Alpha. We reported an additional Alpha mandate win and 2 mandates went live in 2Q, bringing the total number of live mandates to 23 at quarter end. As Ron mentioned, this quarter's Alpha win represents a brand new 10-year relationship with a large APAC client. We view long-term Alpha mandates like this are a key benefit of our differentiated Alpha strategy. Turning to Slide 9. NII was stronger-than-expected this quarter, up 6% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially to $735 million as higher investment portfolio yields and higher loan growth more than offset continued deposit mix shift in both periods. In addition, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, we proactively increased our investment portfolio balances at higher yields which benefited NII. Looking at the strong quarterly performance relative to our expectations in early June, we did see an inflow of valuable noninterest bearing deposits in mid June and again in late June as clients geared up for the holiday weekend, although I would note that we did see some reversal during the first week of July. Similarly, NII also benefited from higher interest bearing balances due to our client engagement efforts, as well as better spreads and volumes within our sponsored repo business as more clients join the program. Average deposits increased 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. We would expect to continue to operate at this higher level of deposit balances as we look to the back half of the year. Turning to Slide 10, year-on-year expense growth was contained to less than 3%. In the second quarter, we continue to invest in the business while also delivering productivity benefits in two key areas. The first is associated with our decision to consolidate two operations joint ventures in India late last year and this quarter. The year-on-year savings associated with these two JV consolidations are approximately $20 million in the quarter, excluding integration costs. Second, we benefited from our ongoing organizational process improvements and initiatives, including streamlining and delayering staff [ph] functions to increase our management's span of control, which enabled us to lower our headcount on a pro forma basis, including the JVs by 5 percentage points year-on-year as detailed on the bottom left of the slide. Together, these actions helped to drive down compensation benefit costs by 2% year-on-year in the second quarter, and facilitate our ability to reinvest in our franchise. The combination of the JV consolidations, along with our ongoing initiatives serves as a catalyst and importantly gives us confidence as we continue to deliver on our strategy to simplify our global operating model with meaningful benefits expected to build over time, including more productivity saves, as well as an ability to better serve our clients and invest for the future. Moving to Slide 11, as you can see, our capital levels remained strong and comfortably above the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.2% was slightly higher from the prior quarter, as capital generated from earnings was partially offset by continued dividends and share repurchases, as well as higher RWAs as we support our clients, which in turn drove higher fees and NII. We returned over $300 million in the first quarter to shareholders, followed by $400 million through common share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter, as we've tried to strike the right balance between our capital return goals and the support of our clients. Looking ahead to the back half of the year, we have announced the plan 10% per share quarterly common dividend increase on the heels of a strong performance on this year's CCAR starting in 3Q and subject to Board approval. In addition, our attention is to accelerate the pace of quarterly buybacks relative to the first half of the year. However, given the more modest level of repurchase activity so far this year, the full year payout ratio for 2024 will likely be closer to the 80% to 90% range, in line with our medium term targets. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results, which demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategy to drive sustained business momentum, while delivering positive total operating leverage excluding notable items. With that, let me cover our improved full year outlook, which I would highlight continues to have the potential for variability given the uncertain economic and political environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro assumptions, as we stand here today, we are assuming global equity markets are flattered to second quarter end for the remainder of the year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve as of quarter end, while we expect both FX market volatility and specials to remain needed. Given our strong start to the year and higher average market levels, we now expect that total fee revenue will likely be in the range of up 4% to 5% on a full year basis, somewhat better than our prior expectations for roughly 4% year-on-year growth. Turning to NII, given our 2Q performance, along with the continued benefit of management actions we have taken to support NII growth this year, we now expect full year NII will be up slightly year-over-year, which is also better than our previous guide of down roughly 5% on a full year basis. Finally, given these improved top line expectations, full year expenses are likely to be somewhat higher than our prior outlook of up 2.5% this year. We now expect expenses excluding notable items to be up about 3% this year, given the expected revenue related costs. Importantly, given this improved outlook, we now expect to deliver both positive fee operating leverage and positive total operating leverage for the full year excluding notable items. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Operator, we can open it up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks so much. Question on Global Advisors. You had some institutional lead outflows in the last two quarters, despite the strong markets. I'm just curious how much of that is a function of rebalancing? And are we supposed to expect more going forward given the strong equity markets? And are you seeing similar trends in your custody base? Thanks.\nRon O'Hanley: Hi, Glenn. It's Ron. You have it correct there. The most of it, the vast majority of it is around client rebalancing. In one case, an extremely large client that’s rebalancing away from certain act -- from certain asset classes. So it's idiosyncratic. We don't expect it to continue. And we feel very comfortable with the trajectory that Global Advisors is on both the institutional business and in ETF business.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Ron, what would have you -- there's been several articles over the last year or so talking about a certain European bank potentially selling their servicing platform. You've been linked to it as you should be. You've been great in consolidating things in the past. So I'm not asking you to comment on that, I am asking at some shareholders just preferred buybacks, which you might think is near-term. I'm curious on your thoughts conception on how you approach these things, if there were any lessons learned from the Brown Brothers Harriman saga [ph], and just conceptually how you're thinking about any consolidation opportunities and services. Thanks.\nRon O'Hanley: So, Glenn, I mean, we've been pretty consistent about this. We have a very, very strong market position. Now some of that, in the past has been built by M&A if you go back to the 2000s. But if you think about where we are now, it's very strong and the vast majority of our activity is around organic build out of our business. Some of that, just in terms of, focusing on clients within geographies, and some of that focused on building capabilities and extending them to other geographies. That is, by far the -- what our focus is. To the extent and I've said this in the past, I mean, M&A is not a strategy, but it can help us to effectively implement our strategy and it is superior to passes the test of being superior to a return of capital to shareholders, then we'll consider it. But our focus is on building out organically, returning capital to shareholders at a reasonable pace and continuing to accelerate what we do.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks, Ron.\nElizabeth Lynn: Operator, can we move to the next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. So great results on the NII and we heard the updated outlook for slightly up this year now. Eric, just wondering, that would still imply a lower second half versus this really strong second quarter. And I know there's a lot of uncertainty still out there in the environment. So can you just help us think through what are you contemplating in terms of how deposits track from here, and what caveats should we continue to think in mind if in fact, there is still second half comes off of this, the second quarter real strength? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Ken, its Eric. As you said, we're pleased with the second quarter results on NII. Some of that is the interest rate environment. But a good portion of that is the management actions we've been taking in terms of engaging with our clients on deposits. And really being there for them on both sides of the balance sheet, as we lend and support their growth as well. This quarter was particularly strong. We had a nice tailwind from long-term rates during the quarter that helped you saw us build out our investment portfolio a little more. Deposits ticked up second half of June and towards the end, especially noninterest bearing. But what I find pleasing is that deposits are coming in stronger across the -- what I will call the pricing stack, the transactional deposits, the exception price deposits and initiatives. So across the spectrum and that's really a testament to the engagement that we've had with our clients to be there. I think as we look forward into the third quarter and fourth quarter, we still see some of the headwinds and tailwinds that we've talked about, short-term rates seem like will start to trend down that'll be a little bit of a headwind. Deposits, we're still seeing some of that rotation from noninterest bearing to interest bearing that is slowing. That was -- that rotated out about $2 billion this past quarter and that's been less than the prior quarters. But that still continues and still a little bit of pricing and mix shift that we're seeing in the interest bearing deposit base. So that -- that we see is just playing out through the end of the year, but at a more modest pace. The offsets to that are mix of long-term rates, the lending, that we continue to do, lendings up double digits and that's been purposeful to support our clients and to support NII. And then, tactically adjusting the investment portfolio. And so it's the net of those that probably will come in with some erosion over the next couple of quarters. But we're seeing a place where deposits are come in at a nice and robust level on our balance sheet. Lending continues. And so, we're getting to a point where we're going to start to see I think an inflection of NII and a bottoming, which is nice. And we can see that over the next a few quarters. Hard to tell exactly when, but with the headwinds and tailwinds kind of I'll say equalizing over time, it gives us a good basis to look forward.\nKen Usdin: Okay, got it. And then one -- Ron, one question. You mentioned that you think that core fees growth should get better from here, and just wanted to ask you to deepen on that a little bit. I mean, I know that you've mentioned the onboarding and such, but we still have that deconversion working against, and you mentioned the episodic stuff in the ETF stuff. But like -- I think that's really people are looking for on the increment. So is that what drives that incrementally better fee guide for the second half? Is that we're finally going to see like those that servicing and management fee line start to show a better rate of change?\nRon O'Hanley: Yes. So there's -- I think you largely have it. But let me go a little bit deeper, Ken, because if you think about -- let's talk about core servicing fees, what really drives it? First is retention. Second is the amount and rate of onboarding. And then third is do business and sales, and then rinse and repeat. And our retention levels which they -- we've talked about them before and we're continuing to track well against them even coming a little bit higher than what we had planned. Second onboardings, as Eric noted, they've been slower than expected this year. But we see lots of visibility going forward to that increasing. We've got a big book there to onboard and that will start to onboard and -- it should start to onboard in accelerating rate. And then third is sales. And there's two things going on there. One, the amounts we opted in '23, we opted again in '24. We're on track for that increased servicing fee -- sales target. But we also have disproportionate focus on traditional back office fees, either standalone, or if they're associated with Alpha, making sure that when an Alpha assignment comes on board, the back office conversions occur first. And that's part of the learning this whole Alpha process. So that by itself gives us encouragement, and then -- and Eric will probably want to go into this a little bit more, the deconversion that seems like we talked about forever. I mean, we're hitting bottom right now in terms of that. So we'll start to see improvement on that as a comp and as its effect and move beyond it, starting in the next quarter or two. So that's servicing fees. And management fees, we are very encouraged by what we're seeing at SSJ. It's been -- it's part of a carefully crafted strategy, both in the institutional ETFs. We've talked about ETF flows, we've talked about market share and the very important low cost ETFs, which, in effect represent penetration into the retail market, all that is working well. And then finally, we had this historically low volatility in FX. Nonetheless, the team has been highly focused on continuing to build share within our clients to move up on the panels. And [indiscernible] saw some of that pay off in terms of FX in securities finance. Again, there's been a new strategy in place there and some progress there. So this is much of what we do is a game of inches. But there's a lot of inches coming together here that we feel quite good about.\nKen Usdin: Great. Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I would like to start with euro deposits, the ECB cut rates this quarter. So I'm curious to hear I know, a euro I believe is your second biggest currency in your deposit base. So curious about what impact that you saw from that cut? Where was the beta on that cut? And was it roughly equivalent to the beta [ph] as you saw on the final increases? And based on that experience, how does that inform your expectation for only see cuts in the fed funds.\nEric Aboaf: Brennan, it's Eric. It's nice to see the industry environment top out and begin to reverse, though I think it'll reverse slowly. We've seen the beginning of that and feels like it'll take some time, which is -- which will be fine because remember, our portfolio and our balance sheet is roughly neutral and relatively insulated now from interest rate increases or decreases. We have a slight sensitivity across the balance sheet, but it's light. It's -- if all central banks across the curve cut rates by 25 basis points, we're talking about $5 million per quarter impact on a $2.5 billion base of a full year NII. So that's the -- we're talking about small effects. To your point euro is a good place to start because euro rates increased lagged on the way up and now are starting to move in the opposite direction. We have said, and the euro experience on this first rate move has demonstrated that we expect largely to see symmetry in the betas. So as we -- as rates rose, we lagged and then the betas increased over time towards the back end of the rate cycle. And what we've said is, area by area transaction rate deposits, exception rate deposits, and the initial rate deposits, will tend to see the reversal of that. And so, specifically in euros, we did see that. We -- the beta and the first tick down was similar to the beta on the last tick up and I think is a good representation largely of what we expect to see. And that means that, if you step back even further, we feel like our pricing is set at a healthy level. We have a range of pricing and pools of deposits, and in a way have built real engagement with our clients. So they understood the model as floated up. And similarly they understand the model as rates floated down in the balance of trade, and it comes together nicely.\nBrennan Hawken: Got it. Thanks for that. Thanks for that. I appreciate it. On thinking about another factor that has been a bit more robust recently repo has been pretty strong in recent quarters. Do you think based on what's been happening in the marketplace, that strength is sustainable? And it seems as though the NII story is playing out better than you had originally anticipated, obvious given you brought up guidance, but is that another x factor that could allow for the back half of the year to maybe see less of a pronounced step down, then your improved guidance seems to continue to embed?\nEric Aboaf: Brennan, it's Eric again. There's been a lot of talks about repo. Now we're saying that most of the NII we earn on our balance sheet is really based on deposit funding and lending. So 90% of our NII is around deposits, loans, investment portfolio. We're talking about 10%, which is on repo. So just for context and it is true repo NII came in a little bit better-than-expected in the second quarter, why? Because there was some dislocation in overnight repo operation of the Fed relative to SOFR. So clients came our way. We also saw dealer balance sheet strain, but the higher than expectation was in the $5 million to $10 million range. It's not a -- it was nice to take. And it was nice to be there for our clients. But in fact, repo has been relatively flat to actually, down a smidge over the last couple of quarters. And that's because it tends to be a thinner margin, but a useful way to accommodate our clients. And we think it's not going to be a large driver of the coming NII. It's fully included in our guide. I think the real big moving parts are really around deposits loans and then followed by investment portfolio and the mix of long and short rates that we'll see.\nBrennan Hawken: Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Your line is open.\nJames Mitchell: Hey, good morning. Eric, maybe just following up a little bit on the NII story, you talk about potentially an inflection coming. Can you discuss maybe the timing of that? And then when I look at your asset yields, the HTM book is still weighing that down. Can you talk about maybe the pace of maturity on that HTM book that's yielding a little over 2%? And how much -- how long it takes to kind of get that back -- coming back in? Is that a big part of your inflection story next year? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Jim, it's Eric. Calling a -- an inflection or a turn in NII is one of the hardest things to do. And so we've been -- our outlook is that in the next few quarters, we'll begin to see that, but we'll first go from the trends that we're seeing to a stabilization, it'll bounce around some, and then over time tick upwards. The factors are multifaceted. And with a number of ins and outs, you're right, the investment portfolios turning over, it turned over quite a bit in the second half of last year, it's now turning over by about 3, maybe $3 billion to $4 billion a quarter, and that's across HTM and AFS. And because there are some longer dated bonds in HTM, those roll through a little more slowly. But in a way that we have is a sustained amount of, I'll say, tailwind that comes with that because remember the roll-ons in the portfolio versus the roll-offs, those are worth a solid 250 basis point of spread differential. And that'll play through the books as a nice tailwind, assuming long rate stay, somewhere in the area, and we -- and the primary change on the curve is at the front end. So, I think it'll be a component. Right now the biggest component is really the deposit mix pricing levels of noninterest bearing, that's what's moving the needle the most. I mean, all these factors matter. And I think as the deposits stabilize, and we've started to see total deposit levels stabilize last few quarters, we have to see now the mix stabilize. Once that happens, the natural benefit from the investment portfolio rolling through, right, and then the growth in loans, and you've seen us lean into lending. Lending is up more than 10% year-on-year, because we're trying to be out there for our clients. And as we lend to our clients, they actually often do additional servicing business with us. That factor in the investment portfolio and the long-term rates will then turn to a net positive impact on NII in the coming quarters.\nJames Mitchell: Okay. That's really helpful. And maybe just to your point on deposit growth being a key driver, now that we're looking at rate cuts, Q2 [ph] is less. Do you feel like rate cuts can be a catalyst for growth based on historical experience? How do you think about getting back to kind of more normal growth levels in deposits? What do we need to say?\nEric Aboaf: I think the direct answer is that the rate environment has moved around quite a bit. And we've seen the deposit effects from the rate environment. I think those are relatively been -- those have been telegraphed through the banking system. And we've also seen the Fed balance sheet actions as they've been tightening conditions with their balance sheet, although that slowing and the overnight reverse repo operation is an easing, we've seen that telegraphed through. So I think the exogenous factors that have driven deposits over the last 2 years have largely been telegraphed. And the modest number of interest rate cuts, I don't expect to have that much of an impact on deposit levels. We'll see, but that's our kind of sense from talking with our clients and analyzing the vast array of data that we have. What we feel will make the difference over time is sales. So we talk a lot about servicing fee sales, targeting $350 million to $400 million this year, that's up from $300 million the year before and even less than the year before that. And with a tilt towards custody and remember, it's the custodial activity, not just the accounting or the middle office, but the custodial activity that brings with it balances, deposit balances, because they're needed as part of the, the buffer or the -- to handle the transactional activities that we process for clients. And so as we look forward, as sales continue to accelerate, and then we onboard those sales because both have to happen. That's what we expect will bring on additional deposits in a way are part of our organic growth model, which will bring fee growth, but also bring deposit growth and thus NII into the system at a -- I think at a nice rate, and it'll be year by year by year that that'll help drive growth.\nJames Mitchell: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks. Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck: Oh, hi. Good morning.\nRon O'Hanley: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I did just want to key off of the last comment around the sales. And to your point $350 million to $400 million is the goal for this year. Obviously, on Page 5, you show us what the rev wins are for 1Q and 2Q, 67 and 72. So that leaves us with an expectation that you're going to be able to bump that up pretty aggressively towards the 105 level for each of 3Q and 4Q. And so it gets to my question of what gives you the confidence in that? Is that a function of these are already sales that are in contract, and it's just the installation of the new wins that hits this page. And so that gives you a lot of confidence that you can generate that 105 level in each of the next two quarters.\nRon O'Hanley: Betsy, its Ron. Let me take that. Firstly, just to clarify that the these numbers that we're talking about are sales and not installs, right.\nBetsy Graseck: Right.\nRon O'Hanley: So, it wouldn't include anything that's under contract and subject to onboarding at this point. But what -- I mean, I think the way to think about it is, is this, that if you -- that's why Eric gave the four quarter number there. Third and fourth quarter historically for us tend to be a little bit better. Second half of the year is a little bit better than the first half of the year. So that's point number one. Point number two, the pipeline and we feel pretty good about the pipeline. So that's why we're continuing to affirm confidence in that target that we have of $350 million to $400 million.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Perfect. Yes, and I can see in last year, the second half was 3x 2Q. So, history, obviously shows that that should happen. So that's great. Okay, so then the follow-up …\nRon O'Hanley: But, Betsy, let me clarify the first part of my message, because I was not clear there.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay.\nRon O'Hanley: The number would include things that are in contract, but not include anything that's actually been on boarded. So when you see the to be onboarded number that we have out there, that includes basically past sales. So I hope that's clear. I didn't mean to confuse that.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. And then the follow-up just on the buyback. I understand you've got the opportunity for increasing buybacks and I'm expecting that you're going to be flexing that versus your SLR [ph] constraint is that fair? And with SLR at 6.3 and the minimum is 5, that feels like you've got a lot of room. So just want to understand how you're thinking about what the -- what level of SLR you want to hold regulatory minimum is 5, what kind of buffer should we expect that you're anticipating holding on top of that, just as we're working through our models on how much buybacks we estimate for you. Thank you.\nEric Aboaf: Betsy, it's Eric. Let me take that. As we had said and you're reflecting on buybacks were lighter, in first quarter at $100 million than we booked $200 million in second quarter, we expect that pace to accelerate into the third quarter and then again into the fourth quarter. So that's our intention and we have a good amount of room and capital generation each quarter to be able to deliver on that. In terms of the constraints, the ratio constraints, the most important one for us, and I think for our various stakeholders is the CET1 ratio. And that were -- I think we can continue to operate at a good pace, at a good level, but also that allows us a good pace of accelerating buybacks. The Tier 1 leverage or the supplementary leverage ratio are informative, but actually relatively manageable, right, with the right level of preferred equity we could -- we can operate where we need to. I think we've been clear on Tier 1 leverage what our range is, and we'll operate within that range. And we can adjust the preferred equity stack as necessary. We've not really formalized at least externally a supplementary leverage ratio range, but it -- I'd say, it kind of flows the -- in a similar way as the Tier 1 leverage and you can think of those as related from a conceptual and operational standpoint, and both of them are eminently manageable and are not really the constraint when it comes to common share buybacks.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. Okay. That's great. And then when we're thinking about the pace in accelerating from here, is that total dollars? Or is that the pace of up a 100 Q-on-Q? How should we think about which pace you're talking about?\nEric Aboaf: It's when we talk buybacks, there's always the -- it depends on market conditions and the environment and so forth. So we always want to be careful with that. And you'd expect that of us as well, Ron and a management team, that's both careful, but also leans into capital return. And you've seen our commitment, I think, we'd certainly -- we certainly feel the $100 million in the first quarter, it was below what we would have liked to deliver. We feel the $200 million was below what we would have liked to deliver. So I think there's a solid increase coming. You can think about it in dollar terms, two points, begin to create a line but that could be a curve as well. And I think you've got enough to go on. I think you've got …\nBetsy Graseck: Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.\nEric Aboaf: … you’ve got enough to go on.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes, I appreciate and I appreciate the conceptual chart. Thanks so much.\nEric Aboaf: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMike Mayo: Hi.\nRon O'Hanley: Hi, Mike.\nMike Mayo: I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying and not read too much into it. But I think what you're saying is over the next two quarters, you should be pretty much done with the NII declines. You’re pretty much done with the management [indiscernible] and deposit declines. And you should be pretty much done with the decommission of the major client. Am I reading too much into that? Or did I hear that correctly?\nEric Aboaf: Mike, it's Eric. With regard to NII and noninterest bearing deposits, I said the next few quarters. So, I'm giving myself a little bit of room to be honest, because it's hard to predict perfectly. And so I'll stick with a few quarters. I think that kind of works and that certainly covers your range, and maybe a little bit more. So, we just want to live through this. But we can see I think over the horizon here in a way and that's what we wanted to communicate. On the client deconversion, if you recall, we said this would be the largest year on a year-on-year basis. It was originally worth about 2 percentage points of total fees. We said about a percentage point year-on-year this year, half a point year-on-year last year, and about half a point year-on-year next year. So by the end of this year, we'll be through, I'll call it, three quarters of the effect, but they'll still be a piece of that coming through next year, and then it'll be behind us.\nMike Mayo: And you also mentioned continuing pricing pressure, which we've talked about -- for about 30 years, which is nothing new. But you did highlight pricing pressure. So in what context are you referring to? I imagine like your new win in APAC -- I assume spreads are better in Asia and outside the U.S -- in the U.S. So you talked about pricing pressure. Where are you seeing it?\nEric Aboaf: Mike, it's Eric again. I think we talked about pricing pressure because just part of the natural course of events, right, we get a market, we get pricing increasing -- increases from market upticks. And then with clients they ask for a part of that back. That's just how the business has operated, as you say, for the last 30 years. This quarter and last quarter and this year, and for the rest of the year, we expect pricing headwinds to be in line with the previous years and guidance. We've said pricing headwinds of about 2% per year. We're not seeing any more or any less of that. It tends to be a little more geared towards the asset manager segment, because those are the -- that is the group of clients that has mutual funds and some mutual fund versus ETF shifting. But it's not -- we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary or anything that is unexpected at this point.\nMike Mayo: And then one last one to follow-up on that. I mean, I guess maybe as goes your clients, as goes any company or as goes [indiscernible] and with the record high stock markets and historically such a strong position with the mutual fund, which you just mentioned, are you seeing that uptick? Or is it still a slog for your big long only asset managers that are your legacy strength?\nRon O'Hanley: Mike, it's Ron. Let me take that. I mean, I think that the -- as you would know as well as anybody, the business continues to change. And we've seen the continued move from the mutual fund to the ETF to the FMA. But you're also seeing these firms, particularly the well managed ones respond, and they're responding in a couple of ways. I mean, one new product types are -- I mean, even the most traditional mutual fund companies now have pretty interesting ETF lines. Most of -- they're involved in the DC 401(k) business, they've got a mutual fund offering, but they've got a collective trust offering too. So they're responding to that market pressure. Most of them are figuring out ways to participate in the wealth business, and we continue to respond and support them in that. So the nature of the business is changing. In some cases, some things were more lucrative than others. And so what you're also finding in those businesses, they're very focused on their cost base. Their technology stack, their operating stack, and again, that presses in our favor as we think about the Alpha front to back solution, we are the largest middle office provider by far in the industry and we've gotten quite good at that. So the -- we describe ourselves as an essential partner to our clients, and I think that plays through both in supporting them in their revenue and product activities as well as their cost and operations.\nMike Mayo: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, Thanks. Eric, I just have a quick follow-up trying to understand your NII guidance. Now look at your U.S interest bearing deposit costs, linked quarter they actually declined. Did you actually start cutting rates, or was there something else that drove that? Can you give some color on that? Is that likely to continue?\nEric Aboaf: Vivek, it's Eric. It's -- I would describe that as just part of the normal volatility that we'll see in deposits. I mean we run such a large franchise and our clients transactional activity tends to vary over time. But we're seeing healthy levels of deposits across dollars, across euros. And so we didn't -- we haven't seen anything, particularly surprising in one area or another. I think, total U.S interest bearing deposits, if you look at our addendum are up slightly, euros are up slightly and so on and so forth. So -- and to the extent that there are some movements, not driven by our pricing actions, per se. In truth, clients need a certain amount of transactional deposits to fund their custody accounts. And the pricing tends to be something that we have negotiated and is well understood now, given where we are in the cycle and isn't the determinant [ph] of the of movements at this point.\nVivek Juneja: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, guys. Ron, you mentioned in one of your answers about the servicing and management fees, that foreign exchange activity, the volatility was actually quite low relative to history. Can you share with us what drove that? And then second, what macro factors should we keep an eye on to see to drive that volatility higher as we go forward, especially in view of the geopolitical environment we're all living in?\nRon O'Hanley: Well, I'll start, but Eric, [indiscernible]. But I think if -- what caused it, I mean, there's been really remarkably low dollar volatility. And I think some of the things that have been driving that: one is just the simple strength of the dollar for an awfully long time. And it's almost become too dangerous of thing to bet against the dollar. And so, even in times where you would expect to see some volatility, we simply haven't -- we haven't seen that. So I think that's been the primary driver that you've got this inordinate strength of the dollar. But Eric, [indiscernible] over to you.\nEric Aboaf: Gerard, I think, to add to that, maybe in two ways. The dollar has been strong and continues to be the dominant currency globally for whether it's petrol, whether it's for core commodities, and the currency of choice. And what we've seen ebbs and flows in potential substitution euros, yuan [ph], et cetera, none of that is really come to pass. And so you have a bit of a stabilizing factor. I think the other thing that we've seen recently is because of the clients have been underweight -- I'm sorry, overweight in cash and underweight in equities and bonds, and they've started to put more of that cash to work, they're doing that both in the U.S and abroad and internationally. And as a result, there's not -- we're not seeing a lot of speculation in currency markets. We're seeing more, okay, I'll describe it as natural and transitional flows. And so we've not seen disruptions on one hand, knock on wood. And on the other hand, we have seen consistent holding of dollars and consistent buying of other currencies. And so, that's created -- it feels like a set of muted volatility levels that are fine for our clients. And our point of view is we need to serve clients during those times. And the more we can offer them ways to trade through us, through our multiple venues, some of them are platforms, some of them are single dealers, some are multi dealer, and then some of them are algos, we'll continue to do that and we'll support them and that'll because of the higher volumes we are seeing notwithstanding the lower volatilities has been fruitful and help drive revenue growth for us on that -- in that area.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you for that color. And circling back, you both touched on onboarding was slower-than-expected in the first half of the year, but you're expected to pick up as we go forward. What cause the slower-than-expected onboarding in the earlier part of this year?\nRon O'Hanley: Eric, it's Ron. Excuse, Gerard, it's Ron. I'll take that. It's concentrated in some large clients that also happened to be development partners. And I think we've talked about this concept of development partners, these are early partners that joined us in this journey, and we're doing a fair amount of development around that. So that's caused some of it. And then some of that has been idiosyncratic to those same institutions in terms of things going on in their own operation that have delayed some of -- delayed some of the onboarding. So that's been a big part of it. The second thing that's been driving is been really around private markets. While we've continued to bring on clients, and we're really pleased with our offering and the clients that we brought on, [indiscernible] slowdown in private markets is actually affecting us because we start to get paid right when the fund starts to draw capital [indiscernible]. And if you've been following this, many of the new funds that have been raised, including some of the very, very largest ones actually haven't drawn capital. So we've got a quote set up and ready to go. But we're not actually deriving meaningful revenues from that yet. So that would be the other major factor that's going on here.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ron, please continue.\nRon O'Hanley: Well, thanks, everybody for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ron O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin today's discussion, I want to acknowledge the assassination attempt on former President Trump. It was a horrible act of violence that has no place in our democracy and must be condemned. We are relieved that former President was not seriously harmed and we are saddened by the tragic loss of innocent lives and injury that resulted from this senseless action. Each victim was a participant in our democratic process, which makes this an act -- which makes us act an affront to all. We extend our thoughts and condolences to all those impacted. At this time, we hope for unity and respect in our country. Disagreement can and must sit along civility and a commitment to an even better America. Now turning to the second quarter. Earlier today, we released our financial results, which represented sustain momentum as we delivered good year-over-year fee and total revenue growth in both 2Q and for the first half of the year, along with continued expense discipline. This resulted in modest positive total operating leverage, pre-tax margin of almost 29% and a return on equity of nearly 12% in the quarter. We also continued to take important steps in the transformation and simplification of our operating model as we successfully consolidated our second operations joint venture in India in the quarter. These actions will enable State Street to continue to improve client experience and will unlock further productivity savings in the years ahead. In May, the transition to T+1 settlement was a significant event for global investors. Importantly, it presented State Street with an opportunity to demonstrate our position as an essential partner to our clients. Our role in successfully assisting clients through this transition reinforced our value to clients and underscored the depth of our operational capabilities. The financial market context in 2Q was mixed. While daily average global equity market levels continued to move higher and equity markets again reached new all-time highs in the second quarter, gains continued to be narrowly concentrated in a few names. Meanwhile, fixed income markets struggled in 2Q as geopolitical risks continued, economic data generally remained robust, and investors priced in a more gradual cycle of rate cuts, even as the ECB delivered its first rate cuts since the pandemic. For this market backdrop, we remain focused and successfully executed against our key strategic. Turning to Slide 2 of our investor presentation, I will review our 2Q highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, second quarter EPS was $2.15 as compared to $2.17 in the year-ago period. The durable nature of our business was evident in the quarter as year-over-year strength in management fees, FX trading and NII more than offset a previously disclosed client transition that negatively impacted servicing fee revenues, helping to drive revenue growth of 3%. We also remain focused on tightly managing our cost base, while continuing to make investments in our businesses, 2Q total expenses increased by less than 3% year-over-year, supported by our ongoing productivity efforts. Turning to our business momentum, while you can see -- which you can see in the middle of the page, we continue to execute well against our strategy, making progress in a number of key areas and to generating further fee revenue growth, which gives us confidence in our positioning as we look ahead. Within asset services, we generated AUC/A wins of $291 billion, which was well distributed regionally, and included more than $200 billion faster to install back office custody in line with our targeted sales strategy. Encouragingly, roughly a quarter of the AUC/A wins this quarter came from Alpha mandate in the APAC region. The win is a large new client for State Street covering a broad set of our services, including the back office. This mandate is another proof point that Alpha is an attractive client value proposition globally. Alpha creates a clear competitive advantage for State Street that strategically positions us to deepen existing client relationship and as demonstrated this quarter win new long-term client relationships in turn, helping to drive future growth. This ongoing new business performance coupled with an anticipated increase in installations positions us well for future servicing fee growth. Servicing fee revenue wins amounted to $72 million, up from $67 million in the first quarter. This is the fourth quarter in a row of strong servicing fee revenue wins totaling over $330 million over the last 12 months. Our pipeline is strong, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our increased servicing fee revenue sales goal of $350 million to $400 million this year. At Global Advisors, buoyed by higher average equity markets, 2Q management fees were $511 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year with AUM reaching a record $4.4 trillion at quarter end. While GA experienced aggregate net outflows in the quarter, it was largely driven by a limited number of client rebalancing. Encouragingly, we continue to make progress in a number of key strategic focus areas. For example, total net ETF inflows amounted to $6 billion benefited from continued market share expansion in U.S low cost equity ETFs. Regionally, we also saw spider gain market share in EMEA. Elsewhere, Global Advisors announced the planned strategic investment in Envestnet, a leading provider of integrated technology data and wealth solutions. This investment consistent with State Street's wealth services strategy, will enhance Global Advisors access to the independent wealth advisory and high-net-worth distribution channels driving future growth. NII performance was strong, driven by a number of targeted management actions over the last year to support NII growth. These include increased engagement with our clients to offer them financing -- financing and cash solutions, resulting in higher deposit, loan and sponsor repo balances, while we also carefully expanded our investment portfolio in 2Q. These actions have contributed to three quarters in a row of sequential NII and revenue growth, as well as positive total operating leverage in 2Q. Our balance sheet remains strong, enabling over $400 million of capital return in the second quarter, and over $700 million year-to-date. Our financial strength was evident with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test results in June. Subsequently and consistent with our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, we were pleased to announce our intention to increase State Street's quarterly common stock dividend by 10% to $0.76 per share, beginning in the third quarter, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. As we look ahead, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders this year, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, our strong start to the year continued in the second quarter. We delivered both fee and total revenue growth, which support in modest total operating leverage year-over-year, and a return on equity of nearly 12% in the quarter, all while continuing to make significant investments in our business, controlling expenses and returning capital to our shareholders. I am pleased with the progress we're making to drive better business momentum in sales performance as we execute against the sharpened revenue strategy. We recorded another Alpha mandate win in the quarter, which demonstrated the clear advantage that strategy brings to our organization by delivering a large and completely new client relationship to State Street. We already have good line of sight into 3Q and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our goals of 6 to 8 new Alpha clients, and $350 million to $400 million of servicing revenue -- fee revenue wins this year. And with that, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Thank you, Eric. Operator, we can open it up to questions. Hi, Glenn. It's Ron. You have it correct there. The most of it, the vast majority of it is around client rebalancing. In one case, an extremely large client that's rebalancing away from certain act -- from certain asset classes. So it's idiosyncratic. We don't expect it to continue. And we feel very comfortable with the trajectory that Global Advisors is on both the institutional business and in ETF business. So, Glenn, I mean, we've been pretty consistent about this. We have a very, very strong market position. Now some of that, in the past has been built by M&A if you go back to the 2000s. But if you think about where we are now, it's very strong and the vast majority of our activity is around organic build out of our business. Some of that, just in terms of, focusing on clients within geographies, and some of that focused on building capabilities and extending them to other geographies. That is, by far the -- what our focus is. To the extent and I've said this in the past, I mean, M&A is not a strategy, but it can help us to effectively implement our strategy and it is superior to passes the test of being superior to a return of capital to shareholders, then we'll consider it. But our focus is on building out organically, returning capital to shareholders at a reasonable pace and continuing to accelerate what we do. Yes. So there's -- I think you largely have it. But let me go a little bit deeper, Ken, because if you think about -- let's talk about core servicing fees, what really drives it? First is retention. Second is the amount and rate of onboarding. And then third is do business and sales, and then rinse and repeat. And our retention levels which they -- we've talked about them before and we're continuing to track well against them even coming a little bit higher than what we had planned. Second onboardings, as Eric noted, they've been slower than expected this year. But we see lots of visibility going forward to that increasing. We've got a big book there to onboard and that will start to onboard and -- it should start to onboard in accelerating rate. And then third is sales. And there's two things going on there. One, the amounts we opted in '23, we opted again in '24. We're on track for that increased servicing fee -- sales target. But we also have disproportionate focus on traditional back office fees, either standalone, or if they're associated with Alpha, making sure that when an Alpha assignment comes on board, the back office conversions occur first. And that's part of the learning this whole Alpha process. So that by itself gives us encouragement, and then -- and Eric will probably want to go into this a little bit more, the deconversion that seems like we talked about forever. I mean, we're hitting bottom right now in terms of that. So we'll start to see improvement on that as a comp and as its effect and move beyond it, starting in the next quarter or two. So that's servicing fees. And management fees, we are very encouraged by what we're seeing at SSJ. It's been -- it's part of a carefully crafted strategy, both in the institutional ETFs. We've talked about ETF flows, we've talked about market share and the very important low cost ETFs, which, in effect represent penetration into the retail market, all that is working well. And then finally, we had this historically low volatility in FX. Nonetheless, the team has been highly focused on continuing to build share within our clients to move up on the panels. And [indiscernible] saw some of that pay off in terms of FX in securities finance. Again, there's been a new strategy in place there and some progress there. So this is much of what we do is a game of inches. But there's a lot of inches coming together here that we feel quite good about. Hi, Betsy. Betsy, its Ron. Let me take that. Firstly, just to clarify that the these numbers that we're talking about are sales and not installs, right. So, it wouldn't include anything that's under contract and subject to onboarding at this point. But what -- I mean, I think the way to think about it is, is this, that if you -- that's why Eric gave the four quarter number there. Third and fourth quarter historically for us tend to be a little bit better. Second half of the year is a little bit better than the first half of the year. So that's point number one. Point number two, the pipeline and we feel pretty good about the pipeline. So that's why we're continuing to affirm confidence in that target that we have of $350 million to $400 million. But, Betsy, let me clarify the first part of my message, because I was not clear there. The number would include things that are in contract, but not include anything that's actually been on boarded. So when you see the to be onboarded number that we have out there, that includes basically past sales. So I hope that's clear. I didn't mean to confuse that. Hi, Mike. Mike, it's Ron. Let me take that. I mean, I think that the -- as you would know as well as anybody, the business continues to change. And we've seen the continued move from the mutual fund to the ETF to the FMA. But you're also seeing these firms, particularly the well managed ones respond, and they're responding in a couple of ways. I mean, one new product types are -- I mean, even the most traditional mutual fund companies now have pretty interesting ETF lines. Most of -- they're involved in the DC 401(k) business, they've got a mutual fund offering, but they've got a collective trust offering too. So they're responding to that market pressure. Most of them are figuring out ways to participate in the wealth business, and we continue to respond and support them in that. So the nature of the business is changing. In some cases, some things were more lucrative than others. And so what you're also finding in those businesses, they're very focused on their cost base. Their technology stack, their operating stack, and again, that presses in our favor as we think about the Alpha front to back solution, we are the largest middle office provider by far in the industry and we've gotten quite good at that. So the -- we describe ourselves as an essential partner to our clients, and I think that plays through both in supporting them in their revenue and product activities as well as their cost and operations. Well, I'll start, but Eric, [indiscernible]. But I think if -- what caused it, I mean, there's been really remarkably low dollar volatility. And I think some of the things that have been driving that: one is just the simple strength of the dollar for an awfully long time. And it's almost become too dangerous of thing to bet against the dollar. And so, even in times where you would expect to see some volatility, we simply haven't -- we haven't seen that.

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we reported EPS of $2.15 for the quarter as compared to $2.17 in the second quarter a year ago. EPS was slightly lower year-on-year, but would have been positive growth were it not for an $80 million reserve release last year. As Ron noted, we delivered 3% revenue growth year-over-year reflecting both higher net interest income up 6% as well as higher fee revenues up 2%, which supported modestly positive total operating leverage in the quarter. The second quarter strong performance contributed to an encouraging first half of the year, with both positive fee and positive total operating leverage on a year-to-date basis, excluding notable items relative to the prior year period. Turning now to Slide 4, period end AUC/A and AUM again increased record levels largely supported by market tailwinds. As you can see on the right panel of the slide, market indicators related to our trading business remain challenging in the quarter that we were pleased to see improved client volumes across our FX trading venues, which I will discuss shortly. Turning to Slide 5, servicing fees declined 2% year-on-year, as higher average equity market levels and net new business excluding our previously disclosed client transition were more than offset by pricing headwinds, and lower client activity and adjustments, including the asset mix shift into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. The impact of the previously disclosed client transition with a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth, while lower client activity and adjustments including the asset mix shift into cash was a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point on year on year growth. In addition, we saw the pace of quarterly installations track below expectations in 1Q and 2Q. We do, however, anticipate a pickup over the next few quarters as our higher level of recent sales begin to onboard. Sequentially, servicing fees were up 1% reflecting higher average equity market levels and client activity as transaction volumes tick back up and we saw clients start to put cash back to work. We generated $72 million of servicing fee revenue wins in 2Q and more than $330 million over the last four quarters, with the vast majority in back office, consistent with our strategy to prioritize faster installing custody mandates. At period end, we had $276 million of servicing fee revenues to be installed and $2.4 trillion of AUC/A to be installed. Moving to Slide 6, management fees were up 11% year-on-year primarily reflecting our higher average market levels and net inflows from prior periods, partially offset by the impact of our strategic ETF repricing initiative, which we believe is starting to pay off in both volumes and revenues. Sequentially, the benefit of higher average market levels was offset by net flows and lower performance fees. We are pleased with the steady growth we are delivering in Global Advisors. In the second quarter, we continue to expand the breadth of our offerings with the launch of new funds as we continue to broaden our product range in geographies. Our investment management business had healthy pre-tax margin of 32% in the second quarter, up 3 percentage points year-on-year and up 8 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. Now turning to Slide 7, as I noted, we saw a very nice uptick in client activity in our markets business with higher volumes across our major FX venues. This helped to drive FX trading revenue growth of 11% year-on-year, though volatility remained muted with compressed margin. Securities finance revenues also benefit from higher balances on both agency lending and prime services. However, our U.S Specials activity was subdued in the quarter which impacted margins and contributed to the year-on-year decline in securities finance revenues. Moving to software and processing fees, second quarter performance continued to benefit from strong client engagement with CRD. Though the cadence of on-premise renewals negatively impacted year-on-year performance which is shown in greater detail on the following slides. On Slide 8, as you can see, software enabled and professional services revenues increased 17% in the quarter. And we expect these revenues to represent a greater proportion of our front office software and data business over time as we transition another 20 clients from on-premise to more durable SaaS model over the last year. As we outlined in May, we believe our software business can be a significant revenue growth driver for State Street, potentially reaching a $1 billion in annual revenues over the next 5 years. In addition, we were pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in Alpha. We reported an additional Alpha mandate win and 2 mandates went live in 2Q, bringing the total number of live mandates to 23 at quarter end. As Ron mentioned, this quarter's Alpha win represents a brand new 10-year relationship with a large APAC client. We view long-term Alpha mandates like this are a key benefit of our differentiated Alpha strategy. Turning to Slide 9. NII was stronger-than-expected this quarter, up 6% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially to $735 million as higher investment portfolio yields and higher loan growth more than offset continued deposit mix shift in both periods. In addition, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, we proactively increased our investment portfolio balances at higher yields which benefited NII. Looking at the strong quarterly performance relative to our expectations in early June, we did see an inflow of valuable noninterest bearing deposits in mid June and again in late June as clients geared up for the holiday weekend, although I would note that we did see some reversal during the first week of July. Similarly, NII also benefited from higher interest bearing balances due to our client engagement efforts, as well as better spreads and volumes within our sponsored repo business as more clients join the program. Average deposits increased 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. We would expect to continue to operate at this higher level of deposit balances as we look to the back half of the year. Turning to Slide 10, year-on-year expense growth was contained to less than 3%. In the second quarter, we continue to invest in the business while also delivering productivity benefits in two key areas. The first is associated with our decision to consolidate two operations joint ventures in India late last year and this quarter. The year-on-year savings associated with these two JV consolidations are approximately $20 million in the quarter, excluding integration costs. Second, we benefited from our ongoing organizational process improvements and initiatives, including streamlining and delayering staff [ph] functions to increase our management's span of control, which enabled us to lower our headcount on a pro forma basis, including the JVs by 5 percentage points year-on-year as detailed on the bottom left of the slide. Together, these actions helped to drive down compensation benefit costs by 2% year-on-year in the second quarter, and facilitate our ability to reinvest in our franchise. The combination of the JV consolidations, along with our ongoing initiatives serves as a catalyst and importantly gives us confidence as we continue to deliver on our strategy to simplify our global operating model with meaningful benefits expected to build over time, including more productivity saves, as well as an ability to better serve our clients and invest for the future. Moving to Slide 11, as you can see, our capital levels remained strong and comfortably above the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.2% was slightly higher from the prior quarter, as capital generated from earnings was partially offset by continued dividends and share repurchases, as well as higher RWAs as we support our clients, which in turn drove higher fees and NII. We returned over $300 million in the first quarter to shareholders, followed by $400 million through common share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter, as we've tried to strike the right balance between our capital return goals and the support of our clients. Looking ahead to the back half of the year, we have announced the plan 10% per share quarterly common dividend increase on the heels of a strong performance on this year's CCAR starting in 3Q and subject to Board approval. In addition, our attention is to accelerate the pace of quarterly buybacks relative to the first half of the year. However, given the more modest level of repurchase activity so far this year, the full year payout ratio for 2024 will likely be closer to the 80% to 90% range, in line with our medium term targets. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results, which demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategy to drive sustained business momentum, while delivering positive total operating leverage excluding notable items. With that, let me cover our improved full year outlook, which I would highlight continues to have the potential for variability given the uncertain economic and political environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro assumptions, as we stand here today, we are assuming global equity markets are flattered to second quarter end for the remainder of the year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve as of quarter end, while we expect both FX market volatility and specials to remain needed. Given our strong start to the year and higher average market levels, we now expect that total fee revenue will likely be in the range of up 4% to 5% on a full year basis, somewhat better than our prior expectations for roughly 4% year-on-year growth. Turning to NII, given our 2Q performance, along with the continued benefit of management actions we have taken to support NII growth this year, we now expect full year NII will be up slightly year-over-year, which is also better than our previous guide of down roughly 5% on a full year basis. Finally, given these improved top line expectations, full year expenses are likely to be somewhat higher than our prior outlook of up 2.5% this year. We now expect expenses excluding notable items to be up about 3% this year, given the expected revenue related costs. Importantly, given this improved outlook, we now expect to deliver both positive fee operating leverage and positive total operating leverage for the full year excluding notable items. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ken, its Eric. As you said, we're pleased with the second quarter results on NII. Some of that is the interest rate environment. But a good portion of that is the management actions we've been taking in terms of engaging with our clients on deposits. And really being there for them on both sides of the balance sheet, as we lend and support their growth as well. This quarter was particularly strong. We had a nice tailwind from long-term rates during the quarter that helped you saw us build out our investment portfolio a little more. Deposits ticked up second half of June and towards the end, especially noninterest bearing. But what I find pleasing is that deposits are coming in stronger across the -- what I will call the pricing stack, the transactional deposits, the exception price deposits and initiatives. So across the spectrum and that's really a testament to the engagement that we've had with our clients to be there. I think as we look forward into the third quarter and fourth quarter, we still see some of the headwinds and tailwinds that we've talked about, short-term rates seem like will start to trend down that'll be a little bit of a headwind. Deposits, we're still seeing some of that rotation from noninterest bearing to interest bearing that is slowing. That was -- that rotated out about $2 billion this past quarter and that's been less than the prior quarters. But that still continues and still a little bit of pricing and mix shift that we're seeing in the interest bearing deposit base. So that -- that we see is just playing out through the end of the year, but at a more modest pace. The offsets to that are mix of long-term rates, the lending, that we continue to do, lendings up double digits and that's been purposeful to support our clients and to support NII. And then, tactically adjusting the investment portfolio. And so it's the net of those that probably will come in with some erosion over the next couple of quarters. But we're seeing a place where deposits are come in at a nice and robust level on our balance sheet. Lending continues. And so, we're getting to a point where we're going to start to see I think an inflection of NII and a bottoming, which is nice. And we can see that over the next a few quarters. Hard to tell exactly when, but with the headwinds and tailwinds kind of I'll say equalizing over time, it gives us a good basis to look forward. Brennan, it's Eric. It's nice to see the industry environment top out and begin to reverse, though I think it'll reverse slowly. We've seen the beginning of that and feels like it'll take some time, which is -- which will be fine because remember, our portfolio and our balance sheet is roughly neutral and relatively insulated now from interest rate increases or decreases. We have a slight sensitivity across the balance sheet, but it's light. It's -- if all central banks across the curve cut rates by 25 basis points, we're talking about $5 million per quarter impact on a $2.5 billion base of a full year NII. So that's the -- we're talking about small effects. To your point euro is a good place to start because euro rates increased lagged on the way up and now are starting to move in the opposite direction. We have said, and the euro experience on this first rate move has demonstrated that we expect largely to see symmetry in the betas. So as we -- as rates rose, we lagged and then the betas increased over time towards the back end of the rate cycle. And what we've said is, area by area transaction rate deposits, exception rate deposits, and the initial rate deposits, will tend to see the reversal of that. And so, specifically in euros, we did see that. We -- the beta and the first tick down was similar to the beta on the last tick up and I think is a good representation largely of what we expect to see. And that means that, if you step back even further, we feel like our pricing is set at a healthy level. We have a range of pricing and pools of deposits, and in a way have built real engagement with our clients. So they understood the model as floated up. And similarly they understand the model as rates floated down in the balance of trade, and it comes together nicely. Brennan, it's Eric again. There's been a lot of talks about repo. Now we're saying that most of the NII we earn on our balance sheet is really based on deposit funding and lending. So 90% of our NII is around deposits, loans, investment portfolio. We're talking about 10%, which is on repo. So just for context and it is true repo NII came in a little bit better-than-expected in the second quarter, why? Because there was some dislocation in overnight repo operation of the Fed relative to SOFR. So clients came our way. We also saw dealer balance sheet strain, but the higher than expectation was in the $5 million to $10 million range. It's not a -- it was nice to take. And it was nice to be there for our clients. But in fact, repo has been relatively flat to actually, down a smidge over the last couple of quarters. And that's because it tends to be a thinner margin, but a useful way to accommodate our clients. And we think it's not going to be a large driver of the coming NII. It's fully included in our guide. I think the real big moving parts are really around deposits loans and then followed by investment portfolio and the mix of long and short rates that we'll see. Jim, it's Eric. Calling a -- an inflection or a turn in NII is one of the hardest things to do. And so we've been -- our outlook is that in the next few quarters, we'll begin to see that, but we'll first go from the trends that we're seeing to a stabilization, it'll bounce around some, and then over time tick upwards. The factors are multifaceted. And with a number of ins and outs, you're right, the investment portfolios turning over, it turned over quite a bit in the second half of last year, it's now turning over by about 3, maybe $3 billion to $4 billion a quarter, and that's across HTM and AFS. And because there are some longer dated bonds in HTM, those roll through a little more slowly. But in a way that we have is a sustained amount of, I'll say, tailwind that comes with that because remember the roll-ons in the portfolio versus the roll-offs, those are worth a solid 250 basis point of spread differential. And that'll play through the books as a nice tailwind, assuming long rate stay, somewhere in the area, and we -- and the primary change on the curve is at the front end. So, I think it'll be a component. Right now the biggest component is really the deposit mix pricing levels of noninterest bearing, that's what's moving the needle the most. I mean, all these factors matter. And I think as the deposits stabilize, and we've started to see total deposit levels stabilize last few quarters, we have to see now the mix stabilize. Once that happens, the natural benefit from the investment portfolio rolling through, right, and then the growth in loans, and you've seen us lean into lending. Lending is up more than 10% year-on-year, because we're trying to be out there for our clients. And as we lend to our clients, they actually often do additional servicing business with us. That factor in the investment portfolio and the long-term rates will then turn to a net positive impact on NII in the coming quarters. I think the direct answer is that the rate environment has moved around quite a bit. And we've seen the deposit effects from the rate environment. I think those are relatively been -- those have been telegraphed through the banking system. And we've also seen the Fed balance sheet actions as they've been tightening conditions with their balance sheet, although that slowing and the overnight reverse repo operation is an easing, we've seen that telegraphed through. So I think the exogenous factors that have driven deposits over the last 2 years have largely been telegraphed. And the modest number of interest rate cuts, I don't expect to have that much of an impact on deposit levels. We'll see, but that's our kind of sense from talking with our clients and analyzing the vast array of data that we have. What we feel will make the difference over time is sales. So we talk a lot about servicing fee sales, targeting $350 million to $400 million this year, that's up from $300 million the year before and even less than the year before that. And with a tilt towards custody and remember, it's the custodial activity, not just the accounting or the middle office, but the custodial activity that brings with it balances, deposit balances, because they're needed as part of the, the buffer or the -- to handle the transactional activities that we process for clients. And so as we look forward, as sales continue to accelerate, and then we onboard those sales because both have to happen. That's what we expect will bring on additional deposits in a way are part of our organic growth model, which will bring fee growth, but also bring deposit growth and thus NII into the system at a -- I think at a nice rate, and it'll be year by year by year that that'll help drive growth. Betsy, it's Eric. Let me take that. As we had said and you're reflecting on buybacks were lighter, in first quarter at $100 million than we booked $200 million in second quarter, we expect that pace to accelerate into the third quarter and then again into the fourth quarter. So that's our intention and we have a good amount of room and capital generation each quarter to be able to deliver on that. In terms of the constraints, the ratio constraints, the most important one for us, and I think for our various stakeholders is the CET1 ratio. And that were -- I think we can continue to operate at a good pace, at a good level, but also that allows us a good pace of accelerating buybacks. The Tier 1 leverage or the supplementary leverage ratio are informative, but actually relatively manageable, right, with the right level of preferred equity we could -- we can operate where we need to. I think we've been clear on Tier 1 leverage what our range is, and we'll operate within that range. And we can adjust the preferred equity stack as necessary. We've not really formalized at least externally a supplementary leverage ratio range, but it -- I'd say, it kind of flows the -- in a similar way as the Tier 1 leverage and you can think of those as related from a conceptual and operational standpoint, and both of them are eminently manageable and are not really the constraint when it comes to common share buybacks. It's when we talk buybacks, there's always the -- it depends on market conditions and the environment and so forth. So we always want to be careful with that. And you'd expect that of us as well, Ron and a management team, that's both careful, but also leans into capital return. And you've seen our commitment, I think, we'd certainly -- we certainly feel the $100 million in the first quarter, it was below what we would have liked to deliver. We feel the $200 million was below what we would have liked to deliver. So I think there's a solid increase coming. You can think about it in dollar terms, two points, begin to create a line but that could be a curve as well. And I think you've got enough to go on. I think you've got ... ... you've got enough to go on. You're welcome. Mike, it's Eric. With regard to NII and noninterest bearing deposits, I said the next few quarters. So, I'm giving myself a little bit of room to be honest, because it's hard to predict perfectly. And so I'll stick with a few quarters. I think that kind of works and that certainly covers your range, and maybe a little bit more. So, we just want to live through this. But we can see I think over the horizon here in a way and that's what we wanted to communicate. On the client deconversion, if you recall, we said this would be the largest year on a year-on-year basis. It was originally worth about 2 percentage points of total fees. We said about a percentage point year-on-year this year, half a point year-on-year last year, and about half a point year-on-year next year. So by the end of this year, we'll be through, I'll call it, three quarters of the effect, but they'll still be a piece of that coming through next year, and then it'll be behind us. Mike, it's Eric again. I think we talked about pricing pressure because just part of the natural course of events, right, we get a market, we get pricing increasing -- increases from market upticks. And then with clients they ask for a part of that back. That's just how the business has operated, as you say, for the last 30 years. This quarter and last quarter and this year, and for the rest of the year, we expect pricing headwinds to be in line with the previous years and guidance. We've said pricing headwinds of about 2% per year. We're not seeing any more or any less of that. It tends to be a little more geared towards the asset manager segment, because those are the -- that is the group of clients that has mutual funds and some mutual fund versus ETF shifting. But it's not -- we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary or anything that is unexpected at this point. Vivek, it's Eric. It's -- I would describe that as just part of the normal volatility that we'll see in deposits. I mean we run such a large franchise and our clients transactional activity tends to vary over time. But we're seeing healthy levels of deposits across dollars, across euros. And so we didn't -- we haven't seen anything, particularly surprising in one area or another. I think, total U.S interest bearing deposits, if you look at our addendum are up slightly, euros are up slightly and so on and so forth. So -- and to the extent that there are some movements, not driven by our pricing actions, per se. In truth, clients need a certain amount of transactional deposits to fund their custody accounts. And the pricing tends to be something that we have negotiated and is well understood now, given where we are in the cycle and isn't the determinant [ph] of the of movements at this point. Gerard, I think, to add to that, maybe in two ways. The dollar has been strong and continues to be the dominant currency globally for whether it's petrol, whether it's for core commodities, and the currency of choice. And what we've seen ebbs and flows in potential substitution euros, yuan [ph], et cetera, none of that is really come to pass. And so you have a bit of a stabilizing factor. I think the other thing that we've seen recently is because of the clients have been underweight -- I'm sorry, overweight in cash and underweight in equities and bonds, and they've started to put more of that cash to work, they're doing that both in the U.S and abroad and internationally. And as a result, there's not -- we're not seeing a lot of speculation in currency markets. We're seeing more, okay, I'll describe it as natural and transitional flows. And so we've not seen disruptions on one hand, knock on wood. And on the other hand, we have seen consistent holding of dollars and consistent buying of other currencies. And so, that's created -- it feels like a set of muted volatility levels that are fine for our clients. And our point of view is we need to serve clients during those times. And the more we can offer them ways to trade through us, through our multiple venues, some of them are platforms, some of them are single dealers, some are multi dealer, and then some of them are algos, we'll continue to do that and we'll support them and that'll because of the higher volumes we are seeing notwithstanding the lower volatilities has been fruitful and help drive revenue growth for us on that -- in that area."

Now, let me turn it over to Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we released our first quarter financial results. We had a strong start to the year with our results demonstrating the breadth of our client franchise, the efficacy of our strategy, and our focus on execution. We reported both fee and total revenue growth, all while continuing to invest meaningfully in our business and controlling underlying expenses. Excluding notable items, we delivered both positive fee and total operating leverage, as well as solid EPS growth in Q1 relative to the year ago period. The first quarter was an important milestone. We have detailed our strategic priorities for 2024, including the growth initiatives we are undertaking across each of our business areas, as we continue to both invest in our capabilities and also target further productivity gains. Guided by our purpose to help create better outcomes for the world's investors and the people they serve, our four strategic priorities are aimed at continuing to extend our competitive advantage, while delivering positive fee operating leverage excluding notable items in 2024. These 2024 priorities are: growing fee revenue; extending our leadership in our markets and financing and global advisors franchises; enhancing and optimizing our operating model; and continuing to differentiate our business through innovative client solutions and technology-led capabilities to support business growth. We remain intensely focused on executing against these strategic priorities, particularly in a dynamic operating environment in which financial market expectations continue to change significantly. For example, as inflation remains elevated and economic data continued to be robust, investors pushed back their expectation for the timing of Central Bank rate cuts and treasury yields increased during the first quarter. Despite this, global equity markets performed strongly and volatility remained muted, with many indices setting records as fears of a hard economic landing receded and optimism surrounding the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence continued in Q1. Turning to slide three of our investor presentation, I will review our first quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, 2024 started strongly. Year-over-year, we produced both positive fee and total operating leverage, as well as good EPS growth, excluding notable items. First quarter EPS was $1.37 or $1.69, excluding a notable item related to the increase to the FDIC special assessments. Underlying year-over-year EPS growth was supported by total fee revenue growth and continued common share repurchases, which more than offset the impact of lower NII on total revenue. Underlying expenses continued to be well controlled, supported by our ongoing productivity efforts, with first quarter expenses increasing just 1% year-over-year, excluding notable items, even as we have increased the level of investments in our business. Turning to our business momentum, which you can see on the middle of the slide, we continue to make progress across our client franchise in generating better fee revenue growth. Within asset services, AUC/A increased to a record $43.9 trillion. We generated asset servicing AUC/A wins of $474 billion in Q1, supported by key wins in both North America and Europe. Servicing fee revenue wins totaled $67 million. After hitting our full-year sales target of $300 million in 2023, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our increased servicing fee revenue sales go of $350 million to $400 million in 2024. Our priority to grow fee revenue this year is underpinned by a strategy of leading with service excellence and driving stronger back office sales, differentiating with our State Street Alpha and private markets platforms. Our two new Alpha mandate wins this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute on the strategy, while also showcasing the clear competitive advantage and differentiation that Alpha creates for our business. For example, both Alpha mandate wins this quarter include back office services, which can install quickly, allowing us to realize revenue faster. Further, one mandate is our second Alpha for private markets win, a key growth area for us. Encouragingly, both of these Alpha wins were takeaways from a key competitor, with one of the wins having no existing services with State Street prior to becoming an Alpha client, and the other a shared client that will now consolidate back office with State Street. Within markets and financing, even as low FX volatility created a headwind for the industry in the first quarter, we attracted higher FX client volumes, both sequentially and year-over-year, supported by our market-leading and wide-ranging FX trading solutions. In FX, we were pleased to see higher client volumes in the 8% Q-over-Q fee revenue growth. We also expanded our markets franchise. Within outsourced trading, we continue to expand our product capabilities in geographical reach completing the acquisition of CF Global Trading in Q1. Global Advisors perform well, buoyed by higher equity markets, the strategic actions we have taken to position our asset management business for growth, and the benefits of the strong finish in step-off point at year-end 2023. 1Q 2024 management fees of $510 million are the highest since the first quarter of 2022. While GA experienced total aggregate outflows in Q1, this was driven by the impact of a large, but expected single client redemption within the institutional business. We saw continued momentum in the defined contribution business driven by our target day franchise. Encouragingly, we saw cash net inflows of $9 billion in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of positive net inflows of our cash business. ETF AUM reached a record $1.4 trillion at quarter end with GA continuing to gather net inflows and expand market share within U.S. low-cost ETFs. Now let me spend a moment on our continuing productivity efforts. We have a detailed set of initiatives across our business aimed at creating cost efficiencies and lasting productivity improvements. Regarding our ongoing operating model transformation, which forms an important part of these productivity initiatives. As you know, we are streamlining our operating model in India, and last quarter we consolidated our first operations joint venture in the country. I am pleased to note that the consolidation of our second operations joint venture in India closed on April 1. Combined, these two consolidations will propel the continued end-to-end transformation of our global operations and enable State Street to unlock productivity savings in the years ahead as we simplify our operating model. Before I conclude my opening remarks, I would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength. Total capital return amounted to $308 million in the first quarter, consisting of common share dividends and share repurchases. I would highlight that we have returned a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders in recent quarters, with total capital return over the last six quarters equivalent to almost 30% of State Street's total market cap at quarter end. As we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return this year, as we have outlined previously, it remains our intention to return approximately 100% of earnings in 2024 in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, we have delivered a strong start to the year as demonstrated by both sequential and year-over-year total fee revenue growth, encouraging business wins, strong underlying expense discipline, and continued capital return. As we look ahead, we remain highly focused on the execution of a set of clear strategic priorities for 2024. These strategic priorities are backed by detailed action plans aimed at driving growth across each of our business areas. Underpinning this execution is a set of business investments paired with a comprehensive set of productivity initiatives aimed at driving longer-term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and generating positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Now let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\nEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide four, I'll begin my review of our first quarter financial results, which included a $0.32 EPS impact from an additional FDIC special assessment, as described within the notable items table on the right of the slide. As Ron noted, we produced a strong start to the year. On the left panel, you can see that total fee revenue was up both sequentially and year-on-year. Relative to the year-ago period, we delivered robust management fee growth, higher front office software and data revenue, and servicing fee growth, while underlying expenses were well controlled. As I mentioned during the first quarter, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $27 million, largely due to two CRE names. All told, we generated both positive total and fee operating leverage relative to the year ago, excluding notable items. We also delivered solid year-on-year EPS growth of 11%, excluding notable items, which was supported by the continuation of our share buybacks in the first quarter. Turning now to slide five. We saw period end AUC/A increase by 17% on a year-on-year basis and 5% sequentially to a record level. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end market levels, net new business and client flows. I would note that we have seen a mixed shift into cash and cash equivalents with an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points of total AUC/A versus a year ago. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased primarily due to higher period end market levels and client flows. As global advisors, period and AUM also increased to a record level, up 20% year-on-year, largely reflecting higher period end market levels and net inflows, and up 5% sequentially, primarily due to higher period end market levels. At the right center of the slide, the market volatility indices provide a useful indicator of client transactional activity that drives servicing fees, spreads in FX trading, and specials activity in agency lending. Turning to slide six, on the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average market levels, partially offset by pricing headwinds, a previously disclosed client transition, and lower client activity and adjustments, including changes in certain client asset mix into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the pace of installation started slower than we expected in the first quarter. Let me dimension some of these items for you. As I've told you before, the impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth. In addition, lower client activity and adjustments, including the client asset mix shift to cash, was also a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth this quarter, some of which we believe is cyclical. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 1%, primarily as a result of higher average market levels, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments, including the changes to certain asset mix and pricing headwinds. On the bottom of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. In the first quarter, we generated $67 million of servicing fee wins, nicely spread across both North America and Europe. As you recall, solid sales in North America like this was one of the goals that we had described at a conference last fall. In addition, we had $291 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end, up $71 million year-on-year, and $21 million quarter on quarter. We also had $2.6 trillion of AUC/A to be installed at period end. Turning now to slide seven, first quarter management fees were up 12% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average market levels and net inflows from the prior periods, partially offset by the impacts of the strategic ETF product suite repricing initiative. Related to the prior quarter, management fees were up 6%, due to similar reasons, partially offset by lower performance fees. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, following record inflows in 4Q ‘23, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, the overall flows were relatively flat in first quarter. Our spider portfolio, U.S., low-cost suite achieved continued market share gains driven by net inflows of $13 billion. In our institutional business, we saw first quarter net outflows of $19 billion, primarily driven by a single client. That said, we saw continued momentum in the U.S.-defined contribution area with record AUM of approximately $730 billion. Lastly, in our cash franchise, we saw first quarter net inflows of $9 billion, the fourth consecutive quarter of positive net flows into cash. Turning now to slide eight, first quarter FX trading services revenue was down 3% year-on-year, but up 8% sequentially. Relative to the year ago period, the decrease was mainly due to lower spreads associated with subdued FX volatility, partially offset by higher volumes as client engagement increased across nearly all of our FX venues. Quarter-on-quarter, the 8% revenue increase primarily reflects higher volumes with particular strength in our EM business, as well as higher direct FX spreads. First quarter securities' finance revenues were down 12% year-on-year, mainly due to lower agency balances and lower spreads, primarily associated with significantly lower industry specials activity. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, we have seen agency lending balances up as demand is rising. Software and processing fees were up 25% year-on-year in Q1, largely driven by higher revenues associated with CRD, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Quarter-on-quarter, software and processing fees declined 13%, primarily due to our lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by higher lending-related fees. Finally, other fee revenue for the quarter increased $5 million year-on-year. Sequentially, other fee revenue increased $17 million, largely driven by an episodic currency devaluation in the prior quarter, which did not occur. Moving to slide nine, you'll see on the left panel that first quarter, front office software and data revenue increased 32% year-on-year, primarily as a result of continued SAS implementations and conversions, driving higher professional services and software enabled revenue growth. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was down 20%, primarily driven by lower on-premise renewals and installations. Turning to some of the Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we were pleased to report two additional Alpha wins, including our second Alpha for Private Markets mandate. In addition three mandates went live in the first quarter, bringing the total number of live mandates to 21. First quarter ARR increased 19% year-on-year, driven by over 20 SAS client implementations and conversions over the last year. Turning to slide 10, first quarter NII decreased 7% year-on-year, but increased 6% sequentially to $716 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to deposit mix shift and lower average non-interest bearing deposit balances, partially offset by the impact of higher average interest rates, client lending growth, and investment portfolio positions. We were pleased to report a sequential increase in NII, which was primarily driven by higher investment securities yields, an increase in average interest-bearing deposits, and loan growth, partially offset by the decline in average non-interest-bearing deposits. The NII results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected, primarily driven by strength in both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit balances towards the end of the quarter. While it is difficult to forecast the path of deposits in the current environment, we're pleased with the success that we are having in engaging our clients. On the right of this slide, we provide highlights from our average balance sheet during the first quarter. Average deposits increased 4% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by client-balanced growth across the interest-bearing deposit stack, partially offset by a reduction in non-interest-bearing deposits. Average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased by less than $3 billion quarter-on-quarter. Cumulative U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 80% since the start of the current rate cycle with cumulative foreign currency betas for the same period continuing to be lower in the 30% to 60% range depending on currency. Turning to slide 11, first quarter expenses excluding notable items increased barely 1% year-on-year as we both invested more to fuel fee growth and increased the size for our productivity and optimization savings efforts by more than 50%. On a line-by-line basis, excluding notable items, on a year-on-year basis, compensation employee benefits decreased 3%, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation and salaries, as well as a decline in contractor spend that was partially driven by the consolidation of one of our operations joint ventures in India. Information systems and communications expenses increased 4%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the optimization savings and vendor savings initiatives. Transaction processing increased 4%, mainly reflecting higher broker fees due to increased global market volumes. Occupancy increased 10%, partially due to the real estate costs associated with the consolidation of the joint venture in India, which used to form part of the contractor cost within compensation and benefits, partially offset by footprint optimization. And other expenses increased 5% largely due to the timing of foundation funding. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on our transformation efforts. If you recall, consolidating the first operations joint venture last October increased our FTE headcount as we insourced those capabilities. However, it also came with an expected financial benefit excluding integration costs of $20 million over the course of the year. As Ron mentioned, the consolidation of our second operations joint venture in India closed on April 1. And this will also come with an increase in additional headcount from 2Q, as well as expected financial benefits. The consolidation of these two joint ventures will be a catalyst for the next phase of State Street's global operations transformation and enable us to create a second wave of service improvements and productivity savings next year. Moving to slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we detail the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, our capital levels remain well above the regulatory minimums. While we continue to focus on optimizing our capital stack, the strength of our capital position enables us to extend our balance sheet to support our clients. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.1% was down approximately 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the expected normalization of RWA. The LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 107% and 130% of State Street Bank and Trust. Our exceptionally strong liquidity metrics benefit from the deep and diversified nature of our funding base and active balance sheet management. In the quarter, we were pleased to return $308 million to shareholders, consisting of $100 million of common share repurchases and $208 million in declared common stock dividends. As Ron noted, we continue to expect to return around 100% of earnings to shareholders this year. In summary, we're quite pleased with the quarter. We have a clear strategy for growth, a detailed set of priorities that we are executing against in order to drive continued positive both business momentum and expect to deliver increased fee operating leverage this year, excluding notable items. Finally, let me cover our full-year and second quarter outlook, which I would highlight continues to have the potential for variability given the macro environment we're operating in. In terms of our current assumptions, as we stand here today, we're assuming global equity markets flat to first quarter end for the remainder of the year, which implies daily averages up 5% quarter-on-quarter in 2Q and up around 17% for the full-year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve, which I would note continues to move while we expect FX market volatility will remain muted. Given our strong start to the year and higher average market levels, we think total fee revenue for the full-year will now be at the higher end of our prior guide of up 3% to 4% year-on-year, so up a solid 4%, which is better than our previous outlook. There are, however, episodic and industry headwinds impacting our servicing business this year, including a previously disclosed client transition and the impact of client activity and adjustments, which includes the client asset makeshift into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. We believe some of these factors are cyclical in nature, and we expect to offset a portion with higher sales and additional management actions this year. Turning to NII as a result of our first quarter outperformance, strong deposit growth and the improved interest rate outlook, we now expect full-year NII will be down approximately 5% year-on-year, which is better than our previous guide of down approximately 11%. On expenses, we expect full-year expenses, ex-notables, will be roughly in line with our prior guide of up about 2.5%, but with the potential for some additional revenue-related costs this year. Given our improved outlook, we now expect to deliver additional positive fee operating leverage for the full-year, excluding notable items. Finally, turning to 2Q on a quarter-on-quarter basis and excluding notable items, we would expect total fee revenue to be up 1.5% to 2%, NII to be down 2% to down 5% and expenses up about 2% to 2.5%, excluding the seasonal compensation expenses in 1Q and notable items. We think the provisions for credit losses could be in the $15 million to $25 million range in 2Q, and we would expect to have a better view on that later in the quarter as we continue to monitor our portfolio. Lastly, we expect 2Q tax rate to be approximately 22%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\nRon O'Hanley: Operator, we can now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Brennan Hawken at UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric, your updated guide sort of suggests that NII, you guys expect to pull back a little bit here from this strong result here in the first quarter. But one of the things that I noticed was repo was particularly robust in the quarter. Could you give a little color around what drove that strength and how sustainable it is? And is some of that normalization embedded in your outlook? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: Brennan, it's Eric. You know, there are a number of factors that drove the upswing in NII into the first quarter. The bulk of that was actually deposit balances coming in stronger than we had expected, both on the interest-bearing side across the stack and non-interest-bearing as well. That made up for the $30 million uptick in the -- in terms of our results relative to our expectation. The repo balances did tick up as well. They were a small part, but worth in NII terms, about a percentage point of more NII than we had expected. And I think what we're seeing is that as the conditions in the economy continue to evolve, clients are holding more cash on their balance sheets, or then putting that into a variety of different instruments. Sometimes it's on deposits, sometimes it's on sweeps, and sometimes it's in repo. And that's also been, in particular on the repo side, been aided a bit by the reduction in the feds overnight repo operation. So it's really a mix of factors that we're seeing, which together though are driving a better NII performance, which we're pleased with.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes, great. Thank you. You also quantified the impact of the BlackRock transition. So thanks for that. It does seem as though maybe that impact is a little larger than your prior expectation. Do I have the right read on that? And maybe could you give us an update on where we stand as far as the ongoing impact goes?\nEric Aboaf: Sure, Brennan, it's Eric again. The previously announced client transition that we had referenced is in line in terms of amounts that we had expected. If you recall, we had said it would be worth about 2 percentage points of servicing fees this year, which is about a percentage point of total fees. And remember, if you go back to our original disclosure over the last couple of years, we had described the total amount to be worth about 2 percentage points of total fees. And we're seeing about half of that come through on a year-on-year basis this quarter and for this year. And so, you know, fully in line with what we had previously described.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay, thanks for taking my questions.\nEric Aboaf: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Glenn Schorr at Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello there. One quick follow-up on the NII stuff, and thank you for all the details. The balance is coming in, in March. I know these things are really hard to predict, but is something happening with the client discussions and the overall profitability management that might give you confidence that those balances stick? Or should we think of this as rates are higher, parking balances with a safe custodian?\nEric Aboaf: Glenn, we've been heavily engaged with our clients over the last year, I'd say, year and a half, as we've seen, you know, quite a shift in the industry environment and, you know, the evolution of deposits in the banking system. I'd answer your question in a -- at a couple different levels. I think first, going into this year, we had expected total client deposit balances in the $200 billion to $210 billion. And we now see that in the $210 billion to $220 billion for this quarter, And to be honest, we expect that we continue at around that level. And a lot of that is both the engagement that we've had with clients. They all have cash and we certainly encourage them to bring it to us. And part of that is the way we think about client relationships, client profitability, the client services that we can offer. And so I think some of what you're seeing here in the higher aggregate levels of deposits is due to our management action. You know, I think in addition to that, there do tend to be somewhat higher deposits in the banking system. So the tide has been gently rising, I'd say very gently, and that's been helpful. And we expect that to be relatively neutral going forward, but we'll obviously need to see based on the actions, the various actions at the Fed and how they evolve.\nGlenn Schorr: Very cool. Appreciate that. One quickie, you can't comment on the specifics, but I'm more talking the big picture. You were named in some stories potential interest in some private credit manager. I'm more talking big picture of where theoretically that might fit in and just I like the better flows on CNS, SSGA, but strategically what are you focused on in terms of continuing growth across that franchise?\nRon O'Hanley: Yes, Glenn, It's Ron. So we've tried to be quite clear above what we're doing over at SSGA. I mean, first is around continuing to grow the ETF franchise. As you know, our legacy strength is in the institutional business, where we continue to be quite strong, and we've focused a lot over the last several years on growing the low-cost ETF franchise, which tends to find its way into retail portfolios through intermediaries. That led to the repricing initiative that we did last year, which in retrospect is proven to be quite a smart move because the market share has gone up and those portfolios tend not to move, these are buy and hold investors. So ETFs would be one and then we continue to grow the active space, typically with working with very close partners of ours, and we see a lot of runway inactive. And then finally, fixed income, particularly out, we have a strong fixed income offering here in the U.S., and we've built it out quite a bit in the last couple of years in Europe, and you're seeing lots of strength in the ETF ecosystem in Europe. Second area of growth is really trying to leverage the institutional client base, because its legacy is the passive index business. If we have an institutional relationship, we tend to be the number one or number two manager on their platform. That leads you, that gives you a seat at the table and we believe it gives us an ability to potentially distribute other, kinds of, products and services. So that's where a lot of our focus is now on the institutional business. And then finally, continuing to deepen. We have a global franchise, but there's areas that we can deepen it more. You've heard us talk about Europe, and we're focused just as much on Asia Pacific as those markets continue to grow, and we're able to leverage the positions we have, but really focusing on deepening as opposed to broadening geographic reach. So that in a nutshell is how we're thinking about it, and we're pleased with how it's playing out.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that, Ron. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Ken Usdin at Jefferies. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, Ken, your line is open. Could you please unmute? No response. Moving on to Alex Blostein at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks. Another one for NII, I guess good quarter, good guide for the second quarter as well and that's sort of elevating your full-year NII guidance also. But similarly, I guess to kind of what we saw in your guidance last quarter, the back half of the year seems to have a pretty meaningful drop off for the tune of maybe $100 million bucks or so versus the quarterly run rate. Eric, I guess given your comments on deposits being stable and higher rates are kind of are where they are, you still get in the benefit of repricing on the securities portfolio? What sort of informs this sort of decline in NII towards the back of the year?\nEric Aboaf: Alex, it's Eric. You know, we're going to continue to see some of the trends that we have been seeing, and it's just a matter of how the various pieces, you know, partially or fully offset each other over time. You know, we're going to continue to see a tailwind from the level of rates, at least given the current forward curve, because that plays through the investment portfolio and gives us a tailwind, as does some continued growth in lending. The headwind that we've been navigating through, which I would describe comes in steps, and sometimes it's a step down, sometimes half a step back up, is around the deposit levels across the interest-bearing stack, where we're just seeing deposits, I think, at nice levels, to be honest, while we continue to see the grind down of non-interest bearing deposits. And we do expect another quarter of that non-interest bearing deposits to trend down and then to flatten out in the second-half of the year. I think, so you'll see those trends continue. I think you'll -- we'll see where we come out. But you know, if you take our guide together, we expect a modest step down into the second quarter, and then we see a leveling off in the third and fourth quarter of our NII. I think in the past we've talked about being in a range of $500 million to $600 million a quarter. We're now seeing and expect to be comfortably above the $600 million per quarter range. But it's those factors as headwinds and tailwinds that'll play through, that'll kind of dictate exactly where we come out. But I think as I said earlier, the level of client engagement that we've had in terms of putting deposits with us, putting deposits at different price points with us. Some of those are the core transactional deposits that need to support custody accounts, and some of those are the discretionary amount of deposits. It's been a real priority for the franchise and I think one that we've shown some good success in. And that's really creating, I think, this better expectation than we had earlier signaled at the beginning of the year, and one that we think will endure and then, you know, provide the stability and over time upside in NII in the coming years.\nAlex Blostein: Great. All right. I think, that's helpful. My second question is around expenses. You talked about how consolidation of the GV, I guess, that took place recently in April here, will create a new wave of optimization for next year, if I got that right? Can you just outline what that could mean in terms of incremental, either rejuvenating benefits or cost benefits, however you want to frame that, and what that means for maybe the overall kind of expense growth for the franchise? I know you're holding the line this year really well, but is there an opportunity to kind of continue that into 2025 as well? Thanks.\nRon O'Hanley: Yes, Alex, it's Ron here. I think it's good to focus on what we said here because we've talked to you and your colleagues just about ongoing productivity improvement. We've been at it for years. And we do believe this unlocks a potential, not a potential, but a new wave of productivity growth. And why is that? Well, firstly, almost by definition, if you're taking these ventures on, you're eliminating the margin that was in it, that was in our expenses, that now comes out, right? So you've got that as a near immediate tailwind. But more importantly, and more important for the long-term, is that we can really complete and take advantage of true end-to-end process improvement and simplification. We had created through the JVs, which go back to the early days of our off-shoring journey. We created a lot of complication. Unintentionally, we created a lot of complication. This enables us to get at that. The work has already started. Our operations folks are spending a lot of time in India there. They've done some recent hiring and brought on some great leadership there. So if you think about the importance of India to our operations and, you know, the amount of work that passes through there, between this end-to-end simplification, this ability to eliminate checkers of checkers of checkers and all those kinds of things, we see an enormous amount of opportunity to improve. And then finally, as we continue our technology investment, a lot of that will be directed there. It'll be directed at some of the things that, you know, in the past you would have said, well, let's take advantage of labor arbitrage. And now the technology is at a cost level where we can simply eliminate the labor and not have, particularly for some of these repetitive kinds of tasks between machine learning and other kinds of AI that you can use to replace labor. And you end up then with a one -- a lower labor cost, but more importantly, you've got job content that's very attractive to people, and people want to make careers here as opposed to feeling like they're stuck in this dead-end repetitive task. So we are very optimistic about this.\nAlex Blostein: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just a confirmation on the guidance you gave, Eric, on the 2Q fee revenue up 1% to 2%, NII down 2% to 5%, expenses up 2% to 2.5%. Is that sequential for revenue and year-over-year for expenses?\nEric Aboaf: No, it was sequential for every one of those as you look forward. So it was all on a 1Q to 2Q basis.\nBrian Bedell: 2Q basis, okay. So then going back to the NII guide, I think you also said down 2% to 5% versus the 7% to 16% in 2Q and then did you say down again in 3Q and then flattening out or flattening out in 3Q?\nEric Aboaf: What I described is a flatter second-half of the year. And so, you know, there are different paths here, to be honest. And it really will just depend on the level of deposits, the level of interest rates, just how the pale of some of the climate deposit or pricings that we've described come through, or the back end of those. So I gave some, you know, a high level view, but Brian, I think there's a range of scenarios. But we do have some confidence in the expectation that in aggregate, NII will be down 5% from a full-year basis, and that's quite a bit better than the down 10% that we had previously guided towards.\nBrian Bedell: Right, yes. Then if I just get -- if I use the flattish assumption, I'm more like flat for the year on that cadence, but would that be sort of a, as you said, a range, but a flat NII outcome year-over-year would be at the better end of your range, or is that sort of really difficult to achieve?\nEric Aboaf: No, let me try to clarify. We expect total NII to be down 5% on a year-on-year basis for the full-year. What I did say is that we expect NII to be in 3Q and 4Q to be roughly the same, to be flattish between those two quarters. And so, you know, now the question is exactly how much does it come down in second quarter, and then from second quarter into the combination of third and fourth quarter, how much does that come down? And there is a range of different scenarios I think you could foresee. But the reason we're trying not to over-spec the exact quarter by quarter by quarter by quarter expectation is there's just underlying volatility out there in the kind of macroeconomic conditions in the risk on risk off sentiment in the central bank's actions right. And then in our client deposit levels. And so hopefully that gives you enough context to go on.\nBrian Bedell: That's super helpful. And then maybe just on the private markets wins, it sounds like momentum is improving there. Maybe if you could just talk about what your pipeline is looking like in private markets, Alpha and kind of your expectations over the next one to two years?\nRon O'Hanley: Brian, it's Ron. I mean, we've talked about the private businesses being a double-digit growth business. We stand by that. We see lots of potential growth. Private markets, Alpha is developing nicely for us, largely for some of the -- for many of the same reasons that Alpha itself has. It's an opportunity as these firms become more complex, have complex operating and technology stacks. It's a way to not just lower some costs, but improve operations and future-proof operations. So it's developing well. So we remain optimistic about it.\nBrian Bedell: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from David Smith at Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid Smith: Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about your capital priorities today? Your payout ratio in the first quarter was somewhat below your 100% full-year target?\nEric Aboaf: David, it's Eric. We gave guidance at the beginning of the year on a full-year basis purposely, right, because each quarter there's going to be a different set of variables as we navigate through. So we described capital return in aggregate to be around total earnings for the year and we reaffirmed that in our prepared remarks. If you then go into the specifics of the first quarter, remember we had expected a normalization of the lower than usual RWA that came through in the fourth quarter. Some of that is just market factors playing through on the FX book. Some of that is equity markets upticking in the agency and securities financing space. And some of it, to be honest, is just putting capital to work with our clients, where we're engaging with them, and that's driving some of the fee revenue growth that you saw. At the same time, our priority is to get capital back to shareholders. We continued our dividend at pace, as you'd expect. We had some buybacks this quarter. If you do the math, that buyback activity will increase going forward for the next few quarters. We also had the new information about the FDIC assessment. And so we had to accrue for that expense instead of returning capital to shareholders for this particular quarter. So anyway, just a way to describe, we're on track with our priority and to be honest, our commitment to get capital back to shareholders in line with earnings this year. And it will just -- every quarter is a little bit different, but I think you'll see that accelerate into the second quarter.\nDavid Smith: And I think you gave the tax rate for the second quarter. Are you still expecting 21% to 22% for the full-year?\nEric Aboaf: I think I need to quickly go back to the January remarks, but we did not update those and -- so I think that's a good place, a good estimate to use for the full-year, the one that you had back on the January call. Yes, that's correct.\nDavid Smith: Okay. And just one last cleanup. The preferred dividend, they'll still be elevated in the $50 million to $55 million range in the second quarter, but then it will be kind of more like $40 million in the second-half of the year?\nEric Aboaf: Yes. Yes, that's correct. We're just kind of moving through this past quarter 1 and quarter 2 between the redemptions, the issuance and redemptions and then literally, the tactical timing of some of the dividends, you've got it right. There's one more quarter of elevation in the $50 million to $55 million range next quarter, meaning second quarter and then it will run at about $40 million a quarter from third quarter onwards.\nDavid Smith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Mike Mayo at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Can you hear me?\nRon O’Hanley: We can.\nMike Mayo: Can you talk about the relationship between stock markets and revenues you used to have for every 10% change the S&P 500, it impacts your servicing fees by x amount. Can you remind us what that is these days and how much of a lag there is with that? And along with that, I guess your guidance for NII instead of being down 10% to down 5%. What exactly changed the last kind of month or so?\nEric Aboaf: Yes, Mike, it's Eric. Let me answer those in reverse order. On NII, what happened in the first quarter was really higher deposit balances across the interest-bearing stock and even relative to our expectations on noninterest-bearing in March. So that changed in a positive way, created an uplift into the first quarter that we had not expected. The last time we gave full-year guidance on NII was back in January when we expected it to be down, on a full year basis, 10% for the full-year. And it's only today that we've reassessed that. We did not reassess that back at the beginning of March. We reassessed that today. And what we're factoring in is the higher step off, the higher level of deposits with us generally. And the fewer rate cuts that we're expecting from central banks around the world. And so that's what gets us to a better full-year guide on NII. If I then turn to the equity market question, how it factors through servicing fees. We need to be -- we need to go through it in pieces. And so let me start. First, what matters to us is not just the S&P equity index, because we're global, right? More than 40% of our revenues are broad, including in emerging markets. And while the S&P is up year-on-year 28%. The All-World Index is up only 18%, and that's what's more material to our financial statements given the international and global footprint that we have. With that 18%, we'd expect a substantial tailwind of servicing fees on a year-on-year basis and up 4% to 5% range, typically. But it tends to move around. As you said, sometimes there's a bit of timing there. Sometimes there's a bit of mix there and so forth. What we did see that was a headwind to that this year were two things: one was the previously announced client transition, and that was worth about 2 points of servicing fee headwinds; and then we've continued to see a lower -- or I'll describe different level of client activity that was worth almost 2 percentage points of headwind this year, some of which we think is cyclical. Some of that is transactional activity that we've talked about that we tend to get paid for on a unit basis through our fee schedules. And then this quarter, we also referenced the shift to client cash and cash equivalents within the AUC/A stack, which tends to come in at a much lower fee rate for custody and accounting services. And so those were the pieces that went against us.\nMike Mayo: And just one follow-up, just -- you said more-than-expected deposits. Why was that?\nEric Aboaf: I think the more-than-expected deposits is really driven by two factors. One, is that there tends to be more cash in the system, in the banking system today. We think that's a mix of central bank actions, in particular, in the U.S., the reduction in the overnight repo operation that the Fed is running. That comes back in a way into our clients or into the banking system. And that's been a -- I think that's generally improved liquidity conditions or added to what is -- our very liquid conditions have made them even more liquid. And then the second factor, to be honest, is over the last 1.5 years, two years, we've been very engaged, and I'd say, increasingly engaged with clients on where they put their cash. They put their cash with us in deposits, in repo, in money market, in money market suites, because every one of those areas we offer services to our clients. And I think what we've done over time is sharpened our engagement with our clients, and that's resulted in more cash and deposits with us in a way that we find is healthy, obviously, for our balance sheet. We're always delighted to keep cash, but also helps with earnings and margin and economically.\nMike Mayo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Rajiv Bhatia at Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nRajiv Bhatia: Great. Good morning. Can you comment on how the pricing environment is for your servicing business? If inflation remains higher for longer, should we expect lower pricing headwinds? And then as I understand it, about 60% of your service fees is asset-based. How do pricing headwinds compare in the asset-based bucket versus the non-asset-based bucket? Thanks.\nEric Aboaf: It's a broad question. We've been in an environment, I think, the last four years or so where we've seen pricing headwinds in the servicing business to be roughly in the 2% headwind level. And that's kind of -- that will float around a bit by quarter. It will float around on the margin a little bit by year, but it's substantially below what we had seen way back in 2019. And which was, I'll describe, a bubble of repricing. I described it that way because during this time, we've seen, to your point, a very accentuated rise in inflation. We've now seen a partial reduction in inflation. And that's not really had a large or substantial effect to our general fee rates or our -- or servicing fees. And so it's been -- I think it's not particularly determinative of that. In terms of our fee schedules, you're right, the fee schedules have several components. They have asset-based. There's an asset under custody basis for some of the fees which is about half. There are some transactional fees. There are just some flat fees. There are some per account fees. And those usually end up being negotiated as a package. It's not that when there is a -- when we have negotiations that one particular part of that package is treated very differently. We have large, sophisticated clients. They think of it as a package. And to be honest, they're looking for a fair set of -- a fair amount of fees so that as a partnership, which lasts often 10, 15, 20, in some cases, 30, 40 years, right? That they feel they're getting value and that they feel that we, as a custodian can deliver on what their expectations are. And so it comes to be a reasonable accommodation, I think, in our minds, in their minds.\nRajiv Bhatia: Got it, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Ken Usdin at Jefferies. Please go ahead, Ken.\nKen Usdin: Thanks, Ron, Eric, sorry for that earlier. Sorry for that earlier. Just one follow-up on just the servicing fee algorithm. So with all the commentary you've made. And you show us the good detail about the business wins and the fees to come on, and we know about the headwinds, some cyclical, some due to deconversion. Do you have a line of sight when we can really start to see that back office line start to move up in a positive way. And I know we have to consider the middle office and the whole front office kit as a together thing. But that's still the biggest line, and that's still kind of flattish on a year-over-year basis with all the things we talked about. But is there any path forward where you can kind of see some of those headwinds abating and some of the growth starting to come on and transitions that we can see a better growth rate overall? Thanks.\nRon O’Hanley: Yes. Ken, why don't I start here? The transition, I know it feels like it's been going on forever, but that will basically abate. And the effect of that will go away, more or less go away next year, assuming no other changes on the client side. So a headwind goes to zero. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, you've seen -- you saw the sales performance last year. You're seeing the sales performance this year that's building up the to be installed business. That still remains very, very high for us. Part of it is some complicated kinds of Alpha clients that they will install, they are installing -- they typically tend to install in waves and tranches. So we'll make progress against that. But I would note from sales performance last year and it continued in the quarter, there's a fair amount of back office in some of these recent sales, which just installs faster. And so we're quite optimistic about the opportunities here in fee revenue growth, particularly servicing fee revenue growth as you overcome headwinds, but more importantly, start to reap the benefits of what we've sold in Alpha, what we sold in back office and get those installed.\nEric Aboaf: And Ken, it's Eric. I would just add that we've had these client activity headwinds that we described, which is a mix of risk-off sentiment, which has led to lower transactions through the custodial accounts. And then we've described this shift towards a cash mix, right? We don't see those just continuing at the same pace. We see that as somewhat cyclical. You'd expect -- I don't think we generally expect much more cash to be on hand with clients. There are -- I think there's a case to be made that cash levels of client should actually start to get deployed over the next year and could even be neutral or a possible tailwind. So I think we've been going through a bit of a cyclical phase here on those environmental and activity type and mix headwinds. And I think without those, you could then see through to some of what Ron described around sales, installation and the underlying growth of the franchise.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And one follow-up then is also we can see the wins and what you put on and the yet to be installed to Ron's point. Can you just talk about just the pipeline, is the pipeline continuing to strengthen? Is it consistent? Have you now put more of that pipeline through? Where do we stand on that?\nRon O’Hanley: Yes. Ken, I mean, I think what you should have heard from us today is that we have a sales target that we talked about in January, we're standing by that sales target. That's significantly up from last year, which was significantly up from the year before. So I mean you get there because of the pipeline. So we're encouraged by our pipeline.\nKen Usdin: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Ron for closing remarks.\nRon O’Hanley: Well, thanks to all of you on the call for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending. And at this time, we do ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Ron O'Hanley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we released our first quarter financial results. We had a strong start to the year with our results demonstrating the breadth of our client franchise, the efficacy of our strategy, and our focus on execution. We reported both fee and total revenue growth, all while continuing to invest meaningfully in our business and controlling underlying expenses. Excluding notable items, we delivered both positive fee and total operating leverage, as well as solid EPS growth in Q1 relative to the year ago period. The first quarter was an important milestone. We have detailed our strategic priorities for 2024, including the growth initiatives we are undertaking across each of our business areas, as we continue to both invest in our capabilities and also target further productivity gains. Guided by our purpose to help create better outcomes for the world's investors and the people they serve, our four strategic priorities are aimed at continuing to extend our competitive advantage, while delivering positive fee operating leverage excluding notable items in 2024. These 2024 priorities are: growing fee revenue; extending our leadership in our markets and financing and global advisors franchises; enhancing and optimizing our operating model; and continuing to differentiate our business through innovative client solutions and technology-led capabilities to support business growth. We remain intensely focused on executing against these strategic priorities, particularly in a dynamic operating environment in which financial market expectations continue to change significantly. For example, as inflation remains elevated and economic data continued to be robust, investors pushed back their expectation for the timing of Central Bank rate cuts and treasury yields increased during the first quarter. Despite this, global equity markets performed strongly and volatility remained muted, with many indices setting records as fears of a hard economic landing receded and optimism surrounding the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence continued in Q1. Turning to slide three of our investor presentation, I will review our first quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, 2024 started strongly. Year-over-year, we produced both positive fee and total operating leverage, as well as good EPS growth, excluding notable items. First quarter EPS was $1.37 or $1.69, excluding a notable item related to the increase to the FDIC special assessments. Underlying year-over-year EPS growth was supported by total fee revenue growth and continued common share repurchases, which more than offset the impact of lower NII on total revenue. Underlying expenses continued to be well controlled, supported by our ongoing productivity efforts, with first quarter expenses increasing just 1% year-over-year, excluding notable items, even as we have increased the level of investments in our business. Turning to our business momentum, which you can see on the middle of the slide, we continue to make progress across our client franchise in generating better fee revenue growth. Within asset services, AUC/A increased to a record $43.9 trillion. We generated asset servicing AUC/A wins of $474 billion in Q1, supported by key wins in both North America and Europe. Servicing fee revenue wins totaled $67 million. After hitting our full-year sales target of $300 million in 2023, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our increased servicing fee revenue sales go of $350 million to $400 million in 2024. Our priority to grow fee revenue this year is underpinned by a strategy of leading with service excellence and driving stronger back office sales, differentiating with our State Street Alpha and private markets platforms. Our two new Alpha mandate wins this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute on the strategy, while also showcasing the clear competitive advantage and differentiation that Alpha creates for our business. For example, both Alpha mandate wins this quarter include back office services, which can install quickly, allowing us to realize revenue faster. Further, one mandate is our second Alpha for private markets win, a key growth area for us. Encouragingly, both of these Alpha wins were takeaways from a key competitor, with one of the wins having no existing services with State Street prior to becoming an Alpha client, and the other a shared client that will now consolidate back office with State Street. Within markets and financing, even as low FX volatility created a headwind for the industry in the first quarter, we attracted higher FX client volumes, both sequentially and year-over-year, supported by our market-leading and wide-ranging FX trading solutions. In FX, we were pleased to see higher client volumes in the 8% Q-over-Q fee revenue growth. We also expanded our markets franchise. Within outsourced trading, we continue to expand our product capabilities in geographical reach completing the acquisition of CF Global Trading in Q1. Global Advisors perform well, buoyed by higher equity markets, the strategic actions we have taken to position our asset management business for growth, and the benefits of the strong finish in step-off point at year-end 2023. 1Q 2024 management fees of $510 million are the highest since the first quarter of 2022. While GA experienced total aggregate outflows in Q1, this was driven by the impact of a large, but expected single client redemption within the institutional business. We saw continued momentum in the defined contribution business driven by our target day franchise. Encouragingly, we saw cash net inflows of $9 billion in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of positive net inflows of our cash business. ETF AUM reached a record $1.4 trillion at quarter end with GA continuing to gather net inflows and expand market share within U.S. low-cost ETFs. Now let me spend a moment on our continuing productivity efforts. We have a detailed set of initiatives across our business aimed at creating cost efficiencies and lasting productivity improvements. Regarding our ongoing operating model transformation, which forms an important part of these productivity initiatives. As you know, we are streamlining our operating model in India, and last quarter we consolidated our first operations joint venture in the country. I am pleased to note that the consolidation of our second operations joint venture in India closed on April 1. Combined, these two consolidations will propel the continued end-to-end transformation of our global operations and enable State Street to unlock productivity savings in the years ahead as we simplify our operating model. Before I conclude my opening remarks, I would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength. Total capital return amounted to $308 million in the first quarter, consisting of common share dividends and share repurchases. I would highlight that we have returned a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders in recent quarters, with total capital return over the last six quarters equivalent to almost 30% of State Street's total market cap at quarter end. As we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return this year, as we have outlined previously, it remains our intention to return approximately 100% of earnings in 2024 in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, we have delivered a strong start to the year as demonstrated by both sequential and year-over-year total fee revenue growth, encouraging business wins, strong underlying expense discipline, and continued capital return. As we look ahead, we remain highly focused on the execution of a set of clear strategic priorities for 2024. These strategic priorities are backed by detailed action plans aimed at driving growth across each of our business areas. Underpinning this execution is a set of business investments paired with a comprehensive set of productivity initiatives aimed at driving longer-term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and generating positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Now let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Yes, Glenn, It's Ron. So we've tried to be quite clear above what we're doing over at SSGA. I mean, first is around continuing to grow the ETF franchise. As you know, our legacy strength is in the institutional business, where we continue to be quite strong, and we've focused a lot over the last several years on growing the low-cost ETF franchise, which tends to find its way into retail portfolios through intermediaries. That led to the repricing initiative that we did last year, which in retrospect is proven to be quite a smart move because the market share has gone up and those portfolios tend not to move, these are buy and hold investors. So ETFs would be one and then we continue to grow the active space, typically with working with very close partners of ours, and we see a lot of runway inactive. And then finally, fixed income, particularly out, we have a strong fixed income offering here in the U.S., and we've built it out quite a bit in the last couple of years in Europe, and you're seeing lots of strength in the ETF ecosystem in Europe. Second area of growth is really trying to leverage the institutional client base, because its legacy is the passive index business. If we have an institutional relationship, we tend to be the number one or number two manager on their platform. That leads you, that gives you a seat at the table and we believe it gives us an ability to potentially distribute other, kinds of, products and services. So that's where a lot of our focus is now on the institutional business. And then finally, continuing to deepen. We have a global franchise, but there's areas that we can deepen it more. You've heard us talk about Europe, and we're focused just as much on Asia Pacific as those markets continue to grow, and we're able to leverage the positions we have, but really focusing on deepening as opposed to broadening geographic reach. So that in a nutshell is how we're thinking about it, and we're pleased with how it's playing out. Yes, Alex, it's Ron here. I think it's good to focus on what we said here because we've talked to you and your colleagues just about ongoing productivity improvement. We've been at it for years. And we do believe this unlocks a potential, not a potential, but a new wave of productivity growth. And why is that? Well, firstly, almost by definition, if you're taking these ventures on, you're eliminating the margin that was in it, that was in our expenses, that now comes out, right? So you've got that as a near immediate tailwind. But more importantly, and more important for the long-term, is that we can really complete and take advantage of true end-to-end process improvement and simplification. We had created through the JVs, which go back to the early days of our off-shoring journey. We created a lot of complication. Unintentionally, we created a lot of complication. This enables us to get at that. The work has already started. Our operations folks are spending a lot of time in India there. They've done some recent hiring and brought on some great leadership there. So if you think about the importance of India to our operations and, you know, the amount of work that passes through there, between this end-to-end simplification, this ability to eliminate checkers of checkers of checkers and all those kinds of things, we see an enormous amount of opportunity to improve. And then finally, as we continue our technology investment, a lot of that will be directed there. It'll be directed at some of the things that, you know, in the past you would have said, well, let's take advantage of labor arbitrage. And now the technology is at a cost level where we can simply eliminate the labor and not have, particularly for some of these repetitive kinds of tasks between machine learning and other kinds of AI that you can use to replace labor. And you end up then with a one -- a lower labor cost, but more importantly, you've got job content that's very attractive to people, and people want to make careers here as opposed to feeling like they're stuck in this dead-end repetitive task. So we are very optimistic about this. Brian, it's Ron. I mean, we've talked about the private businesses being a double-digit growth business. We stand by that. We see lots of potential growth. Private markets, Alpha is developing nicely for us, largely for some of the -- for many of the same reasons that Alpha itself has. It's an opportunity as these firms become more complex, have complex operating and technology stacks. It's a way to not just lower some costs, but improve operations and future-proof operations. So it's developing well. So we remain optimistic about it. We can. Yes. Ken, why don't I start here? The transition, I know it feels like it's been going on forever, but that will basically abate. And the effect of that will go away, more or less go away next year, assuming no other changes on the client side. So a headwind goes to zero. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, you've seen -- you saw the sales performance last year. You're seeing the sales performance this year that's building up the to be installed business. That still remains very, very high for us. Part of it is some complicated kinds of Alpha clients that they will install, they are installing -- they typically tend to install in waves and tranches. So we'll make progress against that. But I would note from sales performance last year and it continued in the quarter, there's a fair amount of back office in some of these recent sales, which just installs faster. And so we're quite optimistic about the opportunities here in fee revenue growth, particularly servicing fee revenue growth as you overcome headwinds, but more importantly, start to reap the benefits of what we've sold in Alpha, what we sold in back office and get those installed. Yes. Ken, I mean, I think what you should have heard from us today is that we have a sales target that we talked about in January, we're standing by that sales target. That's significantly up from last year, which was significantly up from the year before. So I mean you get there because of the pipeline. So we're encouraged by our pipeline. Well, thanks to all of you on the call for joining us."

            "name": "Eric Aboaf",
            "content": "Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide four, I'll begin my review of our first quarter financial results, which included a $0.32 EPS impact from an additional FDIC special assessment, as described within the notable items table on the right of the slide. As Ron noted, we produced a strong start to the year. On the left panel, you can see that total fee revenue was up both sequentially and year-on-year. Relative to the year-ago period, we delivered robust management fee growth, higher front office software and data revenue, and servicing fee growth, while underlying expenses were well controlled. As I mentioned during the first quarter, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $27 million, largely due to two CRE names. All told, we generated both positive total and fee operating leverage relative to the year ago, excluding notable items. We also delivered solid year-on-year EPS growth of 11%, excluding notable items, which was supported by the continuation of our share buybacks in the first quarter. Turning now to slide five. We saw period end AUC/A increase by 17% on a year-on-year basis and 5% sequentially to a record level. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end market levels, net new business and client flows. I would note that we have seen a mixed shift into cash and cash equivalents with an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points of total AUC/A versus a year ago. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased primarily due to higher period end market levels and client flows. As global advisors, period and AUM also increased to a record level, up 20% year-on-year, largely reflecting higher period end market levels and net inflows, and up 5% sequentially, primarily due to higher period end market levels. At the right center of the slide, the market volatility indices provide a useful indicator of client transactional activity that drives servicing fees, spreads in FX trading, and specials activity in agency lending. Turning to slide six, on the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average market levels, partially offset by pricing headwinds, a previously disclosed client transition, and lower client activity and adjustments, including changes in certain client asset mix into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the pace of installation started slower than we expected in the first quarter. Let me dimension some of these items for you. As I've told you before, the impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth. In addition, lower client activity and adjustments, including the client asset mix shift to cash, was also a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth this quarter, some of which we believe is cyclical. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 1%, primarily as a result of higher average market levels, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments, including the changes to certain asset mix and pricing headwinds. On the bottom of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. In the first quarter, we generated $67 million of servicing fee wins, nicely spread across both North America and Europe. As you recall, solid sales in North America like this was one of the goals that we had described at a conference last fall. In addition, we had $291 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end, up $71 million year-on-year, and $21 million quarter on quarter. We also had $2.6 trillion of AUC/A to be installed at period end. Turning now to slide seven, first quarter management fees were up 12% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average market levels and net inflows from the prior periods, partially offset by the impacts of the strategic ETF product suite repricing initiative. Related to the prior quarter, management fees were up 6%, due to similar reasons, partially offset by lower performance fees. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, following record inflows in 4Q ‘23, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, the overall flows were relatively flat in first quarter. Our spider portfolio, U.S., low-cost suite achieved continued market share gains driven by net inflows of $13 billion. In our institutional business, we saw first quarter net outflows of $19 billion, primarily driven by a single client. That said, we saw continued momentum in the U.S.-defined contribution area with record AUM of approximately $730 billion. Lastly, in our cash franchise, we saw first quarter net inflows of $9 billion, the fourth consecutive quarter of positive net flows into cash. Turning now to slide eight, first quarter FX trading services revenue was down 3% year-on-year, but up 8% sequentially. Relative to the year ago period, the decrease was mainly due to lower spreads associated with subdued FX volatility, partially offset by higher volumes as client engagement increased across nearly all of our FX venues. Quarter-on-quarter, the 8% revenue increase primarily reflects higher volumes with particular strength in our EM business, as well as higher direct FX spreads. First quarter securities' finance revenues were down 12% year-on-year, mainly due to lower agency balances and lower spreads, primarily associated with significantly lower industry specials activity. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, we have seen agency lending balances up as demand is rising. Software and processing fees were up 25% year-on-year in Q1, largely driven by higher revenues associated with CRD, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Quarter-on-quarter, software and processing fees declined 13%, primarily due to our lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by higher lending-related fees. Finally, other fee revenue for the quarter increased $5 million year-on-year. Sequentially, other fee revenue increased $17 million, largely driven by an episodic currency devaluation in the prior quarter, which did not occur. Moving to slide nine, you'll see on the left panel that first quarter, front office software and data revenue increased 32% year-on-year, primarily as a result of continued SAS implementations and conversions, driving higher professional services and software enabled revenue growth. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was down 20%, primarily driven by lower on-premise renewals and installations. Turning to some of the Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we were pleased to report two additional Alpha wins, including our second Alpha for Private Markets mandate. In addition three mandates went live in the first quarter, bringing the total number of live mandates to 21. First quarter ARR increased 19% year-on-year, driven by over 20 SAS client implementations and conversions over the last year. Turning to slide 10, first quarter NII decreased 7% year-on-year, but increased 6% sequentially to $716 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to deposit mix shift and lower average non-interest bearing deposit balances, partially offset by the impact of higher average interest rates, client lending growth, and investment portfolio positions. We were pleased to report a sequential increase in NII, which was primarily driven by higher investment securities yields, an increase in average interest-bearing deposits, and loan growth, partially offset by the decline in average non-interest-bearing deposits. The NII results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected, primarily driven by strength in both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit balances towards the end of the quarter. While it is difficult to forecast the path of deposits in the current environment, we're pleased with the success that we are having in engaging our clients. On the right of this slide, we provide highlights from our average balance sheet during the first quarter. Average deposits increased 4% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by client-balanced growth across the interest-bearing deposit stack, partially offset by a reduction in non-interest-bearing deposits. Average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased by less than $3 billion quarter-on-quarter. Cumulative U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 80% since the start of the current rate cycle with cumulative foreign currency betas for the same period continuing to be lower in the 30% to 60% range depending on currency. Turning to slide 11, first quarter expenses excluding notable items increased barely 1% year-on-year as we both invested more to fuel fee growth and increased the size for our productivity and optimization savings efforts by more than 50%. On a line-by-line basis, excluding notable items, on a year-on-year basis, compensation employee benefits decreased 3%, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation and salaries, as well as a decline in contractor spend that was partially driven by the consolidation of one of our operations joint ventures in India. Information systems and communications expenses increased 4%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the optimization savings and vendor savings initiatives. Transaction processing increased 4%, mainly reflecting higher broker fees due to increased global market volumes. Occupancy increased 10%, partially due to the real estate costs associated with the consolidation of the joint venture in India, which used to form part of the contractor cost within compensation and benefits, partially offset by footprint optimization. And other expenses increased 5% largely due to the timing of foundation funding. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on our transformation efforts. If you recall, consolidating the first operations joint venture last October increased our FTE headcount as we insourced those capabilities. However, it also came with an expected financial benefit excluding integration costs of $20 million over the course of the year. As Ron mentioned, the consolidation of our second operations joint venture in India closed on April 1. And this will also come with an increase in additional headcount from 2Q, as well as expected financial benefits. The consolidation of these two joint ventures will be a catalyst for the next phase of State Street's global operations transformation and enable us to create a second wave of service improvements and productivity savings next year. Moving to slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we detail the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, our capital levels remain well above the regulatory minimums. While we continue to focus on optimizing our capital stack, the strength of our capital position enables us to extend our balance sheet to support our clients. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.1% was down approximately 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the expected normalization of RWA. The LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 107% and 130% of State Street Bank and Trust. Our exceptionally strong liquidity metrics benefit from the deep and diversified nature of our funding base and active balance sheet management. In the quarter, we were pleased to return $308 million to shareholders, consisting of $100 million of common share repurchases and $208 million in declared common stock dividends. As Ron noted, we continue to expect to return around 100% of earnings to shareholders this year. In summary, we're quite pleased with the quarter. We have a clear strategy for growth, a detailed set of priorities that we are executing against in order to drive continued positive both business momentum and expect to deliver increased fee operating leverage this year, excluding notable items. Finally, let me cover our full-year and second quarter outlook, which I would highlight continues to have the potential for variability given the macro environment we're operating in. In terms of our current assumptions, as we stand here today, we're assuming global equity markets flat to first quarter end for the remainder of the year, which implies daily averages up 5% quarter-on-quarter in 2Q and up around 17% for the full-year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve, which I would note continues to move while we expect FX market volatility will remain muted. Given our strong start to the year and higher average market levels, we think total fee revenue for the full-year will now be at the higher end of our prior guide of up 3% to 4% year-on-year, so up a solid 4%, which is better than our previous outlook. There are, however, episodic and industry headwinds impacting our servicing business this year, including a previously disclosed client transition and the impact of client activity and adjustments, which includes the client asset makeshift into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. We believe some of these factors are cyclical in nature, and we expect to offset a portion with higher sales and additional management actions this year. Turning to NII as a result of our first quarter outperformance, strong deposit growth and the improved interest rate outlook, we now expect full-year NII will be down approximately 5% year-on-year, which is better than our previous guide of down approximately 11%. On expenses, we expect full-year expenses, ex-notables, will be roughly in line with our prior guide of up about 2.5%, but with the potential for some additional revenue-related costs this year. Given our improved outlook, we now expect to deliver additional positive fee operating leverage for the full-year, excluding notable items. Finally, turning to 2Q on a quarter-on-quarter basis and excluding notable items, we would expect total fee revenue to be up 1.5% to 2%, NII to be down 2% to down 5% and expenses up about 2% to 2.5%, excluding the seasonal compensation expenses in 1Q and notable items. We think the provisions for credit losses could be in the $15 million to $25 million range in 2Q, and we would expect to have a better view on that later in the quarter as we continue to monitor our portfolio. Lastly, we expect 2Q tax rate to be approximately 22%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Brennan, it's Eric. You know, there are a number of factors that drove the upswing in NII into the first quarter. The bulk of that was actually deposit balances coming in stronger than we had expected, both on the interest-bearing side across the stack and non-interest-bearing as well. That made up for the $30 million uptick in the -- in terms of our results relative to our expectation. The repo balances did tick up as well. They were a small part, but worth in NII terms, about a percentage point of more NII than we had expected. And I think what we're seeing is that as the conditions in the economy continue to evolve, clients are holding more cash on their balance sheets, or then putting that into a variety of different instruments. Sometimes it's on deposits, sometimes it's on sweeps, and sometimes it's in repo. And that's also been, in particular on the repo side, been aided a bit by the reduction in the feds overnight repo operation. So it's really a mix of factors that we're seeing, which together though are driving a better NII performance, which we're pleased with. Sure, Brennan, it's Eric again. The previously announced client transition that we had referenced is in line in terms of amounts that we had expected. If you recall, we had said it would be worth about 2 percentage points of servicing fees this year, which is about a percentage point of total fees. And remember, if you go back to our original disclosure over the last couple of years, we had described the total amount to be worth about 2 percentage points of total fees. And we're seeing about half of that come through on a year-on-year basis this quarter and for this year. And so, you know, fully in line with what we had previously described. Sure. Glenn, we've been heavily engaged with our clients over the last year, I'd say, year and a half, as we've seen, you know, quite a shift in the industry environment and, you know, the evolution of deposits in the banking system. I'd answer your question in a -- at a couple different levels. I think first, going into this year, we had expected total client deposit balances in the $200 billion to $210 billion. And we now see that in the $210 billion to $220 billion for this quarter, And to be honest, we expect that we continue at around that level. And a lot of that is both the engagement that we've had with clients. They all have cash and we certainly encourage them to bring it to us. And part of that is the way we think about client relationships, client profitability, the client services that we can offer. And so I think some of what you're seeing here in the higher aggregate levels of deposits is due to our management action. You know, I think in addition to that, there do tend to be somewhat higher deposits in the banking system. So the tide has been gently rising, I'd say very gently, and that's been helpful. And we expect that to be relatively neutral going forward, but we'll obviously need to see based on the actions, the various actions at the Fed and how they evolve. Alex, it's Eric. You know, we're going to continue to see some of the trends that we have been seeing, and it's just a matter of how the various pieces, you know, partially or fully offset each other over time. You know, we're going to continue to see a tailwind from the level of rates, at least given the current forward curve, because that plays through the investment portfolio and gives us a tailwind, as does some continued growth in lending. The headwind that we've been navigating through, which I would describe comes in steps, and sometimes it's a step down, sometimes half a step back up, is around the deposit levels across the interest-bearing stack, where we're just seeing deposits, I think, at nice levels, to be honest, while we continue to see the grind down of non-interest bearing deposits. And we do expect another quarter of that non-interest bearing deposits to trend down and then to flatten out in the second-half of the year. I think, so you'll see those trends continue. I think you'll -- we'll see where we come out. But you know, if you take our guide together, we expect a modest step down into the second quarter, and then we see a leveling off in the third and fourth quarter of our NII. I think in the past we've talked about being in a range of $500 million to $600 million a quarter. We're now seeing and expect to be comfortably above the $600 million per quarter range. But it's those factors as headwinds and tailwinds that'll play through, that'll kind of dictate exactly where we come out. But I think as I said earlier, the level of client engagement that we've had in terms of putting deposits with us, putting deposits at different price points with us. Some of those are the core transactional deposits that need to support custody accounts, and some of those are the discretionary amount of deposits. It's been a real priority for the franchise and I think one that we've shown some good success in. And that's really creating, I think, this better expectation than we had earlier signaled at the beginning of the year, and one that we think will endure and then, you know, provide the stability and over time upside in NII in the coming years. No, it was sequential for every one of those as you look forward. So it was all on a 1Q to 2Q basis. What I described is a flatter second-half of the year. And so, you know, there are different paths here, to be honest. And it really will just depend on the level of deposits, the level of interest rates, just how the pale of some of the climate deposit or pricings that we've described come through, or the back end of those. So I gave some, you know, a high level view, but Brian, I think there's a range of scenarios. But we do have some confidence in the expectation that in aggregate, NII will be down 5% from a full-year basis, and that's quite a bit better than the down 10% that we had previously guided towards. No, let me try to clarify. We expect total NII to be down 5% on a year-on-year basis for the full-year. What I did say is that we expect NII to be in 3Q and 4Q to be roughly the same, to be flattish between those two quarters. And so, you know, now the question is exactly how much does it come down in second quarter, and then from second quarter into the combination of third and fourth quarter, how much does that come down? And there is a range of different scenarios I think you could foresee. But the reason we're trying not to over-spec the exact quarter by quarter by quarter by quarter expectation is there's just underlying volatility out there in the kind of macroeconomic conditions in the risk on risk off sentiment in the central bank's actions right. And then in our client deposit levels. And so hopefully that gives you enough context to go on. David, it's Eric. We gave guidance at the beginning of the year on a full-year basis purposely, right, because each quarter there's going to be a different set of variables as we navigate through. So we described capital return in aggregate to be around total earnings for the year and we reaffirmed that in our prepared remarks. If you then go into the specifics of the first quarter, remember we had expected a normalization of the lower than usual RWA that came through in the fourth quarter. Some of that is just market factors playing through on the FX book. Some of that is equity markets upticking in the agency and securities financing space. And some of it, to be honest, is just putting capital to work with our clients, where we're engaging with them, and that's driving some of the fee revenue growth that you saw. At the same time, our priority is to get capital back to shareholders. We continued our dividend at pace, as you'd expect. We had some buybacks this quarter. If you do the math, that buyback activity will increase going forward for the next few quarters. We also had the new information about the FDIC assessment. And so we had to accrue for that expense instead of returning capital to shareholders for this particular quarter. So anyway, just a way to describe, we're on track with our priority and to be honest, our commitment to get capital back to shareholders in line with earnings this year. And it will just -- every quarter is a little bit different, but I think you'll see that accelerate into the second quarter. I think I need to quickly go back to the January remarks, but we did not update those and -- so I think that's a good place, a good estimate to use for the full-year, the one that you had back on the January call. Yes, that's correct. Yes. Yes, that's correct. We're just kind of moving through this past quarter 1 and quarter 2 between the redemptions, the issuance and redemptions and then literally, the tactical timing of some of the dividends, you've got it right. There's one more quarter of elevation in the $50 million to $55 million range next quarter, meaning second quarter and then it will run at about $40 million a quarter from third quarter onwards. Yes, Mike, it's Eric. Let me answer those in reverse order. On NII, what happened in the first quarter was really higher deposit balances across the interest-bearing stock and even relative to our expectations on noninterest-bearing in March. So that changed in a positive way, created an uplift into the first quarter that we had not expected. The last time we gave full-year guidance on NII was back in January when we expected it to be down, on a full year basis, 10% for the full-year. And it's only today that we've reassessed that. We did not reassess that back at the beginning of March. We reassessed that today. And what we're factoring in is the higher step off, the higher level of deposits with us generally. And the fewer rate cuts that we're expecting from central banks around the world. And so that's what gets us to a better full-year guide on NII. If I then turn to the equity market question, how it factors through servicing fees. We need to be -- we need to go through it in pieces. And so let me start. First, what matters to us is not just the S&P equity index, because we're global, right? More than 40% of our revenues are broad, including in emerging markets. And while the S&P is up year-on-year 28%. The All-World Index is up only 18%, and that's what's more material to our financial statements given the international and global footprint that we have. With that 18%, we'd expect a substantial tailwind of servicing fees on a year-on-year basis and up 4% to 5% range, typically. But it tends to move around. As you said, sometimes there's a bit of timing there. Sometimes there's a bit of mix there and so forth. What we did see that was a headwind to that this year were two things: one was the previously announced client transition, and that was worth about 2 points of servicing fee headwinds; and then we've continued to see a lower -- or I'll describe different level of client activity that was worth almost 2 percentage points of headwind this year, some of which we think is cyclical. Some of that is transactional activity that we've talked about that we tend to get paid for on a unit basis through our fee schedules. And then this quarter, we also referenced the shift to client cash and cash equivalents within the AUC/A stack, which tends to come in at a much lower fee rate for custody and accounting services. And so those were the pieces that went against us. I think the more-than-expected deposits is really driven by two factors. One, is that there tends to be more cash in the system, in the banking system today. We think that's a mix of central bank actions, in particular, in the U.S., the reduction in the overnight repo operation that the Fed is running. That comes back in a way into our clients or into the banking system. And that's been a -- I think that's generally improved liquidity conditions or added to what is -- our very liquid conditions have made them even more liquid. And then the second factor, to be honest, is over the last 1.5 years, two years, we've been very engaged, and I'd say, increasingly engaged with clients on where they put their cash. They put their cash with us in deposits, in repo, in money market, in money market suites, because every one of those areas we offer services to our clients. And I think what we've done over time is sharpened our engagement with our clients, and that's resulted in more cash and deposits with us in a way that we find is healthy, obviously, for our balance sheet. We're always delighted to keep cash, but also helps with earnings and margin and economically. It's a broad question. We've been in an environment, I think, the last four years or so where we've seen pricing headwinds in the servicing business to be roughly in the 2% headwind level. And that's kind of -- that will float around a bit by quarter. It will float around on the margin a little bit by year, but it's substantially below what we had seen way back in 2019. And which was, I'll describe, a bubble of repricing. I described it that way because during this time, we've seen, to your point, a very accentuated rise in inflation. We've now seen a partial reduction in inflation. And that's not really had a large or substantial effect to our general fee rates or our -- or servicing fees. And so it's been -- I think it's not particularly determinative of that. In terms of our fee schedules, you're right, the fee schedules have several components. They have asset-based. There's an asset under custody basis for some of the fees which is about half. There are some transactional fees. There are just some flat fees. There are some per account fees. And those usually end up being negotiated as a package. It's not that when there is a -- when we have negotiations that one particular part of that package is treated very differently. We have large, sophisticated clients. They think of it as a package. And to be honest, they're looking for a fair set of -- a fair amount of fees so that as a partnership, which lasts often 10, 15, 20, in some cases, 30, 40 years, right? That they feel they're getting value and that they feel that we, as a custodian can deliver on what their expectations are. And so it comes to be a reasonable accommodation, I think, in our minds, in their minds. And Ken, it's Eric. I would just add that we've had these client activity headwinds that we described, which is a mix of risk-off sentiment, which has led to lower transactions through the custodial accounts. And then we've described this shift towards a cash mix, right? We don't see those just continuing at the same pace. We see that as somewhat cyclical. You'd expect -- I don't think we generally expect much more cash to be on hand with clients. There are -- I think there's a case to be made that cash levels of client should actually start to get deployed over the next year and could even be neutral or a possible tailwind. So I think we've been going through a bit of a cyclical phase here on those environmental and activity type and mix headwinds. And I think without those, you could then see through to some of what Ron described around sales, installation and the underlying growth of the franchise."
