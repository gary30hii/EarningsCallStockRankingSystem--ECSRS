I'd like to advise all parties that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ann Dai, Head of Investor Relations of Blue Owl. Please go ahead.\nAnn Dai: Thanks, operator, and good morning to everyone. Joining me this morning are Doug Ostrover, our Chief Executive Officer; Marc Lipschultz and Michael Rees, our Co-Presidents; and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company's control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time-to-time in Blue Owl Capital's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We would also like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, available on the Investor Resource's section of our Web site at blueowl.com. This morning, we issued our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and reported fee-related earnings, or FRE, and distributable earnings, or DE, of $0.12 per share. We also declared a dividend of $0.10 per share, payable on March 7 to shareholders of record as of February 28. During the call today, we'll be referring to the earnings presentation which we posted to our Web site this morning, so please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I'll turn the call over to Doug.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported outstanding growth for Blue Owl with AUM growth of 77%, fee paying AUM growth of 60% and revenue growth of 73% for the year, with permanent capital driving 98% of our management fees and robust demand for our income-oriented strategies. We are starting 2022 with strong momentum and high visibility into our future growth.  More broadly, 2021 was an extraordinary year for alternative asset managers, with robust levels of fundraising and investment activity across the space. Allocations to alternatives have continued to rise across institutional and retail investors, driven by a need for yield and demand for differentiated uncorrelated returns. And managers were able to deploy their dry powder across a wide spectrum of investment opportunities, driving record M&A activity for the year.  As a solutions provider to the alternative space, Blue Owl has benefited from these ongoing secular tailwinds, providing the capital that managers require to finance acquisitions in their funds through our Direct Lending business, and the capital that managers need to expand and diversify their platforms through our GP Solutions business.  We closed on our acquisition of Oak Street at the end of 2021, adding a triple net lease real estate capability that further broadens the solutions we offer. I'll discuss our strategic vision for Oak Street in a few minutes. But suffice it to say, we've been running on all cylinders across Blue Owl. We're very pleased with the results we've announced today which cap off the year of growth and transformation for the firm and the industry.  Before I cover business performance, I'd like to spend a moment on a subject that is top of mind for investors these days, inflation and the interest rate environment. Higher than expected inflation has impacted expectations for the pace of rate hikes, driving market volatility and adjusting investors' views on earnings growth for many public companies. For Blue Owl specifically, we anticipate a net positive effect on our business from a rising rate environment. We expect Direct Lending to be a beneficiary of rising rates as investor demand would increase for senior secured floating rate assets. And over time, the effect of rising rates would be positive for the net interest income of our loan portfolios.  For GP Solutions, market volatility should drive demand for products managed by large diversified managers, benefiting the types of firms Dyal has typically taken stakes in. With respect to Oak Street, we believe there will continue to be strong demand for real estate strategies with long-term contractual income that are positively correlated to inflation and backed by investment grade tenants.  Contractual rent escalations are structured into all of Oak Street's triple net leases, and 100% of all operating expenses, including cost increases are borne by the tenant, which further limits the strategies from any adverse effects of inflation.  Moving on to our quarterly and full year results, Blue Owl generated meaningful growth across all metrics, with strong Direct Lending gross originations of 7.6 billion for the fourth quarter and nearly 24 billion for the year. AUM grew 34% quarter-over-quarter to 94 billion, reflecting the Oak Street acquisition and nearly 4 billion of equity raised across the platform.  Pro forma for the Wellfleet acquisition, which we announced this week, AUM would be over $100 billion. On a year-over-year basis, we have grown AUM by 77% and fee paying AUM by 60%. But even excluding Oak Street, we still grew AUM and fee paying AUM organically by 48% and 38%, respectively, year-over-year.  Our fee-related earnings for the quarter reached 165 million, up 17% from the prior quarter as a result of new capital commitments and significant capital deployment. This substantial growth has been reflective of the initiatives we've highlighted over the past couple of quarters; ongoing fundraising in GP Solutions and fundraising in capital deployment, indirect lending across a number of new and existing products. And in the first quarter of 2022, our revenue and earnings will further benefit from the addition of Oak Street. Retail was a meaningful contributor to our results for the quarter. Of the 3.9 billion of equity capital raised during the fourth quarter, retail constituted approximately 40% or 1.6 billion, a meaningful step up from the roughly 1 billion in the third quarter, and 3x the 500 million raised in the second quarter.  While the Oak Street transaction did not close until the end of the quarter, Oak Street raised a further 175 million from retail during the fourth quarter and would have brought our total retail fundraising to roughly 1.8 billion. Annualizing this 1.8 billion quarterly fundraising figure over our September 30th AUM, we are generating 9% organic growth just from our current retail flows, which we think we can grow meaningfully over time. And this doesn't take into account any institutional fundraising, new products that we plan to introduce to the market, or continued expansion of our retail syndicate. This represents the highest level of organic growth from retail that we are aware of within the publicly traded peer group, and these assets are permanent capital.  In January, we raised a further 725 million from retail across Direct Lending, GP Solutions and Real Estate. So we have already made meaningful strides in expanding our retail presence, we are still in the early innings of this initiative. We're optimistic about the future of our retail business, and we continue to invest for growth.  During the quarter, we added to our distribution platform globally, including in Asia. And in January, we announced an agreement to bring access to our retail products to the Canadian market, which is a large market under-allocated to alternatives. We look forward to sharing more developments about our growing retail business throughout the year.  Moving on, I'd like to provide some brief comments on Oak Street, and then I'll end my remarks with a look at the year ahead. We see a terrific growth trajectory ahead for our real estate strategy, given the vast opportunity in triple net lease. Oak Street brings scale and expertise to a fragmented market and they've built a very strong brand in this space. Their products meet an important void in today's market, providing much needed long duration income to institutional and retail investors, while helping businesses unlock value from their balance sheets. And their business fits very well with our platform vision of being a one-stop shop solutions provider.  Looking back at 2021, we have accomplished a great deal in a short period of time, including completing the Owl Rock and the Dyal merger, announcing and closing the Oak Street acquisition, expanding our already robust retail distribution, and further expanding our institutional relationships.  We achieved all of this while maintaining our strong track record and launching new products. Looking ahead, we remain focused on growing our Direct Lending, GP Solutions and Real Estate businesses while evaluating new opportunities organically and through M&A.  Fundraising continues for our GP Solutions flagship strategy, which has reached 6.2 billion of equity committed to the fifth fund to date, keeping us on track to meet or exceed our initial targets. We continue to raise equity across retail and institutional channels for our Direct Lending strategies where, as a reminder, we generally earn fees on total assets which includes leverage.  And as I mentioned earlier, we plan to support Oak Street's existing robust growth trajectory with the resources of the Blue Owl platform, expanding the opportunity set in real estate. Each of these strategies and each new product within them can be meaningful to our growth trajectory. We have a stable earnings base with 98% of our management fees coming from permanent capital. Between new capital raised and the earnings potential embedded in capital that we have already raised, we have high visibility into the drivers of our growth over the next couple of years. And with a current average fee rate of over 1.5% and FRE margins of 60%, the incremental profitability from each dollar of new capital raised and deployed is very powerful.  Finally, let me end by expressing my appreciation for the support that all of our stakeholders have shown us throughout the year. We're very grateful for your trust and partnership. And we look forward to another great year in 2022.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc to give you an update on our Direct Lending business. Marc?\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thanks, Doug. 2021 was a very strong year for Direct Lending volumes across the industry driven by record amounts of LBOs and corporate M&A. Blue Owl's permanent capital base has allowed us to create flexible, creative solutions for borrowers. Combined with our broad network of relationships, this has resulted in a year of record gross originations for the firm.  As you can see on Slide 16, gross originations were 23.6 billion for 2021, including 7.6 billion of gross originations in the fourth quarter driving record net under deployment of 5.1 billion for the quarter. Despite some volatility in December, market conditions remain supportive of M&A activity, and this favorable investment environment has sustained through the early days of 2022.  The trends for this coming year are likely to be driven by a push and pull of a healthy economy, inflation policy changes and supply chain imbalances. However, we ultimately expect the year to remain constructive for credit markets. Direct Lending ended the quarter with $39.2 billion of AUM, reflecting 13% growth from the prior quarter alone as a result of strong capital raising and deployment.  For the year, Direct Lending AUM grew by 45%, driven by those same fundraising and deployment trends. And our opportunity set continues to expand as private market AUM grows, deal sizes increase, and a greater portion of financings get done with Direct Lending firms.  Over the course of 2021, we evaluated over 40 investments with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion and signed or closed on roughly half of them. And we closed on over 100 investments in total across Owl Rock for the year, a sizable increase from the roughly 60 investments closed in 2020.  Performance remains strong with gross appreciation of the Direct Lending products in the mid teens for the year. And we've continued to focus on downside protection, with a weighted average loan to value in the low 40s across Direct Lending portfolios. Our credit performance remains strong, with annualized net realized losses of approximately 5 basis points since inception.  We raised $2.5 billion in Direct Lending strategies during the fourth quarter, of which retail constituted $1 billion primarily for our core income fund, one of our diversified lending BDCs. Also contributing to the fundraising during the fourth quarter were closes on our diversified lending and tech lending products. And in January, the core income fund raised nearly $400 million of capital, over 50% of the retail flows we generate for the month, and we continue to expand our syndicate.  This week, we announced the acquisition of Wellfleet Credit Partners, a CLO manager with over $6.5 billion of AUM as of December 31. Wellfleet will sit within the Owl Rock division, adding to our existing credit capabilities with a focus on liquid performing credit. The additional Wellfleet strong capabilities together with its deep institutional knowledge of the syndicated loan market and strong credit research platform will support the ongoing growth of the Own Rock business.  And in turn, the scale of Blue Owl's platform will provide Wellfleet with additional access to resources and growth opportunities. Our Direct Lending business continues to broaden in scope and size, and we remain optimistic about the growth opportunities we see ahead supported by a robust demand for both retail and institutional investors.  Let me spend a moment on our Real Estate business. We ended the quarter with $15.4 billion of AUM, up 24% quarter-over-quarter. Fee paying AUM of $8.2 billion grew 35% quarter-over-quarter. We saw strong tailwinds by capital raising for the entirety of 2021 with total inflows of more than $1.5 billion in a year where we had no flagship strategy actively raising capital.  Oak Street also had a very strong year from a deployment perspective, with nearly $5.1 billion of acquisitions for 2021, including properties under development. Our pipeline continues to remain robust with nearly $2.9 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract close.  Oak Street continues to see high quality creditworthy companies exploring sale leasebacks as an alternative to more traditional capital raising, and our investors should continue to benefit from that trend. As of today, we've invested more than 45% of the equity of our fifth closed-end fund.  Performance remains strong with a net IRR of 26% on average across our fully realized closed-end funds, and the net lease property fund, our open ended strategy, has returned 20% net since inception. We've continued to focus on strong underlying credit quality in our funds.  And since inception, we have never had a tenant miss a rent payment, go bankrupt or default on a lease. All things we are very proud of. As the year progresses, we expect to launch our sixth closed-end fund and continue to accept capital into our net lease property fund, which saw more than $1.1 billion of inflows in 2021. So with that, let me turn it over to Michael to discuss GP Solutions.\nMichael Rees: Thank you, Marc. As you heard during Doug's comments, the alternative asset management space has continued to expand meaningfully with increased allocations from institutional and retail investors. Our GP Solutions business benefits from these tailwinds as more firms enter our investable opportunity set, and as these managers needs for capital continues to expand.  From a fundraising perspective, our Dyal funds attract LP interest tied to investing and the continued growth of large diversified managers within the private markets industry, as we certainly saw the evidence of these trends across our partner manager relationships with robust fundraising, deployment and realizations.  During the fourth quarter, Dyal was very active, finalizing strong partnerships with top tier private asset managers such as CVC, MBK, Landmark Properties, Warwick REIT and I Squared [ph]. In 2021, we entered into agreements in principle to commit 3.9 billion to six managers across private equity, credit, real assets and insurance and investment pace that reflects the robust opportunity set.  Our GP Solutions business ended the quarter at 39.9 billion of AUM, up 11% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting 1.5 billion of new capital raised and 2.6 billion of appreciation across the portfolio. Year-over-year, we have grown AUM by 52%, driven by 4.5 billion of capital raised and 9.8 billion of portfolio appreciation.  And as Doug alluded to earlier, in addition to the 1.5 billion raised during the fourth quarter, we have closed on a subsequent 400 million of capital as of January 31, bringing us up to 6.2 billion raised for the fifth fund in our GP equity stake strategy. We remain confident in our prior capital raising expectations for this strategy, and anticipate that fundraising will continue through the first half of 2022.  Further, we look forward to launching a follow-on vehicle sometime in 2023, as we become more fully committed in our current fund. We are optimistic about what this next year holds for the GP Solutions business, given the constructive transfer growth we're seeing across the alternatives landscape and the demand we're experiencing for our strategies.  Market volatility and shifts to the status quo create interesting fundraising and investment opportunities across the entire private markets landscape. And we will benefit from that environment as the premier capital solutions provider to these managers.  With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. On our call today, I'll cover some of our accomplishments from this past year, I'll walk through our current results and financial position. And most importantly, I'll take us through what we think we can accomplish in 2022.  As Doug commented earlier, it's been a tremendous year of growth and transformation for our firm and for the industry. Blue Owl came together in May of 2021. And in our short history as a combined firm, we have significantly grown our AUM, permanent capital, revenues and FRE, all of the key metrics that matter. And 98% of our management fees are from permanent capital, as Doug mentioned earlier.  Although we have only been a public company six months, from June 30 to December 31, our AUM has grown 51%, our permanent capital has grown 38%, our revenues have grown 31% and our FRE has grown 27%.  To put some numbers on this, our AUM at June 30 was 62.4 billion. And at December 31 is now 94.5 billion. Our permanent capital was 56.9 billion at June 30. And at December 31 is now 78.8 billion. Our adjusted FRE revenue was 209.8 million for the second quarter of 2021. And for the fourth quarter was 274.9 million. And our adjusted FRE was 130.1 million for the second quarter of 2021. And for the fourth quarter was 165.3 million.  We are very excited and very focused on continuing our double digit growth, both organically and through potential M&A. We have also begun to see the synergies of the Owl Rock and Dyal combinations, and have now added the Oak Street Real Estate business to our platform and are working to expand those synergies.  Okay, let's cover our quarterly results. We closed our acquisition of Oak Street at the end of December. So although you'll see these numbers in our AUM metrics, you will not see them in our P&L results until 1Q 2022. Our fourth quarter had strong double digit growth.  On Slide 11, you can see adjusted FRE revenues of 274.9 million, up 17% and FRE of 165.3 million, up the same 17%, both compared to the prior quarter. As a reminder, our fourth quarter was also impacted by the significant tax benefit I talked about on last quarter\u2019s call.  So what do taxes look like in 2022? To give you some guidance here, it's best to step back and give you a little more color around our structure. Because the merger between Owl Rock and Dyal was a taxable transaction to certain shareholders, Blue Owl now has certain tax benefits that we will be able to use for a number of years.  It's hard to predict what those benefits are year-to-year, but for 2022 you should assume an overall tax rate in the low single digits. And that's for 2023 and 2024, for now we would suggest using a low teens tax rate. Again, taxes are hard to predict. But as we go through the year, we will continue to update you on what future tax rates may look like.  To provide additional visibility into our revenues for the quarter, we experienced strong revenue growth from both Direct Lending and GP Capital Solutions. During the quarter, we booked 23.8 million in catch-up fees for Dyal Fund V from new investor commitments.  Starting off in 2022, new LPs committing to Dyal Fund V will pay a higher management fee during the course of the investment period, instead of paying a catch-up fee at their initial close. So we're not expecting catch-up management fees in 2022. Also, as of December 31, the fee holiday for Dyal Fund V investors ended which will add approximately $10 million per quarter in management fees starting in 1Q 2022.  Finally, as it relates to revenues, we generated annual Part 2 fees from portfolio realizations in our tech BDC of ORTF, resulting in 3.8 million net of performance compensation. We announced the dividend of $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter. This is our third straight quarter where we increased our dividend and represents approximately 85% of DE, which continues to be our dividend target.  Moving on to Slide 12. We reported AUM of 94.5 billion, fee paying AUM of 61.4 billion, total permanent capital of 78.8 billion. AUM not yet paying fees was 11 billion as of December 31. Because we closed the Oak Street acquisition during the fourth quarter and are now including their AUM in our numbers, I'll provide AUM growth both with and without Oak Street.  AUM grew 34% to 94.5 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by the addition of Real Estate as well as by significant deployment of capital in Direct Lending, capital raising across the platform and portfolio appreciation in GP Capital Solutions. If you look at our AUM before adding Real Estate numbers, we grew AUM organically by over 12% quarter-over-quarter.  Fee paying AUM grew 31% to 61.4 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by the addition of Real Estate, significant deployment in Direct Lending and capital raising across the platform. Before adding in the Real Estate numbers, we grew fee paying AUM organically by 13% quarter-over-quarter.  AUM not yet paying fees reached 11 billion, including 6.1 billion in Direct Lending, 2.6 billion in GP Capital Solutions and 2.3 billion in Real Estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling over $140 million, primarily upon deployment for Direct Lending and upon the conclusion of the fee holiday for GP Capital Solutions, which ended this past December 31. And, as I noted on our call last quarter, if our tech BDC were to go public, we expect that to be another incremental $65 million of annual management fees.  As Marc highlighted earlier, we had another strong quarter of deployment in Direct Lending with gross originations of 7.6 billion and net funded deployment of 5.1 billion. That brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to 23.6 billion, with 11.9 billion of net funded deployment. So as it relates to the 6.1 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in Direct Lending, it would take us approximately two quarters to fully deploy this, based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on Slide 21, we currently have over $1 billion of liquidity with a very long dated capital structure. This includes the 400 million unsecured debt issuance we did last week. As it relates to our revolver financing, we have amended and upsized this facility, making an unsecured debt, tightening pricing, upsized from 150 million to 715 million of commitments, and reset the three-year maturity.  Finally, I'd like to take a couple of minutes here to cover a few other items. First, I'd like to discuss our employee stock program. In May of last year, in connection with the closing of our merger, our Board of Directors approved a 100 million share employee program. Under this program, we have issued roughly 45 million shares to date, where about 3% of our share is outstanding.  About 75% of the shares were issued to employees in connection with our merger to reflect their significant contributions and to create long-term employee retention across the platform with a vesting period of generally five years. The remaining amount of shares were issued under two other programs.  First, we recently offered employees a one-time option to exchange existing long dated cash incentive awards issued under previous programs for Blue Owl stock to continue to align our employees with our shareholders and with the management team who own 25% of our stock. Almost everyone opted for Blue Owl shares, resulting in roughly 7.5 million shares issued.  And second, as a result of our normal course year-end compensation process, we issued roughly 2.5 million shares, or less than 1% of our shares outstanding. In trying to provide some level of guidance for you all for how to think about this in the future, we could typically issue about 1% of shares outstanding as part of our annual compensation process.  So to wrap up here, when I think about our growth plans and what we think we can accomplish in 2022, here's how I would frame it out. In 2021, we posted 900 million of revenues when you look at Owl Rock and Dyal combined revenues for the year. In 2022, we believe we can post over 1.3 billion of revenues, which would represent a 45% growth rate in our revenues year-over-year. Okay. Thank you again to everyone who joined us on the call today. With that, operator, can we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. You just got me on that 45% growth. Can you talk about what you think is the contribution maybe from the acquisitions coming onboard relative to what would have only a few months ago been core Dyal and Owl Rock, just disaggregate the 45?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure, Glenn. Thank you very much for the question. So some of the numbers I've put in my remarks just now let's refer back to them just for a second as part of that. So we have about 11 billion of AUM not yet paying fees that we think will generate about 140 million of annualized management fees. And if our tech BDC were to go public, that could be another incremental $65 million of annualized management fees. That's a little over $200 million of annualized management fees, which is roughly half, that's about 20% or a little more than 20% on the 900. And so that gets us halfway there without any equity fundraising across any of our products for the whole year. So you can think of that as almost half of that, or at least a quarter of that is already in the ground and has to get deployed, it has to get put to work, fee holidays have to roll off and the rest is us continuing to grow our business through fundraising.\nGlenn Schorr: All right, cool. Any reason why you would not do the tech BDC? It seems like a no-brainer. I'm just trying to think through the downside of it, why wouldn't it happen?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: There's no reason that we think of today. We want to be careful, because that's an SEC registrant and not provide too much comments here on this call. But there's no reason we could see sitting here today that we wouldn't look at some point in the future to list that vehicle.\nGlenn Schorr: Got it. Maybe I'll just do one more. Your inception today performance across Owl Rock and GP stakes are great. But I didn't see anything on 2021. Can you give us something about absolute and relative performance in 2021?\nMichael Rees: Thanks, Glenn. It's Michael Rees. The GP Solutions business from a performance at the fund level continues to be extremely strong. Our most recent funds are running an IRRs 24% for Fund III and 96% for Fund IV and Fund V is so high, it's not material to report. So on a relative performance basis, our products continue to do exceedingly well. And in a corporate perspective, our fundraising and our market position, again, couldn't be stronger and have probably been enhanced over the last 12 months from the pre-IPO timeframe.\nDoug Ostrover: Marc, do you want to comment?\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. So on the lending side, we had for all 2021 in total across the various lending products mid-teens gross returns. So we were very pleased with the continued performance. And as I did note, credit performance remains a true bright spot, which of course is our core focus. Since inception, we continue at that 5-basis point realized annualized loss rate. So we're very happy with where the results landed.\nGlenn Schorr: All right, great. Thank you for all that.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Glenn. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, everybody. I was hoping maybe we could start with unpacking some of the retail dynamics you saw in Q4 and obviously the guidance and the observations provided so far in the first quarter, I guess. First, it feels like lots of momentum. Can you specifically parse out what ORCIC flows were in the fourth quarter? And then bigger picture as you're looking into 2022, can you help us kind of frame how you think about building that momentum across both the ORCIC as well as the tech fund and integrating Oak Street, a little more color would be helpful?\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thanks, Alex. This is Marc. Let me just start off. So on ORCIC, which, as you know, is in our primary retail product this year, in the fourth quarter alone, ORCIC, we raised roughly $1 billion. So, as you know and look back at the prior quarters, that is a quite substantial continuing ramp, that still with only a couple of platforms really on the wirehouse side that were distributed. And Doug will comment in a minute on the kind of forward thoughts about retail and some of the growth we see. In January alone, we raised $400 million for ORCIC. So we're very, very pleased. I know if you think back to where we were six months ago on this topic, we're already at that level of $4 million a month, which was even above some people's thoughts and expectations about where we'd ultimately get to, and we're still with those two platforms at this moment of any scale. As to 2022 and more broadly tech and other, let me turn it over to Doug.\nDoug Ostrover: Hi, Alex. I don't have any broad projections. But if it's okay, maybe I can take a step back and just remind everybody on the call that we've been at this, the retail space for six years, and I think we built a really strong brand. We had broad distribution. And I think right now we're one of the top players. In fact, I think in credit, we're number two. In terms of resources, we've got a big team, we are covering the largest wirehouses, independent broker dealers, RIAs, family offices, and I don't know the exact number, but I think we're covering well over 100,000 FAs [ph] today. We've got over 50 dedicated professionals in sales and support, and we are continuing to add headcount. We've been active in the U.S. and now we're very active in non-U.S. markets as well. And I think you saw in the last couple of months, we announced an expansion of our distribution presence in Asia and a new partnership in Canada. And as Marc referenced, we raised over 1.6 billion of equity capital across retail this quarter, 1 billion of that was from Direct Lending in our core income fund and almost 600 million in GP Solutions. And if I add in Oak Street, that gets us to 1.8 billion for the quarter. And I think Alan referenced this, but if you think about where we ended September at 83 billion of AUM and you run rate our fourth quarter flows, that's 9% organic growth just from our current retail flows. Doesn't include any institutional fundraising, doesn't include new products we plan to launch. And most importantly, it doesn't include continued expansion of our retail distribution syndicate. Marc said this, but the 1 billion we raised was just from two wirehouses for the quarter. And I can tell you with 100% certainty, we're adding to that syndicate. So flows remain strong. In January, we raised another 400 million for core income fund. And I guess so where does that leave us for '22? One, we think our products are very competitive. Our performance has been really strong. And one of the unique things about our platform is that we focused on the retail investor from day one. Our goal was really simple when we launched, give the retail investor the identical experience as our institutional investor. And I can tell you that's what we've done and that is a story that is clearly resonating with retail. So where does that leave us? We're optimistic as it relates to retail. No big predictions right now. We're going to have a lot more to say about this in the upcoming quarters.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Thanks for that color. My second question is around GP Solutions business. It looks like the pace of fundraising has been a bit slower than we expected. I think I heard Michael, you said $2 billion or so in funds. Now, you still feel optimistic about getting to $9 billion, but I think it's taken a little bit longer. So what's going on, on the ground that perhaps is leading to slowdown relative to maybe the earlier pace of fundraising, and kind of how are you thinking about the opportunity set for the next bit, which I think you said 2023 is now your sort of expectation?\nDoug Ostrover: Yes. Thanks, Alex. As we had reported last quarter, we extended the fundraising for Fund V into Calendar 2022 to accommodate the deployment schedules of the large institutional investors around the globe. It is a very busy fundraising calendar out there, which is fantastic for our GP Solutions segment. Many of our largest partners are raising flagship funds that are quite sizable. And so we're working with our large institutional investors to slot into this first half within their calendar. And because we've been deploying capital all along in Fund V and have a really good substantial base to work off of, we're in no real rush. We will close this thing, as I alluded to, at or even possibly above our targets and pull in the Fund VI fundraise likely sooner than what had been originally provided as guidance before the IPO. So very confident in our momentum and our targets and the pace of deployment across our business. We target about $4 billion of deployment a year. We hit that almost to the penny last year, consistent with prior years as well. So absolutely no change to our business model or our momentum, just allowing the institutional investor to utilize some of their 2022 budget for us.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. Thanks. I'll jump back into the queue.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please state your question.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks. Everyone, good morning. Hope you are all doing well?\nDoug Ostrover: Good morning, Rob.\nRobert Lee: Hi. Just my first question and then maybe going back to GP Solutions, I'm just curious. When you look at your opportunity set out there, has the competitive environment changed at all? Does the Petershill transaction in any way, shape or form kind of change the competitive dynamics when you're looking to deploy capital or not meaningfully one way or the other? I guess that's my first question.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Robert. We're in a really unique spot within the alternative segment in that our opportunity set for deployment is growing faster than we and our peers are raising capital. So unlike other areas, we can be really selective, there's not a large capital overhang or dry powder. And so it allows us to be selective about the managers we partner with and maintain really good pricing discipline, which shows up in our fund returns that I had alluded to earlier. There are really only three major players in this space; ourselves, Blackstone and Petershill. We typically focus on larger transactions where for a number of reasons those two peers cannot typically operate. And our competitive position within that does not change and has probably only strengthened as we've continued to raise large funds; 9 billion for Fund IV and now 9 billion on the cover of this fund. In addition to that, the needs for capital within the larger segment of these private markets firms continue to expand. As the big are getting bigger and the strong are getting stronger, they often need growth capital. And we are -- as the prepared remarks said, we believe the leading provider of that capital for the top 200, 250 GPs in this space. So really good momentum and really proud of the competitive position that the team has created over the last couple of years.\nRobert Lee: Great, thanks. And maybe on Wellfleet, just kind of curious. Obviously, it brings some new capabilities in, but just talk to what kind of flush out, how we should maybe think about it from a financial impact perspective? I know CLOs have more modest fee rating than your average generally, but any color you can provide on that?\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. This is Marc. More than happy to. So Wellfleet, which may or may not be familiar to everyone, is a really outstanding CLO manager in and of itself, $6.5 billion of assets under management. The acquisition of Wellfleet from our point of view or the way I'd suggest that you think about it is really a very tactical and effective addition to our platform. You make, of course, a correct observation about the nature of the fee rates in CLOs. This isn't about our ambitions to get into lots of businesses of that type. But this is a very, very high quality business that directly complements our Direct Lending capabilities. So what this allows us to do is to have a greater, broader and deeper look into the adjacent liquid markets. It also supports the management of capital, the liquid components of our retail products, or of our permanent private for life [ph] BDCs, for example. So it really brings this great synergy of allowing us to continue to execute in the best of class level on our Direct Lending side in our current products, while allowing us to deliver the Blue Owl platform its full support to this very high quality CLO manager. So I think that's the way I would think about it in terms of fitting our system. Financially speaking, a couple of observations. So it's not one way or [Technical Difficulty] exact numbers, but in line with other CLO managers. So in and of itself accretive. And also, as I said, adds capabilities that we would have needed as a firm in any case. So there is effectively what amounts to cost synergy that is not an elimination, but forgoing the future costs that we would have had to absorb otherwise just to create capabilities to manage our current books. So we think it's a very nice tactical and financial addition. Don't think it changes numbers in any material fashion.\nDoug Ostrover: And upon closing, Rob, those numbers will get forwarded into our Direct Lending numbers.\nRobert Lee: Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow up for you, Alan. So I appreciate the revenue guidance. But any update on how we should be thinking about kind of FRE margins heading into next year, kind of any change to kind of your targets or additions?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Rob. No changes to the guidance that I've previously provided on margins, on income to revenue, on G&A. No updates on that. No changes to the previous guidance.\nRobert Lee: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please state your question.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi. Good morning, guys. One more on Dyal Fund V, I think you said last quarter it was 65% committed. So firstly, what is that number now? And if that's the case, and you do 4 billion of deployment again this year, I would suggest you would need more than 9 billion this year. So why not launch Fund VI earlier than 2023? Thank you.\nDoug Ostrover: Yes, very good question. We did have a modest amount of co-investment that sort of brought that number down that was then topped back up by deployment in the fourth quarter. So the percentage deployment of Fund V is relatively in line with that prior number. And yes, we're raising capital throughout the first half and likely to be deploying it. We'll take a brief pause and then be right back on the road. The official launch date of Fund VI is TBD. But your point is very valid that at this deployment rate, we're likely to be in the market relatively soon.\nPatrick Davitt: Got it. Makes sense, thanks. And then second question more on the structural side and index inclusion side. First, I'm sure you've seen you're in the wrong MSCI index, given your market cap. So curious if you've been working to fix that? And second, could you speak to your willingness to adjust the share and governance structure to get into Russell in June? Thank you.\nAnn Dai: Hi, Patrick. It's Ann. So we're very aware about the amount of AUM that follows these indices on a passive and active basis. So we're actively looking at both of those items that you mentioned. And we'll keep you updated as we do that.\nPatrick Davitt: Thank you.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Patrick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nDoug Ostrover: Good morning.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So Patrick stole half my question, but the other half is what is your prospects on moving to a fixed dividend? Just given the consistent and predictability of your earning stream, do you see any advantages there in terms of picking up long only [ph] in passive ownership that's sort of restricted to owning fixed dividend stocks?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Craig. I appreciate that. For the time being for the next several quarters, we expect to maintain a variable that can continue with the target that we've previously stated for distributions of DE. We are evaluating extensively the concept of moving to a fixed dividend. We expect to have more updates for you as we go through the next couple of quarters.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Alan. And just as my follow up, sort of an open-ended question on Owl Rock. So how has the evolving macro backdrop impacted your fundraising prospects across private credit and your BDC vehicles? And it sounded like from your response to an earlier question, ORCIC, it's actually getting better in the first quarter. And so I'm interested in higher rates equate to higher Part 1 incentives and benefits your financials. But is it also [indiscernible] the rotation away from liquid fixed income?\nDoug Ostrover: Yes, it's a good question and I appreciate it. I think it's important to remember what we do. We originate senior secured floating rate instruments. And these are some of the best assets you can have in a rising rate environment. I don't have all the data, but I think -- and we're going to pull this together. But if memory serves me correct, when the Fed has increased rates more than a couple of times in any given period, floating rates, senior secured risk has just been a great place to be. And so what we're expecting with the uncertainty around rates is there's going to be incremental demand for our Direct Lending strategies. And I also think these higher rates will benefit our net interest income over time. On the retail fundraising side, again, we don't want to make any big predictions, but we're seeing consistent flows. The retail market is aware that rates are probably going to go higher, and this is a good place to hide out. So we're really cautiously optimistic about our current syndicate, what we can raise. And as I mentioned, we're highly confident we'll grow that syndicate over time and hopefully we can get the corresponding flows with that.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thank you, Doug.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. You do have a follow-up question from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. I appreciate it. One more quick on the retail front. So you now have kind of four brands with domain and dominance in their own right. What is your go-to strategy now in retail for each product and then for your wholesale? I'm just curious on how you're going to do this. I'm sure this is not the last acquisition you will make either.\nDoug Ostrover: Well, right now, what we are -- we offer a lot of products into retail. There are two types of way to access retail. One is you go in and you do a -- you're raising Fund V and you do a three, four-week fundraise in a large retail institution. What we've been referring to is more of the retail that is continuously offered. Right now, the one fund we have in market that is being offered day-in, day-out every day of the year is our core income fund, which is a Direct Lending strategy. I think over the next couple of quarters, we'll share with you the other strategies that we will be rolling out into retail. We're not in a position to do that right now. But suffice it to say we will be looking to take advantage of our distribution platform and these partnerships we've built with the large retail distributors.\nGlenn Schorr: All right. But no comment under which brand? In other words, I'm sure they're going to be coming with some of your newly acquired strategies. I'm asking, is this a -- is everything going to be called Blue Owl or do they maintain their old brands?\nDoug Ostrover: Oh, I see. Look, for now we are going to maintain our brands. And I think over time, over the next couple of years, we'll roll everything into the Blue Owl umbrella. But for the foreseeable future, we'll maintain our distinct brands.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Thank you.\nMarc Lipschultz: Maybe just a quick addition on this topic of brands and acquisitions. As Doug said, we'll have an arc of time in terms of how we manage the actual brands. But the underpinning point is really anything we do we want to deliver a best of class experience for the investors. First and foremost, every time we ought to really be talking about how do we deliver that great experience? And that's why we've really built the businesses in very kind of deep fashion in adjacent spaces, right. The market leading business with exceptionally attractive returns in GP Solutions, market leading business in Direct Lending, best of breed risk return solutions, with Oak Street, the market leader in triple net lease solutions for investment grade counterparties, and continuing to grow and evolve from there. So to us, again, we'll continue to evolve the exact marketing strategy and brand strategy. But I think what you really ought to take away is what you'll continue to see from us is that kind of depth and really focus on being best of breed and delivering for our investors, which will allow us to deliver best of breed FRE growth and revenue growth for our stockholders. In terms of additional acquisitions embedded in your question, again, I want to amplify. We're not looking to be all things to all people. We're looking to be really great at a handful of adjacent products that create this ecosystem of private capital solutions for private capital users. So certainly, we get approached all the time. We'll continue to look at acquisitions. But I think we want to calibrate this properly. You should expect when we do do acquisitions, they're really very strategic to build it around this ecosystem so that we can deliver these great results, and again deliver great growth and returns for our shareholders.\nOperator: Your next follow-up question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please state your question.\nPatrick Davitt: Thank you for the follow up. A quick one on the performance fee. Should we expect more of those or is that pretty idiosyncratic? And I assume there was no performance fee in the $1.3 million guide.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: There is no performance fee in the $1.3 billion guide. So that was a Part 2 performance fee from our tech BDC. You could expect -- and that's calculated annually, not quarterly like the Part 1 fees. So you could expect very, very small potential Part 2 fees that we take in each fourth quarter. It's really rounding out as you can see from the number here, but you could expect potentially some each of 4Q each year.\nPatrick Davitt: Got it. Thanks.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Of course. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next follow-up question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Thank you for the follow up as well. I had a big picture question around origination and dynamics get in this sort of current market backdrop. We've obviously seen pretty materials top and net originations in both third quarter and fourth quarter out of your Direct Lending business. But given the environment, curious how you are seeing the spot activity today and your ability to deploy capital sort of at the same pace as we've seen recently?\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes, more than happy to chat about that. So as you did observe origination activity in the third and fourth quarter, it was extraordinary and appealing. And frankly, more indicative than not I think of what we expect. Let's set aside any given week, month, quarter. But in terms of the pace of deployment, remember, we're now sitting with $2 trillion in dry powder and private equity. That will get deployed and it will require private capital solutions. And frankly, our solutions I think in Blue Owl and Owl Rock, in particular, in terms of our share, but more generally, private lenders clearly picking up substantial share. So when there's volatility in the markets, it sometimes causes some slight pauses. Activity continues to be strong. Again, those were exceptionally strong and busy quarters. But overall, when we look at the pace of deployment through the course of last year, if I think about the quarter rise, in total, they took the whole year and just divide that by four. That feels like a very reasonable pace to us over the arc of time. Again, there'll be little variances here and there, but we continue to be busy. I think others continue to be busy. And the built in structural demand quite frankly seems extraordinary. This amount of demand, especially with the ability that we and just a couple others have to deliver the biggest capital solutions, I think is a pretty powerful tailwind for the business for years to come.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next follow-up question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please state your question.\nRobert Lee: Thanks again. Thanks for taking my follow up. I don't think I've heard this many follow-up questions in years on the call. So thanks for your patience.\nDoug Ostrover: We appreciate the interest.\nRobert Lee: Thanks for taking the time. This is another maybe question from Marc on deployment and whatnot. So as your quantum of capital continues to grow at a high rate, can you maybe talk a little bit about where you kind of stand with maybe investing in your kind of funnel, so to speak, or infrastructure, because -- to maintain your own investment discipline, you've got to look at more and more things. And then maybe from there, also talk a little bit about other verticals you may be thinking about. Obviously, the Wellfleet, liquid credit, maybe your thoughts on the non-sponsor part of the marketplace would be great?\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure, happy to. Look, investing in the origination funnel and the ability to thoroughly evaluate credits is the bread and butter of our business. And we continue to invest in that heavily and we will. We have one of the largest dedicated teams for Direct Lending, highly experienced originators, underwriters today and we continue to grow the team. I think we may be up to about 75 and quite rapidly growing, professionals just doing this Direct Lending business. And so I think from that point of view, we continue to see enormous flow. So we're continuing with that same sort of pace you've seen historically where roughly speaking, at the end of the day, it's about 5% flow through from the top of the funnel to the bottom. And we intend to continue to see that kind of flow. We cover about 600 sponsors today. We\u2019ll continue to grow the number of sponsors. Sponsors continue to grow as we have been beneficiaries of in the GP Solutions business for sure. So, candidly, we're always focused on how to see the most opportunities so we can pick the best ones. That 5-basis point realized loss rate, which I think is best to breed, comes from that kind of investment in origination and underwriting. So I think we see plenty of field out there to plow. Again, go back to that $2 trillion of dry powder in private equity and that's a lot of demand. If we just take -- let's just take a simple 50-50 cap structure. That's $2 trillion of new demand on top of refinancing the trillions of dollars that's in the ground. So we -- and frankly, every one of our peers, we're pretty tiny corner of the business today. And maybe what I'll just do is part with this. To a degree anecdote, but it's a little more than an anecdote about the way the market has shifted. If you go back about five years, there really hadn't been $1 billion Direct Lending solution done in the marketplace. This year alone for Owl Rock -- and we're not the whole market. We\u2019re a meaningful part of the market. We're not the whole market. We've seen $40 billion plus financings that we've evaluated, $20 billion of which we've actually [indiscernible]. And so I think that tells you a lot about the way the market is pivoting towards seeing Direct Lending as an attractive solution, even for the biggest and best companies. \nDoug Ostrover: Yes, I'll just make one other comment. So we are going to continue to add resources. We are maniacally focused on that deal funnel. I think we're doing a great job in the sponsor community, the VC community and we're taking a hard look at large private companies as well. We got involved with a dedicated tech lending strategy about four years ago. We saw that as an interesting niche. It's turned out to be much bigger than we ever imagined. We have close to 10 billion of loans in that sector. We have over 20-odd people focused on it. And look, we're constantly evaluating are there other large sizable sectors like technology that we should make a push in? And my guess is over the next couple of quarters, we'll be in a position to start talking about those. So as Marc alluded to, the opportunity set is big. It's growing. And we're seeing just more and more private equity firms and these private companies starting to say, hey, this is a pretty good alternative to the large banks. So we're pretty optimistic about that deployment pace and where we can take the business.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back to Doug Ostrover for any additional or closing remarks.\nDoug Ostrover: Well, maybe we set a record going over an hour. But I want to thank everybody for the partnership and taking the time. I really want to thank everyone for all the great questions. We're available anytime if anybody has any follow up. And our goal is to continue to try to exceed expectations. So thank you, and we look forward to talking to all of you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. On our call today, I'll cover some of our accomplishments from this past year, I'll walk through our current results and financial position. And most importantly, I'll take us through what we think we can accomplish in 2022.  As Doug commented earlier, it's been a tremendous year of growth and transformation for our firm and for the industry. Blue Owl came together in May of 2021. And in our short history as a combined firm, we have significantly grown our AUM, permanent capital, revenues and FRE, all of the key metrics that matter. And 98% of our management fees are from permanent capital, as Doug mentioned earlier.  Although we have only been a public company six months, from June 30 to December 31, our AUM has grown 51%, our permanent capital has grown 38%, our revenues have grown 31% and our FRE has grown 27%.  To put some numbers on this, our AUM at June 30 was 62.4 billion. And at December 31 is now 94.5 billion. Our permanent capital was 56.9 billion at June 30. And at December 31 is now 78.8 billion. Our adjusted FRE revenue was 209.8 million for the second quarter of 2021. And for the fourth quarter was 274.9 million. And our adjusted FRE was 130.1 million for the second quarter of 2021. And for the fourth quarter was 165.3 million.  We are very excited and very focused on continuing our double digit growth, both organically and through potential M&A. We have also begun to see the synergies of the Owl Rock and Dyal combinations, and have now added the Oak Street Real Estate business to our platform and are working to expand those synergies.  Okay, let's cover our quarterly results. We closed our acquisition of Oak Street at the end of December. So although you'll see these numbers in our AUM metrics, you will not see them in our P&L results until 1Q 2022. Our fourth quarter had strong double digit growth.  On Slide 11, you can see adjusted FRE revenues of 274.9 million, up 17% and FRE of 165.3 million, up the same 17%, both compared to the prior quarter. As a reminder, our fourth quarter was also impacted by the significant tax benefit I talked about on last quarter's call.  So what do taxes look like in 2022? To give you some guidance here, it's best to step back and give you a little more color around our structure. Because the merger between Owl Rock and Dyal was a taxable transaction to certain shareholders, Blue Owl now has certain tax benefits that we will be able to use for a number of years.  It's hard to predict what those benefits are year-to-year, but for 2022 you should assume an overall tax rate in the low single digits. And that's for 2023 and 2024, for now we would suggest using a low teens tax rate. Again, taxes are hard to predict. But as we go through the year, we will continue to update you on what future tax rates may look like.  To provide additional visibility into our revenues for the quarter, we experienced strong revenue growth from both Direct Lending and GP Capital Solutions. During the quarter, we booked 23.8 million in catch-up fees for Dyal Fund V from new investor commitments.  Starting off in 2022, new LPs committing to Dyal Fund V will pay a higher management fee during the course of the investment period, instead of paying a catch-up fee at their initial close. So we're not expecting catch-up management fees in 2022. Also, as of December 31, the fee holiday for Dyal Fund V investors ended which will add approximately $10 million per quarter in management fees starting in 1Q 2022.  Finally, as it relates to revenues, we generated annual Part 2 fees from portfolio realizations in our tech BDC of ORTF, resulting in 3.8 million net of performance compensation. We announced the dividend of $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter. This is our third straight quarter where we increased our dividend and represents approximately 85% of DE, which continues to be our dividend target.  Moving on to Slide 12. We reported AUM of 94.5 billion, fee paying AUM of 61.4 billion, total permanent capital of 78.8 billion. AUM not yet paying fees was 11 billion as of December 31. Because we closed the Oak Street acquisition during the fourth quarter and are now including their AUM in our numbers, I'll provide AUM growth both with and without Oak Street.  AUM grew 34% to 94.5 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by the addition of Real Estate as well as by significant deployment of capital in Direct Lending, capital raising across the platform and portfolio appreciation in GP Capital Solutions. If you look at our AUM before adding Real Estate numbers, we grew AUM organically by over 12% quarter-over-quarter.  Fee paying AUM grew 31% to 61.4 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by the addition of Real Estate, significant deployment in Direct Lending and capital raising across the platform. Before adding in the Real Estate numbers, we grew fee paying AUM organically by 13% quarter-over-quarter.  AUM not yet paying fees reached 11 billion, including 6.1 billion in Direct Lending, 2.6 billion in GP Capital Solutions and 2.3 billion in Real Estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling over $140 million, primarily upon deployment for Direct Lending and upon the conclusion of the fee holiday for GP Capital Solutions, which ended this past December 31. And, as I noted on our call last quarter, if our tech BDC were to go public, we expect that to be another incremental $65 million of annual management fees.  As Marc highlighted earlier, we had another strong quarter of deployment in Direct Lending with gross originations of 7.6 billion and net funded deployment of 5.1 billion. That brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to 23.6 billion, with 11.9 billion of net funded deployment. So as it relates to the 6.1 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in Direct Lending, it would take us approximately two quarters to fully deploy this, based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on Slide 21, we currently have over $1 billion of liquidity with a very long dated capital structure. This includes the 400 million unsecured debt issuance we did last week. As it relates to our revolver financing, we have amended and upsized this facility, making an unsecured debt, tightening pricing, upsized from 150 million to 715 million of commitments, and reset the three-year maturity.  Finally, I'd like to take a couple of minutes here to cover a few other items. First, I'd like to discuss our employee stock program. In May of last year, in connection with the closing of our merger, our Board of Directors approved a 100 million share employee program. Under this program, we have issued roughly 45 million shares to date, where about 3% of our share is outstanding.  About 75% of the shares were issued to employees in connection with our merger to reflect their significant contributions and to create long-term employee retention across the platform with a vesting period of generally five years. The remaining amount of shares were issued under two other programs.  First, we recently offered employees a one-time option to exchange existing long dated cash incentive awards issued under previous programs for Blue Owl stock to continue to align our employees with our shareholders and with the management team who own 25% of our stock. Almost everyone opted for Blue Owl shares, resulting in roughly 7.5 million shares issued.  And second, as a result of our normal course year-end compensation process, we issued roughly 2.5 million shares, or less than 1% of our shares outstanding. In trying to provide some level of guidance for you all for how to think about this in the future, we could typically issue about 1% of shares outstanding as part of our annual compensation process.  So to wrap up here, when I think about our growth plans and what we think we can accomplish in 2022, here's how I would frame it out. In 2021, we posted 900 million of revenues when you look at Owl Rock and Dyal combined revenues for the year. In 2022, we believe we can post over 1.3 billion of revenues, which would represent a 45% growth rate in our revenues year-over-year. Okay. Thank you again to everyone who joined us on the call today. With that, operator, can we please open the line for questions? Sure, Glenn. Thank you very much for the question. So some of the numbers I've put in my remarks just now let's refer back to them just for a second as part of that. So we have about 11 billion of AUM not yet paying fees that we think will generate about 140 million of annualized management fees. And if our tech BDC were to go public, that could be another incremental $65 million of annualized management fees. That's a little over $200 million of annualized management fees, which is roughly half, that's about 20% or a little more than 20% on the 900. And so that gets us halfway there without any equity fundraising across any of our products for the whole year. So you can think of that as almost half of that, or at least a quarter of that is already in the ground and has to get deployed, it has to get put to work, fee holidays have to roll off and the rest is us continuing to grow our business through fundraising. There's no reason that we think of today. We want to be careful, because that's an SEC registrant and not provide too much comments here on this call. But there's no reason we could see sitting here today that we wouldn't look at some point in the future to list that vehicle. Thanks, Rob. No changes to the guidance that I've previously provided on margins, on income to revenue, on G&A. No updates on that. No changes to the previous guidance. Thank you, Rob. Thanks, Craig. I appreciate that. For the time being for the next several quarters, we expect to maintain a variable that can continue with the target that we've previously stated for distributions of DE. We are evaluating extensively the concept of moving to a fixed dividend. We expect to have more updates for you as we go through the next couple of quarters. There is no performance fee in the $1.3 billion guide. So that was a Part 2 performance fee from our tech BDC. You could expect -- and that's calculated annually, not quarterly like the Part 1 fees. So you could expect very, very small potential Part 2 fees that we take in each fourth quarter. It's really rounding out as you can see from the number here, but you could expect potentially some each of 4Q each year. Of course. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Marc. As you heard during Doug's comments, the alternative asset management space has continued to expand meaningfully with increased allocations from institutional and retail investors. Our GP Solutions business benefits from these tailwinds as more firms enter our investable opportunity set, and as these managers needs for capital continues to expand.  From a fundraising perspective, our Dyal funds attract LP interest tied to investing and the continued growth of large diversified managers within the private markets industry, as we certainly saw the evidence of these trends across our partner manager relationships with robust fundraising, deployment and realizations.  During the fourth quarter, Dyal was very active, finalizing strong partnerships with top tier private asset managers such as CVC, MBK, Landmark Properties, Warwick REIT and I Squared [ph]. In 2021, we entered into agreements in principle to commit 3.9 billion to six managers across private equity, credit, real assets and insurance and investment pace that reflects the robust opportunity set.  Our GP Solutions business ended the quarter at 39.9 billion of AUM, up 11% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting 1.5 billion of new capital raised and 2.6 billion of appreciation across the portfolio. Year-over-year, we have grown AUM by 52%, driven by 4.5 billion of capital raised and 9.8 billion of portfolio appreciation.  And as Doug alluded to earlier, in addition to the 1.5 billion raised during the fourth quarter, we have closed on a subsequent 400 million of capital as of January 31, bringing us up to 6.2 billion raised for the fifth fund in our GP equity stake strategy. We remain confident in our prior capital raising expectations for this strategy, and anticipate that fundraising will continue through the first half of 2022.  Further, we look forward to launching a follow-on vehicle sometime in 2023, as we become more fully committed in our current fund. We are optimistic about what this next year holds for the GP Solutions business, given the constructive transfer growth we're seeing across the alternatives landscape and the demand we're experiencing for our strategies.  Market volatility and shifts to the status quo create interesting fundraising and investment opportunities across the entire private markets landscape. And we will benefit from that environment as the premier capital solutions provider to these managers.  With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Glenn. It's Michael Rees. The GP Solutions business from a performance at the fund level continues to be extremely strong. Our most recent funds are running an IRRs 24% for Fund III and 96% for Fund IV and Fund V is so high, it's not material to report. So on a relative performance basis, our products continue to do exceedingly well. And in a corporate perspective, our fundraising and our market position, again, couldn't be stronger and have probably been enhanced over the last 12 months from the pre-IPO timeframe."

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Doug. 2021 was a very strong year for Direct Lending volumes across the industry driven by record amounts of LBOs and corporate M&A. Blue Owl's permanent capital base has allowed us to create flexible, creative solutions for borrowers. Combined with our broad network of relationships, this has resulted in a year of record gross originations for the firm.  As you can see on Slide 16, gross originations were 23.6 billion for 2021, including 7.6 billion of gross originations in the fourth quarter driving record net under deployment of 5.1 billion for the quarter. Despite some volatility in December, market conditions remain supportive of M&A activity, and this favorable investment environment has sustained through the early days of 2022.  The trends for this coming year are likely to be driven by a push and pull of a healthy economy, inflation policy changes and supply chain imbalances. However, we ultimately expect the year to remain constructive for credit markets. Direct Lending ended the quarter with $39.2 billion of AUM, reflecting 13% growth from the prior quarter alone as a result of strong capital raising and deployment.  For the year, Direct Lending AUM grew by 45%, driven by those same fundraising and deployment trends. And our opportunity set continues to expand as private market AUM grows, deal sizes increase, and a greater portion of financings get done with Direct Lending firms.  Over the course of 2021, we evaluated over 40 investments with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion and signed or closed on roughly half of them. And we closed on over 100 investments in total across Owl Rock for the year, a sizable increase from the roughly 60 investments closed in 2020.  Performance remains strong with gross appreciation of the Direct Lending products in the mid teens for the year. And we've continued to focus on downside protection, with a weighted average loan to value in the low 40s across Direct Lending portfolios. Our credit performance remains strong, with annualized net realized losses of approximately 5 basis points since inception.  We raised $2.5 billion in Direct Lending strategies during the fourth quarter, of which retail constituted $1 billion primarily for our core income fund, one of our diversified lending BDCs. Also contributing to the fundraising during the fourth quarter were closes on our diversified lending and tech lending products. And in January, the core income fund raised nearly $400 million of capital, over 50% of the retail flows we generate for the month, and we continue to expand our syndicate.  This week, we announced the acquisition of Wellfleet Credit Partners, a CLO manager with over $6.5 billion of AUM as of December 31. Wellfleet will sit within the Owl Rock division, adding to our existing credit capabilities with a focus on liquid performing credit. The additional Wellfleet strong capabilities together with its deep institutional knowledge of the syndicated loan market and strong credit research platform will support the ongoing growth of the Own Rock business.  And in turn, the scale of Blue Owl's platform will provide Wellfleet with additional access to resources and growth opportunities. Our Direct Lending business continues to broaden in scope and size, and we remain optimistic about the growth opportunities we see ahead supported by a robust demand for both retail and institutional investors.  Let me spend a moment on our Real Estate business. We ended the quarter with $15.4 billion of AUM, up 24% quarter-over-quarter. Fee paying AUM of $8.2 billion grew 35% quarter-over-quarter. We saw strong tailwinds by capital raising for the entirety of 2021 with total inflows of more than $1.5 billion in a year where we had no flagship strategy actively raising capital.  Oak Street also had a very strong year from a deployment perspective, with nearly $5.1 billion of acquisitions for 2021, including properties under development. Our pipeline continues to remain robust with nearly $2.9 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract close.  Oak Street continues to see high quality creditworthy companies exploring sale leasebacks as an alternative to more traditional capital raising, and our investors should continue to benefit from that trend. As of today, we've invested more than 45% of the equity of our fifth closed-end fund.  Performance remains strong with a net IRR of 26% on average across our fully realized closed-end funds, and the net lease property fund, our open ended strategy, has returned 20% net since inception. We've continued to focus on strong underlying credit quality in our funds.  And since inception, we have never had a tenant miss a rent payment, go bankrupt or default on a lease. All things we are very proud of. As the year progresses, we expect to launch our sixth closed-end fund and continue to accept capital into our net lease property fund, which saw more than $1.1 billion of inflows in 2021. So with that, let me turn it over to Michael to discuss GP Solutions. Yes. So on the lending side, we had for all 2021 in total across the various lending products mid-teens gross returns. So we were very pleased with the continued performance. And as I did note, credit performance remains a true bright spot, which of course is our core focus. Since inception, we continue at that 5-basis point realized annualized loss rate. So we're very happy with where the results landed. Great. Thanks, Alex. This is Marc. Let me just start off. So on ORCIC, which, as you know, is in our primary retail product this year, in the fourth quarter alone, ORCIC, we raised roughly $1 billion. So, as you know and look back at the prior quarters, that is a quite substantial continuing ramp, that still with only a couple of platforms really on the wirehouse side that were distributed. And Doug will comment in a minute on the kind of forward thoughts about retail and some of the growth we see. In January alone, we raised $400 million for ORCIC. So we're very, very pleased. I know if you think back to where we were six months ago on this topic, we're already at that level of $4 million a month, which was even above some people's thoughts and expectations about where we'd ultimately get to, and we're still with those two platforms at this moment of any scale. As to 2022 and more broadly tech and other, let me turn it over to Doug. Yes. This is Marc. More than happy to. So Wellfleet, which may or may not be familiar to everyone, is a really outstanding CLO manager in and of itself, $6.5 billion of assets under management. The acquisition of Wellfleet from our point of view or the way I'd suggest that you think about it is really a very tactical and effective addition to our platform. You make, of course, a correct observation about the nature of the fee rates in CLOs. This isn't about our ambitions to get into lots of businesses of that type. But this is a very, very high quality business that directly complements our Direct Lending capabilities. So what this allows us to do is to have a greater, broader and deeper look into the adjacent liquid markets. It also supports the management of capital, the liquid components of our retail products, or of our permanent private for life [ph] BDCs, for example. So it really brings this great synergy of allowing us to continue to execute in the best of class level on our Direct Lending side in our current products, while allowing us to deliver the Blue Owl platform its full support to this very high quality CLO manager. So I think that's the way I would think about it in terms of fitting our system. Financially speaking, a couple of observations. So it's not one way or [Technical Difficulty] exact numbers, but in line with other CLO managers. So in and of itself accretive. And also, as I said, adds capabilities that we would have needed as a firm in any case. So there is effectively what amounts to cost synergy that is not an elimination, but forgoing the future costs that we would have had to absorb otherwise just to create capabilities to manage our current books. So we think it's a very nice tactical and financial addition. Don't think it changes numbers in any material fashion. Maybe just a quick addition on this topic of brands and acquisitions. As Doug said, we'll have an arc of time in terms of how we manage the actual brands. But the underpinning point is really anything we do we want to deliver a best of class experience for the investors. First and foremost, every time we ought to really be talking about how do we deliver that great experience? And that's why we've really built the businesses in very kind of deep fashion in adjacent spaces, right. The market leading business with exceptionally attractive returns in GP Solutions, market leading business in Direct Lending, best of breed risk return solutions, with Oak Street, the market leader in triple net lease solutions for investment grade counterparties, and continuing to grow and evolve from there. So to us, again, we'll continue to evolve the exact marketing strategy and brand strategy. But I think what you really ought to take away is what you'll continue to see from us is that kind of depth and really focus on being best of breed and delivering for our investors, which will allow us to deliver best of breed FRE growth and revenue growth for our stockholders. In terms of additional acquisitions embedded in your question, again, I want to amplify. We're not looking to be all things to all people. We're looking to be really great at a handful of adjacent products that create this ecosystem of private capital solutions for private capital users. So certainly, we get approached all the time. We'll continue to look at acquisitions. But I think we want to calibrate this properly. You should expect when we do do acquisitions, they're really very strategic to build it around this ecosystem so that we can deliver these great results, and again deliver great growth and returns for our shareholders. Yes, more than happy to chat about that. So as you did observe origination activity in the third and fourth quarter, it was extraordinary and appealing. And frankly, more indicative than not I think of what we expect. Let's set aside any given week, month, quarter. But in terms of the pace of deployment, remember, we're now sitting with $2 trillion in dry powder and private equity. That will get deployed and it will require private capital solutions. And frankly, our solutions I think in Blue Owl and Owl Rock, in particular, in terms of our share, but more generally, private lenders clearly picking up substantial share. So when there's volatility in the markets, it sometimes causes some slight pauses. Activity continues to be strong. Again, those were exceptionally strong and busy quarters. But overall, when we look at the pace of deployment through the course of last year, if I think about the quarter rise, in total, they took the whole year and just divide that by four. That feels like a very reasonable pace to us over the arc of time. Again, there'll be little variances here and there, but we continue to be busy. I think others continue to be busy. And the built in structural demand quite frankly seems extraordinary. This amount of demand, especially with the ability that we and just a couple others have to deliver the biggest capital solutions, I think is a pretty powerful tailwind for the business for years to come. Sure, happy to. Look, investing in the origination funnel and the ability to thoroughly evaluate credits is the bread and butter of our business. And we continue to invest in that heavily and we will. We have one of the largest dedicated teams for Direct Lending, highly experienced originators, underwriters today and we continue to grow the team. I think we may be up to about 75 and quite rapidly growing, professionals just doing this Direct Lending business. And so I think from that point of view, we continue to see enormous flow. So we're continuing with that same sort of pace you've seen historically where roughly speaking, at the end of the day, it's about 5% flow through from the top of the funnel to the bottom. And we intend to continue to see that kind of flow. We cover about 600 sponsors today. We'll continue to grow the number of sponsors. Sponsors continue to grow as we have been beneficiaries of in the GP Solutions business for sure. So, candidly, we're always focused on how to see the most opportunities so we can pick the best ones. That 5-basis point realized loss rate, which I think is best to breed, comes from that kind of investment in origination and underwriting. So I think we see plenty of field out there to plow. Again, go back to that $2 trillion of dry powder in private equity and that's a lot of demand. If we just take -- let's just take a simple 50-50 cap structure. That's $2 trillion of new demand on top of refinancing the trillions of dollars that's in the ground. So we -- and frankly, every one of our peers, we're pretty tiny corner of the business today. And maybe what I'll just do is part with this. To a degree anecdote, but it's a little more than an anecdote about the way the market has shifted. If you go back about five years, there really hadn't been $1 billion Direct Lending solution done in the marketplace. This year alone for Owl Rock -- and we're not the whole market. We're a meaningful part of the market. We're not the whole market. We've seen $40 billion plus financings that we've evaluated, $20 billion of which we've actually [indiscernible]. And so I think that tells you a lot about the way the market is pivoting towards seeing Direct Lending as an attractive solution, even for the biggest and best companies."

            "name": "Doug Ostrover",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported outstanding growth for Blue Owl with AUM growth of 77%, fee paying AUM growth of 60% and revenue growth of 73% for the year, with permanent capital driving 98% of our management fees and robust demand for our income-oriented strategies. We are starting 2022 with strong momentum and high visibility into our future growth.  More broadly, 2021 was an extraordinary year for alternative asset managers, with robust levels of fundraising and investment activity across the space. Allocations to alternatives have continued to rise across institutional and retail investors, driven by a need for yield and demand for differentiated uncorrelated returns. And managers were able to deploy their dry powder across a wide spectrum of investment opportunities, driving record M&A activity for the year.  As a solutions provider to the alternative space, Blue Owl has benefited from these ongoing secular tailwinds, providing the capital that managers require to finance acquisitions in their funds through our Direct Lending business, and the capital that managers need to expand and diversify their platforms through our GP Solutions business.  We closed on our acquisition of Oak Street at the end of 2021, adding a triple net lease real estate capability that further broadens the solutions we offer. I'll discuss our strategic vision for Oak Street in a few minutes. But suffice it to say, we've been running on all cylinders across Blue Owl. We're very pleased with the results we've announced today which cap off the year of growth and transformation for the firm and the industry.  Before I cover business performance, I'd like to spend a moment on a subject that is top of mind for investors these days, inflation and the interest rate environment. Higher than expected inflation has impacted expectations for the pace of rate hikes, driving market volatility and adjusting investors' views on earnings growth for many public companies. For Blue Owl specifically, we anticipate a net positive effect on our business from a rising rate environment. We expect Direct Lending to be a beneficiary of rising rates as investor demand would increase for senior secured floating rate assets. And over time, the effect of rising rates would be positive for the net interest income of our loan portfolios.  For GP Solutions, market volatility should drive demand for products managed by large diversified managers, benefiting the types of firms Dyal has typically taken stakes in. With respect to Oak Street, we believe there will continue to be strong demand for real estate strategies with long-term contractual income that are positively correlated to inflation and backed by investment grade tenants.  Contractual rent escalations are structured into all of Oak Street's triple net leases, and 100% of all operating expenses, including cost increases are borne by the tenant, which further limits the strategies from any adverse effects of inflation.  Moving on to our quarterly and full year results, Blue Owl generated meaningful growth across all metrics, with strong Direct Lending gross originations of 7.6 billion for the fourth quarter and nearly 24 billion for the year. AUM grew 34% quarter-over-quarter to 94 billion, reflecting the Oak Street acquisition and nearly 4 billion of equity raised across the platform.  Pro forma for the Wellfleet acquisition, which we announced this week, AUM would be over $100 billion. On a year-over-year basis, we have grown AUM by 77% and fee paying AUM by 60%. But even excluding Oak Street, we still grew AUM and fee paying AUM organically by 48% and 38%, respectively, year-over-year.  Our fee-related earnings for the quarter reached 165 million, up 17% from the prior quarter as a result of new capital commitments and significant capital deployment. This substantial growth has been reflective of the initiatives we've highlighted over the past couple of quarters; ongoing fundraising in GP Solutions and fundraising in capital deployment, indirect lending across a number of new and existing products. And in the first quarter of 2022, our revenue and earnings will further benefit from the addition of Oak Street. Retail was a meaningful contributor to our results for the quarter. Of the 3.9 billion of equity capital raised during the fourth quarter, retail constituted approximately 40% or 1.6 billion, a meaningful step up from the roughly 1 billion in the third quarter, and 3x the 500 million raised in the second quarter.  While the Oak Street transaction did not close until the end of the quarter, Oak Street raised a further 175 million from retail during the fourth quarter and would have brought our total retail fundraising to roughly 1.8 billion. Annualizing this 1.8 billion quarterly fundraising figure over our September 30th AUM, we are generating 9% organic growth just from our current retail flows, which we think we can grow meaningfully over time. And this doesn't take into account any institutional fundraising, new products that we plan to introduce to the market, or continued expansion of our retail syndicate. This represents the highest level of organic growth from retail that we are aware of within the publicly traded peer group, and these assets are permanent capital.  In January, we raised a further 725 million from retail across Direct Lending, GP Solutions and Real Estate. So we have already made meaningful strides in expanding our retail presence, we are still in the early innings of this initiative. We're optimistic about the future of our retail business, and we continue to invest for growth.  During the quarter, we added to our distribution platform globally, including in Asia. And in January, we announced an agreement to bring access to our retail products to the Canadian market, which is a large market under-allocated to alternatives. We look forward to sharing more developments about our growing retail business throughout the year.  Moving on, I'd like to provide some brief comments on Oak Street, and then I'll end my remarks with a look at the year ahead. We see a terrific growth trajectory ahead for our real estate strategy, given the vast opportunity in triple net lease. Oak Street brings scale and expertise to a fragmented market and they've built a very strong brand in this space. Their products meet an important void in today's market, providing much needed long duration income to institutional and retail investors, while helping businesses unlock value from their balance sheets. And their business fits very well with our platform vision of being a one-stop shop solutions provider.  Looking back at 2021, we have accomplished a great deal in a short period of time, including completing the Owl Rock and the Dyal merger, announcing and closing the Oak Street acquisition, expanding our already robust retail distribution, and further expanding our institutional relationships.  We achieved all of this while maintaining our strong track record and launching new products. Looking ahead, we remain focused on growing our Direct Lending, GP Solutions and Real Estate businesses while evaluating new opportunities organically and through M&A.  Fundraising continues for our GP Solutions flagship strategy, which has reached 6.2 billion of equity committed to the fifth fund to date, keeping us on track to meet or exceed our initial targets. We continue to raise equity across retail and institutional channels for our Direct Lending strategies where, as a reminder, we generally earn fees on total assets which includes leverage.  And as I mentioned earlier, we plan to support Oak Street's existing robust growth trajectory with the resources of the Blue Owl platform, expanding the opportunity set in real estate. Each of these strategies and each new product within them can be meaningful to our growth trajectory. We have a stable earnings base with 98% of our management fees coming from permanent capital. Between new capital raised and the earnings potential embedded in capital that we have already raised, we have high visibility into the drivers of our growth over the next couple of years. And with a current average fee rate of over 1.5% and FRE margins of 60%, the incremental profitability from each dollar of new capital raised and deployed is very powerful.  Finally, let me end by expressing my appreciation for the support that all of our stakeholders have shown us throughout the year. We're very grateful for your trust and partnership. And we look forward to another great year in 2022.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc to give you an update on our Direct Lending business. Marc? Marc, do you want to comment? Thank you, Glenn. I appreciate it. Hi, Alex. I don't have any broad projections. But if it's okay, maybe I can take a step back and just remind everybody on the call that we've been at this, the retail space for six years, and I think we built a really strong brand. We had broad distribution. And I think right now we're one of the top players. In fact, I think in credit, we're number two. In terms of resources, we've got a big team, we are covering the largest wirehouses, independent broker dealers, RIAs, family offices, and I don't know the exact number, but I think we're covering well over 100,000 FAs [ph] today. We've got over 50 dedicated professionals in sales and support, and we are continuing to add headcount. We've been active in the U.S. and now we're very active in non-U.S. markets as well. And I think you saw in the last couple of months, we announced an expansion of our distribution presence in Asia and a new partnership in Canada. And as Marc referenced, we raised over 1.6 billion of equity capital across retail this quarter, 1 billion of that was from Direct Lending in our core income fund and almost 600 million in GP Solutions. And if I add in Oak Street, that gets us to 1.8 billion for the quarter. And I think Alan referenced this, but if you think about where we ended September at 83 billion of AUM and you run rate our fourth quarter flows, that's 9% organic growth just from our current retail flows. Doesn't include any institutional fundraising, doesn't include new products we plan to launch. And most importantly, it doesn't include continued expansion of our retail distribution syndicate. Marc said this, but the 1 billion we raised was just from two wirehouses for the quarter. And I can tell you with 100% certainty, we're adding to that syndicate. So flows remain strong. In January, we raised another 400 million for core income fund. And I guess so where does that leave us for '22? One, we think our products are very competitive. Our performance has been really strong. And one of the unique things about our platform is that we focused on the retail investor from day one. Our goal was really simple when we launched, give the retail investor the identical experience as our institutional investor. And I can tell you that's what we've done and that is a story that is clearly resonating with retail. So where does that leave us? We're optimistic as it relates to retail. No big predictions right now. We're going to have a lot more to say about this in the upcoming quarters. Yes. Thanks, Alex. As we had reported last quarter, we extended the fundraising for Fund V into Calendar 2022 to accommodate the deployment schedules of the large institutional investors around the globe. It is a very busy fundraising calendar out there, which is fantastic for our GP Solutions segment. Many of our largest partners are raising flagship funds that are quite sizable. And so we're working with our large institutional investors to slot into this first half within their calendar. And because we've been deploying capital all along in Fund V and have a really good substantial base to work off of, we're in no real rush. We will close this thing, as I alluded to, at or even possibly above our targets and pull in the Fund VI fundraise likely sooner than what had been originally provided as guidance before the IPO. So very confident in our momentum and our targets and the pace of deployment across our business. We target about $4 billion of deployment a year. We hit that almost to the penny last year, consistent with prior years as well. So absolutely no change to our business model or our momentum, just allowing the institutional investor to utilize some of their 2022 budget for us. Thank you, Alex. Good morning, Rob. Thank you, Robert. We're in a really unique spot within the alternative segment in that our opportunity set for deployment is growing faster than we and our peers are raising capital. So unlike other areas, we can be really selective, there's not a large capital overhang or dry powder. And so it allows us to be selective about the managers we partner with and maintain really good pricing discipline, which shows up in our fund returns that I had alluded to earlier. There are really only three major players in this space; ourselves, Blackstone and Petershill. We typically focus on larger transactions where for a number of reasons those two peers cannot typically operate. And our competitive position within that does not change and has probably only strengthened as we've continued to raise large funds; 9 billion for Fund IV and now 9 billion on the cover of this fund. In addition to that, the needs for capital within the larger segment of these private markets firms continue to expand. As the big are getting bigger and the strong are getting stronger, they often need growth capital. And we are -- as the prepared remarks said, we believe the leading provider of that capital for the top 200, 250 GPs in this space. So really good momentum and really proud of the competitive position that the team has created over the last couple of years. And upon closing, Rob, those numbers will get forwarded into our Direct Lending numbers. Yes, very good question. We did have a modest amount of co-investment that sort of brought that number down that was then topped back up by deployment in the fourth quarter. So the percentage deployment of Fund V is relatively in line with that prior number. And yes, we're raising capital throughout the first half and likely to be deploying it. We'll take a brief pause and then be right back on the road. The official launch date of Fund VI is TBD. But your point is very valid that at this deployment rate, we're likely to be in the market relatively soon. Thank you, Patrick. Good morning. Yes, it's a good question and I appreciate it. I think it's important to remember what we do. We originate senior secured floating rate instruments. And these are some of the best assets you can have in a rising rate environment. I don't have all the data, but I think -- and we're going to pull this together. But if memory serves me correct, when the Fed has increased rates more than a couple of times in any given period, floating rates, senior secured risk has just been a great place to be. And so what we're expecting with the uncertainty around rates is there's going to be incremental demand for our Direct Lending strategies. And I also think these higher rates will benefit our net interest income over time. On the retail fundraising side, again, we don't want to make any big predictions, but we're seeing consistent flows. The retail market is aware that rates are probably going to go higher, and this is a good place to hide out. So we're really cautiously optimistic about our current syndicate, what we can raise. And as I mentioned, we're highly confident we'll grow that syndicate over time and hopefully we can get the corresponding flows with that. Well, right now, what we are -- we offer a lot of products into retail. There are two types of way to access retail. One is you go in and you do a -- you're raising Fund V and you do a three, four-week fundraise in a large retail institution. What we've been referring to is more of the retail that is continuously offered. Right now, the one fund we have in market that is being offered day-in, day-out every day of the year is our core income fund, which is a Direct Lending strategy. I think over the next couple of quarters, we'll share with you the other strategies that we will be rolling out into retail. We're not in a position to do that right now. But suffice it to say we will be looking to take advantage of our distribution platform and these partnerships we've built with the large retail distributors. Oh, I see. Look, for now we are going to maintain our brands. And I think over time, over the next couple of years, we'll roll everything into the Blue Owl umbrella. But for the foreseeable future, we'll maintain our distinct brands. We appreciate the interest. Yes, I'll just make one other comment. So we are going to continue to add resources. We are maniacally focused on that deal funnel. I think we're doing a great job in the sponsor community, the VC community and we're taking a hard look at large private companies as well. We got involved with a dedicated tech lending strategy about four years ago. We saw that as an interesting niche. It's turned out to be much bigger than we ever imagined. We have close to 10 billion of loans in that sector. We have over 20-odd people focused on it. And look, we're constantly evaluating are there other large sizable sectors like technology that we should make a push in? And my guess is over the next couple of quarters, we'll be in a position to start talking about those. So as Marc alluded to, the opportunity set is big. It's growing. And we're seeing just more and more private equity firms and these private companies starting to say, hey, this is a pretty good alternative to the large banks. So we're pretty optimistic about that deployment pace and where we can take the business. Well, maybe we set a record going over an hour. But I want to thank everybody for the partnership and taking the time. I really want to thank everyone for all the great questions. We're available anytime if anybody has any follow up. And our goal is to continue to try to exceed expectations. So thank you, and we look forward to talking to all of you soon."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ann Dai, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAnn Dai: Thanks, operator, and good morning, to everyone. Joining me today are Doug Ostrover, our Chief Executive Officer; Marc Lipschultz and Michael Rees, our Co-Presidents, and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company's control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in Blue Owl Capital's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. We would also like to remind everyone that we will refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release, available on the Investor Resource section of our website at blueowl.com. This morning, we issued our financial results for the third quarter of 2021 and reported fee-related earnings or FRE and distributable earnings or DE of $0.11 per share. We also declared a dividend of $0.09 per share, payable on September 30 to shareholders of record as of November 22. During the call today, we'll be referring to the earnings presentation which we posted to our website this morning, so please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. It's been a busy few months for Blue Owl, so we're excited to provide all of you with an update on what we've been doing to move our strategic initiatives forward. Before I talk about this quarter, though, I'd like to take a moment to call out the tailwinds that have been present across alternatives, and which have obviously benefited not just us, but our peers as well. M&A activity has been near record levels, driving elevated lending activity across public and private markets. Accommodating equity markets have allowed for sponsors to exit investments and return capital to investors who in turn, putting money back into alternatives. GPs are raising larger funds more quickly and are broadening their investment capabilities to be more relevant to their investors, which drives capital needs across their businesses. The beauty of Blue Owl is that our growth does not take away from the growth of other alternative asset managers, but in fact supports it. We grow with our peers as we lend to their portfolio companies and provide growth equity to the GPs. And we plan to continue expanding our market share, indirect lending and investing in additional premier franchises in GP solutions. Turning to the third quarter, Blue Owl\u2019s strong results reflect continued robust growth for the firm, as gross originations reached a record $8.8 billion across direct lending. And we raised capital across fundraising channels and investment strategies. AUM grew 13% to over $70 billion quarter-over-quarter, reflecting ongoing fundraising across the platform and appreciation in GP solutions. A few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Oak Street, adding another market-leading scaled, yield oriented capability to the Blue Owl platform. Pro forma for Oak Street, our September 30 assets under management would be $83 billion. And I'll touch on the compelling opportunities we see with Oak Street in a minute. Our distributable earnings grew 32% from the prior quarter, as a result of the new capital commitments, significant capital deployment firm wide and a tax benefit that Alan will discuss in greater detail. Our distributable earnings are anchored by the high level of permanent capital across the business, with 97% of our management fees coming from permanent capital. This means shareholders have significant visibility into our existing earnings power, and then we continue to layer on incremental earnings through fundraising and deployment. We think this aspect of the Blue Owl story is powerful. None of our peers look like us with respect to our permanent capital profile, and it allows us to grow faster than our peers. Our focus remains on growing earnings, not AUM. And we will always prioritize profitability and scalability over asset gathering. Last quarter for our inaugural earnings call, we presented the history of the Owl Rock and Dyal businesses, the type of differentiated investment capabilities that each platform offers investors, and how they grew into the businesses they are today.  We talked about the unifying aspects of the firm as they came together under the Blue Owl banner, including one, their positioning as market leaders in their respective spaces. Two, the commitment to creating differentiated yield solutions for investors. Three, the focus on long-dated and permanent capital streams. Four, the notable synergies that we anticipate, as we leverage the power of the combined Owl Rock and Dyal ecosystems. And five, the culture of respect and collaboration that permeates through our interactions with each other, our investors and our counterparts in the market.  And we expect to demonstrate that combining these businesses under one roof will result in greater value creation than each would have on a standalone basis. Said another way, the benefits of the Blue Owl ecosystem should be measurably positive. The steps we are taking today, in building out our investment capabilities, investing in our corporate infrastructure and creating a cross collaboration framework across business lines are creating the runway for continued and meaningful growth ahead. Let me highlight a few things that I think will be important areas of focus for the firm over the coming quarters and years, and then I'll turn it over to Mark and Michael to discuss direct lending and GP Solutions in greater detail. First, I want to spend a minute on our technology lending BDC, which has reached nearly $7 billion of assets under management, and has generated a gross IRR of 23%, and a net IRR of 18% since inception, a strong result for a BDC that focuses on senior secured lending. When we went to market with the strategy in 2018, we have the first tech focused BDC of its size in the space. And it was tough to raise that equity. Tech lending sounded risky to people, and they couldn't imagine our vision, which was a fund focused on making top of the capital structure, senior secured loans to well-established upper middle market technology companies, with mission-critical products and recurring revenue basis. We have been able to construct the portfolio with significant downside protection. And our track record in this product has been terrific, with no losses since inception, and no loans on non-accrual. We think the industry is in the very early innings of the adoption of private credit solutions to technology firms. And we are a leader due to our scale, domain expertise and broad relationships, which we have been developing for many years.  For many of the tech companies to which we lend, we're providing growth capital at an attractive cost relative to raising another equity round. And we can provide bespoke solutions to fit their specific needs. The growth of this tech lending strategy could be very meaningful for Blue Owl over time, and we look forward to providing more updates and future quarters. The next area I'd like to highlight is retail, which has been a primary focus for the Owl Rock team since we founded the business. While retail flows to alternative assets have really begun to accelerate in recent years, we believe retail allocations to alternatives have a lot of room to expand and expect Blue Owl to be amongst the meaningful beneficiaries of this trend. We're still in the very early days of rolling out direct lending, GP Solutions and down the line net lease products to retail, particularly in the wirehouse channels. The early feedback on our products has been very positive, with retail investors appreciating the yield profile we provide for a senior secured product, as well as the fact that they are invested in the same loans as our institutional investors. Our BDCs are compelling alternatives to traditional fixed income products. And as you know, retail allocations to fixed income are very large. For the third quarter, we raised over $1.1 billion of equity capital across retail, with approximately $500 million of that coming from direct lending, and $600 million coming from GP Solutions. And pro forma for Oak Street, our retail fundraising for the third quarter would have been over $1.6 billion, as Oak Street raised more than $500 million from retail during the quarter. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves on the potential opportunity in retail. But clearly, large amounts of capital can be raised in this channel. And we intend to be fully in the mix with a number of differentiated products. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, I'd like to spend a moment on our acquisition of Oak Street, a leading real estate private equity firm, focused on the triple net lease market with over $12 billion of AUM as of September 30. As we detail on Slide 8 of the presentation, we're very excited to have the Oak Street team join Blue Owl. They've built a great business with a market-leading position in net lease, and we expect it to be complementary to Blue Owl\u2019s platform in many ways. This transaction fits the parameters we've been looking for, namely one, an ability for Blue Owl to take a strong industry-leading franchise and leverage our scale and infrastructure to accelerate its already robust runway for growth. Two, a product set that can translate well to both institutional and retail investors, and lends itself to long-dated and permanent capital structures, which net lease certainly does. Three, affirm with an investment focus that does not compete with our existing Blue Owl investment capabilities, but rather is complementary and which has a big addressable market. And finally, we wanted to have the ability to create synergies for our stakeholders in the following ways. This transaction offers our LPs, who may not have known Oak Street or invested in net lease previously, exposure to a world-class investment platform, now supported by the scale of Blue Owl\u2019s infrastructure. And the same is the case for Oak Street LPs, the potential for cross-selling is meaningful, given the limited 3% overlap in our respective LP basis. We also believe Oak Street's net lease expertise can be very beneficial to the sponsors that we work with, in direct lending and our partner managers in GP Solutions. From a retail perspective, we welcome the opportunity to leverage Blue Owl\u2019s broad distribution platform to further expand Oak Street's retail presence across existing and new strategies. And finally, for our public shareholders, we expect that the Oak Street transaction will be 5% to 7% accretive to distributable earnings per share, starting in 2022, based on Oak Street's existing growth trajectory. But as we consider all the things that we can do as a combined platform, the benefit to Blue Owl\u2019s shareholders could exceed that over time. I also like to add that our team has known Marc Zahr, the CEO and Founder of Oak Street for a number of years now. And we have a lot of admiration for the business he's built, and importantly, the culture he's created at Oak Street, which we think is very similar to what we have at Blue Owl. We're excited to share more about the business once the transaction is closed, and to introduce Marc to our Blue Owl stakeholders. Marc will be joining Blue Owl\u2019s Board of Directors and Executive committee, and will play an integral role in the strategic initiatives we have planned. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Lipschultz, to give you an update on our direct lending business. Mark?\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thanks, Doug. Across the industry, we are seeing accelerating use of direct lending as a solution for private equity sponsors and corporations, as they continue to see the benefits of working with one lender. Through that one relationship, borrowers find greater predictability, privacy and partnership, the three P's that make private credit a very attractive alternative to broadly syndicated markets. So zooming in a bit, we really like our market positioning of lending to upper middle market companies at scale, and believe the Blue Owl will continue to take market share over time. Turning to the third quarter specifically, as you can see on Slide 15 of our presentation, our direct lending business saw record originations of $8.8 billion, surpassing the prior record of $5.1 billion from the second quarter of 2021. Market conditions remained very supportive of M&A activity during the quarter, and this favorable environment has sustained through the first part of the fourth quarter. Although it has been just six months since the merger between Dyal and Owl Rock, we've seen concrete and positive impacts to our deal flow as a result. Direct lending ended the quarter with $34.6 billion of AUM, reflecting 11% growth from the prior quarter as a result of strong origination activity. If you go back about five years, I don't think there had been a single direct lending solution of $1 billion or greater. Year-to-date, we have signed or closed on 17 deals with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion. This clearly demonstrates how the addressable market for direct lending continues to expand, as private equity sponsors and private companies value our ability to provide bespoke and flexible solutions and certainty of execution. Performance remains very strong, with a gross IRR of 12% and a net IRR of 9% since inception, at the end of the third quarter for ORCC, our publicly traded diversified lending BDC, and a gross IRR of 23% and net IRR of 18% since inception, at the end of the third quarter for ORTF, our tech lending BDC. We've continued to focus on downside protection, with a weighted average loan to value in the mid-40s in our diversified lending strategy, and a weighted average loan to value of less than 30% in our tech lending strategy as of September 30. And our credit performance remains strong, with annualized net realized losses of approximately 5 basis points since inception. As Doug mentioned, retail fundraising within direct lending was roughly $500 million for the third quarter. We gained even more traction in October, with nearly $350 million raised in this month alone. And we continue to broaden our distribution and evaluate new products for retail. Between retail expansion, new product development, and the strength of our existing platforms, we're very optimistic about the growth ahead for our direct lending business, and look forward to providing updates on new exciting products in the coming quarters. With that, let me turn it to my partner, Michael Rees, to discuss GP Solutions in more detail.\nMichael Rees: Thank you, Mark. We continue to see investor interest in our GP solution strategy, which provides a balance of current income and appreciation potential tied to the continued growth of the industry. And from an investment standpoint, the pipeline remains very strong as firms in the space continue to scale and require substantial growth capital to do so. In the third quarter, we continue to form strong partnerships with top private managers including CVC. We are extremely pleased to be establishing this relationship with CVC, the culmination of six years of productive dialogue and relationship building. They are a true leader in the industry. As of today, we have invested, committed or have agreement in principle to commit approximately 65% of what we expect to raise for our GP minority equity strategy in our fifth fund. Our value proposition of providing passive equity capital to premier managers through minority stakes has continued to resonate in the market. And even in the early days of Blue Owl, the merger between Owl Rock and Dyal, we've created significant touch points that can drive incremental opportunities down the road. Our GP solutions business ended the quarter at $35.9 billion of AUM, reflecting new capital raised and appreciation across the portfolio. Performance remains very strong, with fund three marked at a gross IRR of 33% and net IRR of 25% since inception. And fund four marked at a gross IRR of 140% and net IRR of 86% since inception. What people may not realize about these IRRs is that in addition to the capital appreciation over time, investors are getting cash on cash returns on a regular basis, meaning our LPs are receiving significant amounts of income while their underlying investments appreciate. For example, as of September 30, fund three was closed only in 2016, has already returned approximately 75% of the capital contributed by the LPs in the fund, and we continue to hold the majority of our positions in each of those 10 underlying firms. We think our funds standout in this respect marrying potential for private equity returns with ongoing income generation. We raised $1.6 billion of new capital during the quarter, primarily in our GP minority equity strategy. And we remain confident in our prior capital raising expectations for this strategy. We anticipate fundraising will continue through the balance of 2021 and into early 2022. As a reminder, the revenue generation for this strategy does not depend on when the funds close, as we earn catch up fees back to October 2020. Looking ahead, we're working on a number of interesting new products and look forward to discussing in more detail on future calls. With that, I will turn things over to Alan, to discuss the financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter, and then I'll touch on a few other items. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation, as Ann mentioned, so please feel free to have that available to follow along. As a reminder, the key drivers of our short and intermediate-term growth include one, deployment of capital that we've already raised as we generally earn management fees on the total assets of our funds for direct lending. Two, some of the products moving to full fees after their initial fee discount period. And three, raising new equity capital in direct lending and GP solutions. And remember, for GP solutions, we generally earn management fees on committed capital. So let's get into the quarterly results. Our third quarter reflected a continued strong deployment pace and fundraising across direct lending and GP solutions, resulting in robust AUM and earnings growth. On Slide 11, you can see adjusted revenues of $236 million, up 12%, FRE of $142 million up 9% and DE of $143 million up 32%, all compared to the prior quarter. Our third quarter was impacted by a significant tax benefit from a revenue share buyout with one of our large strategic investors that we announced in September. We expect the tax benefits to offset taxable earnings for the rest of the year. So you should not expect to see any material tax expense included in our DE results for the fourth quarter either. We announced a dividend of $0.09 per share for the third quarter. This represents approximately 85% of DE, which continues to be our dividend target. Since transaction close on an adjusted basis, our FRE margin was 61%, and we continue to target a range of 65% to 70%. Our compensation expense as a percentage of total revenue was 29%, in line with our expected target of 25% to 30%. On Slide 12, we reported AUM of $70.5 billion, fee paying AUM of $47 billion, and total permanent capital of $64.4 billion. AUM not yet paying fees was $9 billion as of September 30. As Doug mentioned, inclusive of the Oak Street acquisition, our AUM would be $83 billion. AUM grew 13% to $70.5 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by deployment of capital and direct lending, capital raising across the platform and portfolio appreciation in GP solutions. Fee paying AUM grew 10% to $47 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by deployment in direct lending and capital raising across the platform. AUM not yet paying fees reached $9 billion including $6.4 billion in direct lending, and $2.6 billion in GP solutions. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees, totaling approximately $140 million, primarily upon deployment for direct lending, and upon the conclusion of the fee holiday for GP solutions. If our tech BDC were to go public, we expect that could be another incremental $65 million of annualized management fees. These two factors alone could drive $205 million of annualized management fees, largely from permanent capital. As Mark highlighted earlier, we had another record quarter of deployment in direct lending, with gross originations of $8.8 billion. That makes our gross originations for the last 12-months $19.7 billion with $9.2 billion of net funded deployments. So as it relates to the $6.4 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us a little less than three quarters to fully deploy this, based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12-months. Now I'll move on to some comments around announcements we've made during or subsequent to the third quarter, starting with the Oak Street acquisition. We expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter, and therefore the financial impact of Oak Street will largely be felt in 2022 and beyond. As we highlighted in our presentation when we announced the acquisition, our base case expectation of accretion is 5% to 7% for 2022, with the potential for incremental value creation over time. This base case incorporates only Oak Street's existing business, and we are optimistic that we can potentially deliver greater accretion through the benefits of the combination that Doug highlighted earlier, including new product development and cross-selling opportunities. Next, I'll touch briefly on the revenue share buyout I mentioned earlier, which we announced in September. One of our large strategic investors had revenue share economics across some of our Dyal funds. When we bought out this revenue share arrangement it created the tax benefit I described earlier. We view transactions like this as strategically important and accretive to Blue Owl\u2019s shareholders, and we'll continue to further assess opportunities in this regard. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a very strong capital position. You can see on Slide 20 that we currently have almost $1 billion of liquidity with a long-dated capital structure that is comprised of $700 million of 10-year unsecured debt, $350 million of 30-year unsecured debt, which we issued subsequent to quarter-end, and an undrawn $150 million revolver with almost three years of maturity remaining. We continue to monitor the debt capital markets, as we see this as a source of flexible, cost efficient capital to fund our strategic initiatives. Also, subsequent to quarter-end, we instituted a dividend reinvestment program as an option for our shareholders. Details of that program can be found on our Investor Resources website. Now, pulling the lens back for a moment, before we get into Q&A, we are very pleased with the progress we've made in the short time since our merger closed in May. We have some very exciting growth plans ahead of us, and feel we are well-positioned to execute on them. We look forward to updating everyone on these in February next year. Thank you, again, to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that operator, can we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the update. Maybe we could start with the retail discussion, obviously, big number in terms of fundraising in a quarter. I think I heard you guys say $500 direct lending. And, not too long ago, I think it was running at about $100 million a month, so quite a step up. So maybe just take us through what happened in the last couple of months, to drive the increase sounds like October is off to a pretty strong start as well. Is that largely coming through the open ended fund? I think it's ORCIC. And how the fee structure sort of works on this incremental capital that's coming in? Is it now based or is it on deployed capital?\nDoug Ostrover: Okay. Good morning, and thanks for the question. This is Doug. So let me just -- I mean, I hit on all your points, but I just want to start from the beginning, from day one. When we built our business, we built it to be retail-ready. We really wanted to be a pioneer in bringing all to retail. So I think you know this, but maybe not everyone on the phone does, we've been in the retail market for over six years. I think we've created a strong brand. We've got broad distribution, we can handle meaningful volume. And, our view is today we are becoming one of the top alternative players within retail. We've got a very big distribution network. We work with some of the largest wirehouses, independent broker dealers, RIAs, family offices. I don't know the exact number of FAs that we're touching, but I think it's over 100,000 today and growing. We've got a large team that covers those advisors, lots of sales people and support functions. We expect to grow that team modestly in the U.S. We'll talk more about this in future calls, but I think you'll see us really ramp the team in Asia and Europe. And we've already made some hires. As we said in the prepared remarks, we raised over $1.1 billion of equity across retail. So that breaks out $500 million from our direct lending, $600 million through GP solutions. And as was mentioned, pro forma for Oak Street, for the third quarter, we would have been at $1.6 billion, because Oak Street raised $500 million. Let me focus for a minute on the $500 million that you referenced that we raised in direct lending, most of that came from what we call our core income fund, which is perpetually offered. We were in just one wirehouse partway through the third quarter. And we've added one additional wirehouse, subsequent to quarter-end. We're continuing to see really good traction. As you mentioned, our sales are stepping up from $500 million in the third quarter, to a nice quarter in October $350 million. We're proud of that, we think we can expand upon that. We are very optimistic, very about what we can achieve over time. Just to take a step back, we have believed since day one, since we launched six years ago, that retail is a very large opportunity. It says large, if not larger than the institutional market, but with much lower adoption rates. We think our products are very competitive. Our performance has been strong. And, I don't think many people realize this, but one of the unique things about our platform is we built our firm from day one to serve our institutional and our retail investors in the same way. Not everyone does it that way. And we think that makes a big difference in terms of what the retail experience is going to be. So we're optimistic as it relates to retail. We're not ready to make any big predictions at this point. We'll see how things go as we continue to expand distribution and the types of products that we offer into retail. One last thing which we haven't talked much about, but we are really excited for what we can do with both Dyal and the Oak Street strategies in the retail markets. We\u2019ll have a lot more to say on this in the upcoming quarters. October was strong. And, we're going to continue to execute there.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: And Alex, for our core income product ORCIC, we charge management fees on NAV.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Perfect. That was great. Thank you guys very much. Second question, maybe a little bit more technical in nature, but clearly the technicals around the stock continue to be so focused around the lockup. So maybe, it'd be helpful to just flush out what are the important dates investors should be mindful of when it comes to any shares unlocking post the deal closing in May? I think it's in the middle of November. But also a framework in terms of how many shares get unlocked, and how, if any offering does happen, kind of what would that could look like? Thanks.\nDoug Ostrover: Thanks, Alex. Really, good question. So as a reminder for everyone, we have a lock up expiration coming up next Friday, November 19. Although about 55% of our outstanding shares were coming off lockup at that time, the overwhelming majority of those shares are still sitting in private units in our structure. But I do want to provide some added transparency here since it's an important question, it's something I wanted to address. I'm going to run through a breakdown of our shares as of September 30 to map all this out. So we have about a total of a 1.4 billion outstanding shares. Of this amount, about 365 million shares are public shares, we call these the Class A common shares. These shares are either in the market currently or available for trading on November 19. And more specifically, a 170 million of the 365 million are rolling off lock up on November 19. So the rest almost 200 million shares within this 365 million are already in the market. Now the remaining outstanding shares a little over a billion shares are in private units in our structure, and we call these the common units. So let's also break this down a little more. As a reminder on a quarterly basis, our private unit holders have the ability to exchange their private units for public shares. And remember, we as the management team, we hold about 300 million shares and we're subject to a two year lockup, so we will not be part of any share sales for the foreseeable future. Separately, from these quarterly exchanges, approximately half of these private units or about 500 million shares can be exchanged at any time and become immediately available for sale. So finally, as a reminder, certain of our large shareholders have registration rights. It's possible that one or more holders may seek to do an underwritten secondary offering at some point following the expiration of the lockup. We do expect that any offering will obviously be subject to market conditions and other factors. And we expect to continue to engage with our larger shareholders to help facilitate any sales in an orderly manner.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Very helpful for that. Lot more we can cover, but I'll jump back in the queue for now. Thanks.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks. Everyone, thanks for the full update and for taking our questions. I guess, maybe I'd like to ask on Oak Street a bit. You had a pretty nice -- they had a pretty nice jump in AUM, obviously, from the end of June to the end of October. And I know there's a limit to where you can say you gave some color on their inflows. But anything you could relate in terms of what's actually their current dry powder, how we should think about once they close just kind of the built in earnings, growth that's already on the platform? That is my first question.\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. So maybe I could just start out, this is Marc, talking about kind of the Oak Street acquisition and where we are and some of their progress, and then we can jump into a couple of numbers. So first, I think what you are seeing is what we saw in wanting to combine with Oak Street, which is really an exceptionally strong franchise with a great set of products that particularly meet the moments of the risk returns are very compelling. This is a product and the reason that we acquired Oak Street, I think is something you'll find indicative of how we think about strategy. We were not interested in growing AUM to grow AUM, we've talked about this. I think you'll continuously hear us talk in a very different way on these calls. AUM is certainly part of our business. But it's not an end state for us. We want to grow the earnings power of this business. And what we really want and we found in Oak Street was an industry-leading scale franchise in an asset class with a large addressable market. So key point there, we really want to lead in the products that we're in. The second thing, strategy that lends itself well to permanent capital and long-dated capital, and we'll talk about that in a moment when Alan comments on some numbers. But you can see that in part with the retail flows that are involved in that business as well. Three, high margin business, we like high margin growth businesses, again, that's Oak Street, and a complementary investment strategy to what we already have. And then over all of that, which will always be imperative from our point of view is a very strong cultural fit. We are trying to build a business that really has a common DNA of what we're trying to accomplish as we go forward in the next 10-years and beyond. So that's really what we saw in Oak Street, and then what we're looking for as a business that we can take, that's already doing great, and help accelerate its growth through access to the Blue Owl ecosystem, which will be a great benefit to the LPs of this case, Oak Street, but any company joined our system, and a great benefit to our shareholders. So that's really what we're trying to accomplish in [indiscernible] and Oak Street. And now to come to your question on the composition of their growth, which I think reflects the compelling nature of their products, I'll just turn it to Alan for a moment.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Marc. Thank you, Robert. So the Oak Street business is $12.4 billion of AUM. We saw about a 15% growth quarter-over-quarter. Of the $12.4 billion, a little more than a third of that is permanent capital. And about half of the $12.4 billion is fee paying AUM. So they use leverage on their products and they charge on NAV, so that's the difference between fee paying and overall AUM.\nRobert Lee: Great. That's helpful. And then, maybe real quickly just also on in GP stakes and fund five. Can you just maybe update us to kind of where that is currently? I know you're still fundraising, but how we should think of that flowing in to fee paying in future closes? And what do you currently think, I know you're still raising this but obviously this probably accelerates the next fund? So if you can, any color you might have on how we should start thinking about that from a modeling perspective as we get late into \u201822 or \u201823 kind of what's the break you would take between fundraisings?\nMichael Rees: Thank you, Robert. This is Michael. We had a really good quarter in GP solutions. We deployed significant capital with our CVC transaction and continued very steady progress towards our target, overall, fundraise for fund five. We will continue that through the back half of this year and early into next year, a number of clients are looking at investing now out of their 2022 calendar. So we will spill over there. The fees get paid back all the way to the original closing in October of last year. So really, the timing of the dollars coming in is less relevant for this fund. But you hit on a really good question about what future fundraisers look like, we're not certain yet and not giving guidance towards it. But, we're about two thirds deployed on fund five. And that's the real measure for when the next fundraise will start. We always want to have dry powder and continue our position as a market leader in this space. So we'll keep you updated on future deployments, just go into Q4 and early next year, and that should give everybody some sense for when fund six will come.\nRobert Lee: Great. And if I could maybe just squeeze one more in, and I appreciate your patience, maybe for Alan. So just to make sure I have it clear on the lockups on the 19th there's 170 million of Class A that rolls off a lock up. And then there's 500 million that are currently in private units that will come off lock ups and can be exchanged quarterly and have registration rights. Is that kind of the right way to think of it, almost 700 million theoretically, on November 19?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: I think that's the right way to think about it. The 500 million shares of the billion that are in private units, those can be exchanged at any time. So yeah, so I think you should think of it that way.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of a Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, guys, good morning. On retail again, so you had one wirehouse in 3Q, now two in 4Q selling the ORCIC product and volume is clearly stepped up already meaningfully. So maybe you can update us on the pipeline of adding even more wirehouses, it seems like just adding the one has already brought up the volume there pretty meaningfully, and then maybe the timing of bringing on more wirehouses?\nDoug Ostrover: Yeah. Hi, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. I think the way to think about it is, we expect by the middle of next year to have a very robust slate of partners selling our products. And I say products, we hope to have more than one product in the market at that point. So can't really give you an exact number. But I think if you give us six to nine months, I think we'll have a syndicate put together that will rival any of our peers. And as I mentioned, we expect the core income fund those sales to continue to increase. We are working with Dyal, we're working on other products at Owl Rock and then obviously the Oak Street product, we are really excited about. I think you know, the non-traded REIT asset class is really large. We're not sure exactly what our structure will be whether it will be a non-traded REIT or another structure. But we think there is significant retail appetite for real estate products. And we think this product, the Oak Street product will compare really favorably to what's currently in the market.\nMarc Lipschultz: This is Marc, just a tack on to that last point. You'll remember the Oak Street product is really distinctive and part of again, why we were so drawn to Marc Zahr and the Oak Street business. Because it's in the same vein, it's in real estate and it owns the hard assets, but their tenants are investment grade counterparties with very long-dated leases. So, the nature of the stability of the income that gets generated by Oak Street is really frankly, it's in a different category from what the market has seen today in the retail side.\nPatrick Davitt: Great. That's helpful. Thanks. And on the new products front, I think you filed for a tech lending product similar to ORCIC recently. Could you remind us what the kind of timeline is for from filing to going live for something like that could be?\nDoug Ostrover: Well, right now we're focused on rolling out our second tech BDC. That's the focus. We're working with some of the wirehouses to see when and if we should roll out a perpetually offered tech product. But I think over the next couple of quarters, our primary focus will be on our new tech lending. We're fully invested in the first fund. We're getting a really good reception. And we'll have a lot more to say on that tech strategy in the next two quarters.\nPatrick Davitt: Great. Thanks. One quick one, if I can throw one more. The expenses I think, were a little bit higher than the most of us were expecting. Was there anything lumpy in there around the deal being closed or anything else? Or should we think about this being kind of the right run rate from here, they're going to G&A say? \nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Patrick. It's a little higher than our run rate level. Taking a step back, it's hard to look at any one quarter in isolation. We had some smaller one-time items in our expense line this quarter, a little bit deal related, a little bit fundraising related. And we've been hiring in advance of our growth, and that will normalize over the next quarter or so. Pulling the lens back, I think I noted in my prepared remarks, we are certainly within our comfortable revenue range of 25% to 30%, although we're on the higher end, and I do expect that will come down. And we're on track to hit our 65% to 70% EBITDA margin target next year.\nPatrick Davitt: Thanks a lot.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Patrick.\nOperator: All right. And we have a follow-up question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up. I wanted to go back to Marc\u2019s comments around origination, and the numbers definitely stood out this quarter, you guys did almost $9 billion of gross origination versus $5 billion, I guess, last quarter. We tend to think of just the origination volume is perhaps more of a binding constraint for growth for you guys, just given the fact everybody's chasing yield.  So, impressive growth, so maybe take a step back and walk us through, the sources of acceleration sequentially, and it sounds like Q4, you're running at about a similar pace. So, is it tech? Is it the traditional BDC direct lending products? Just a little more color there, and the opportunity set would be great.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Yeah, more than happy to, and thank you again, for the time today. So we continue to see very robust growth in demand for the direct lending products. And, candidly, I think we see that very much continuing, as you said, to be specific. And Craig commented on this on the earnings call for ORCC the other day. We are seeing great strength carry forward into the fourth quarter. The third quarters volumes are obviously tremendous. But if you look at the fourth quarter, we have every reason to think it's going to be another robust quarter, maybe reference back more to Q2, than Q3, which was pretty anomalous. But the demand side of this equation is really exceptional. And I think it reflects a few things, certainly it reflects the continued adoption by the private equity community of the private solution. And, of course, the continued secular growth of the private equity funds themselves. There's what at least $1.4 trillion of dry powder in the hands of private equity firms, $400 billion raised just in the second-half. We all know what the fund flows look like, which, of course, we're the beneficiaries of on the GP stake side of our business as well. But in any case, that growth builds in the structural demand for financings. And so what we're seeing is a growth in the overall demand for financing and then growth in share for direct lending solutions. And why is that, I think there's a few things going on. One is just the ability by a handful of us to meet the largest financing needs. And part of the strategy for Blue Owl and Owl Rock from the beginning, was to be one of the few people that could be the one stop shop for any financing that required.  And that's continued to be true and we've continued to grow along with a couple of our peers. And so now we can finance, as noted, billion dollar plus capital structures. So part of the reason back five years ago there hadn't been a billion dollar financing, it was partly because of the demand side in terms of what people would use direct lending solutions for, but partly because where was the available capital. Now, both have met each other. So $17 billion plus finance is that just we've participated in this year. And I do think that's reflective of a continuing trend that we feel is pretty durable. And the reason that's durable just to reference back to the earlier comments, the three P's of direct lending, which is really predictability, and privacy and partnership. And that last one partnership is really front of mind for users of capital, the power of knowing who holds that very large part of your capital structure when you've invested a huge amount of equity. Remember, that our share of these capital structures has been coming down, and unusual feature in a later stage, so to speak of some kind of economic cycle. And so, we're now down in the mid-40s, in our typical loan and below 30 in tech. So protecting that equity is a very small price to pay to pay incremental. Yes, it costs more, yes, the documents are tighter. But you also know who to pick up the phone and call when you want to make a change, for better or worse, preferably for better. So, we really feel like a very durable, dynamic, and feel very good about the book we've built and don't really see a practical limit to sort of the addressable market out there.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Very helpful. Thanks. Last one, I promise. This one's for Alan, the revenue share stuff. There are more -- I think I heard you say there are potentially more revenue shares that could be renegotiated, the play you guys did it this quarter. Besides the tax benefit, are there any other kind of P&L or impact on pre-tax DE, we should be thinking about when things like that happen?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Great question, Alex. Thank you. We have a few small revenue shares remaining in one of the Dyal funds. And we have -- part of what we've done over the past six years is we have some seed investors in different parts of our capital structure. They come through the minority interest line. So that's already fully consolidated into our results. And I commented in my prepared remarks that, we'll continue to assess other opportunities. We just completed a buyout of our tech seed investors, which closed yesterday. So you'll see a comment in that in our queue. That just wipes out the minority interest portion that's already fully embedded in our revenues and our expenses.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Thanks again for all the time.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Of course. Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Alright. We also have a follow-up question from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. And there was a lot of questions and conversation about products and new product development. And there's a lot going on. But I'm just kind of curious, I mean, where things stand. I know you had talked in the past about your co invest, strategic capital, and I think also kind of a GP secondaries once all the firms were kind of married together. So any update on how you're thinking about that, as we start to look into 2022 and beyond, those are getting close to launch some of those products?\nMichael Rees: Thanks, Robert. This is Michael. The area of co investment in secondary are two that we feel very strongly about as the overall industry continues to evolve. I think we're seeing real structural change in the industry. And those parts of the market are right for long-term structural growth. We have alluded to in the past product development in this area. And we are getting very close to having announcements that we can [indiscernible] on the calls. But, our ecosystem across the Blue Owl platform, as Marc said, of being a capital provider from a GP solution on the far spectrum to portfolio company loan on the other end, and everything in between -- that business model is what we're executing on. And as we continue to fill in some of those product gaps, we think the ecosystem will really play to our benefit.\nRobert Lee: Great. That was it. Thanks for taking my question.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Robert.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] All right. There are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the call back to Doug Ostrover for any closing remarks.\nDoug Ostrover: Well, thank you. And I just wanted to take a minute, thank everybody again for joining. I know I speak on behalf of everyone at Blue Owl, when I say we're grateful for the partnership, the support. We look forward to speaking with all of you next quarter. And thanks, again.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes the Blue Owl third quarter 2021 conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter, and then I'll touch on a few other items. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation, as Ann mentioned, so please feel free to have that available to follow along. As a reminder, the key drivers of our short and intermediate-term growth include one, deployment of capital that we've already raised as we generally earn management fees on the total assets of our funds for direct lending. Two, some of the products moving to full fees after their initial fee discount period. And three, raising new equity capital in direct lending and GP solutions. And remember, for GP solutions, we generally earn management fees on committed capital. So let's get into the quarterly results. Our third quarter reflected a continued strong deployment pace and fundraising across direct lending and GP solutions, resulting in robust AUM and earnings growth. On Slide 11, you can see adjusted revenues of $236 million, up 12%, FRE of $142 million up 9% and DE of $143 million up 32%, all compared to the prior quarter. Our third quarter was impacted by a significant tax benefit from a revenue share buyout with one of our large strategic investors that we announced in September. We expect the tax benefits to offset taxable earnings for the rest of the year. So you should not expect to see any material tax expense included in our DE results for the fourth quarter either. We announced a dividend of $0.09 per share for the third quarter. This represents approximately 85% of DE, which continues to be our dividend target. Since transaction close on an adjusted basis, our FRE margin was 61%, and we continue to target a range of 65% to 70%. Our compensation expense as a percentage of total revenue was 29%, in line with our expected target of 25% to 30%. On Slide 12, we reported AUM of $70.5 billion, fee paying AUM of $47 billion, and total permanent capital of $64.4 billion. AUM not yet paying fees was $9 billion as of September 30. As Doug mentioned, inclusive of the Oak Street acquisition, our AUM would be $83 billion. AUM grew 13% to $70.5 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by deployment of capital and direct lending, capital raising across the platform and portfolio appreciation in GP solutions. Fee paying AUM grew 10% to $47 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by deployment in direct lending and capital raising across the platform. AUM not yet paying fees reached $9 billion including $6.4 billion in direct lending, and $2.6 billion in GP solutions. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees, totaling approximately $140 million, primarily upon deployment for direct lending, and upon the conclusion of the fee holiday for GP solutions. If our tech BDC were to go public, we expect that could be another incremental $65 million of annualized management fees. These two factors alone could drive $205 million of annualized management fees, largely from permanent capital. As Mark highlighted earlier, we had another record quarter of deployment in direct lending, with gross originations of $8.8 billion. That makes our gross originations for the last 12-months $19.7 billion with $9.2 billion of net funded deployments. So as it relates to the $6.4 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us a little less than three quarters to fully deploy this, based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12-months. Now I'll move on to some comments around announcements we've made during or subsequent to the third quarter, starting with the Oak Street acquisition. We expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter, and therefore the financial impact of Oak Street will largely be felt in 2022 and beyond. As we highlighted in our presentation when we announced the acquisition, our base case expectation of accretion is 5% to 7% for 2022, with the potential for incremental value creation over time. This base case incorporates only Oak Street's existing business, and we are optimistic that we can potentially deliver greater accretion through the benefits of the combination that Doug highlighted earlier, including new product development and cross-selling opportunities. Next, I'll touch briefly on the revenue share buyout I mentioned earlier, which we announced in September. One of our large strategic investors had revenue share economics across some of our Dyal funds. When we bought out this revenue share arrangement it created the tax benefit I described earlier. We view transactions like this as strategically important and accretive to Blue Owl's shareholders, and we'll continue to further assess opportunities in this regard. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a very strong capital position. You can see on Slide 20 that we currently have almost $1 billion of liquidity with a long-dated capital structure that is comprised of $700 million of 10-year unsecured debt, $350 million of 30-year unsecured debt, which we issued subsequent to quarter-end, and an undrawn $150 million revolver with almost three years of maturity remaining. We continue to monitor the debt capital markets, as we see this as a source of flexible, cost efficient capital to fund our strategic initiatives. Also, subsequent to quarter-end, we instituted a dividend reinvestment program as an option for our shareholders. Details of that program can be found on our Investor Resources website. Now, pulling the lens back for a moment, before we get into Q&A, we are very pleased with the progress we've made in the short time since our merger closed in May. We have some very exciting growth plans ahead of us, and feel we are well-positioned to execute on them. We look forward to updating everyone on these in February next year. Thank you, again, to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that operator, can we please open the line for questions? And Alex, for our core income product ORCIC, we charge management fees on NAV. Thank you, Marc. Thank you, Robert. So the Oak Street business is $12.4 billion of AUM. We saw about a 15% growth quarter-over-quarter. Of the $12.4 billion, a little more than a third of that is permanent capital. And about half of the $12.4 billion is fee paying AUM. So they use leverage on their products and they charge on NAV, so that's the difference between fee paying and overall AUM. I think that's the right way to think about it. The 500 million shares of the billion that are in private units, those can be exchanged at any time. So yeah, so I think you should think of it that way. Thank you. Thanks, Patrick. It's a little higher than our run rate level. Taking a step back, it's hard to look at any one quarter in isolation. We had some smaller one-time items in our expense line this quarter, a little bit deal related, a little bit fundraising related. And we've been hiring in advance of our growth, and that will normalize over the next quarter or so. Pulling the lens back, I think I noted in my prepared remarks, we are certainly within our comfortable revenue range of 25% to 30%, although we're on the higher end, and I do expect that will come down. And we're on track to hit our 65% to 70% EBITDA margin target next year. Thank you, Patrick. Yeah, more than happy to, and thank you again, for the time today. So we continue to see very robust growth in demand for the direct lending products. And, candidly, I think we see that very much continuing, as you said, to be specific. And Craig commented on this on the earnings call for ORCC the other day. We are seeing great strength carry forward into the fourth quarter. The third quarters volumes are obviously tremendous. But if you look at the fourth quarter, we have every reason to think it's going to be another robust quarter, maybe reference back more to Q2, than Q3, which was pretty anomalous.

            "name": "Michael Rees",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. We continue to see investor interest in our GP solution strategy, which provides a balance of current income and appreciation potential tied to the continued growth of the industry. And from an investment standpoint, the pipeline remains very strong as firms in the space continue to scale and require substantial growth capital to do so. In the third quarter, we continue to form strong partnerships with top private managers including CVC. We are extremely pleased to be establishing this relationship with CVC, the culmination of six years of productive dialogue and relationship building. They are a true leader in the industry. As of today, we have invested, committed or have agreement in principle to commit approximately 65% of what we expect to raise for our GP minority equity strategy in our fifth fund. Our value proposition of providing passive equity capital to premier managers through minority stakes has continued to resonate in the market. And even in the early days of Blue Owl, the merger between Owl Rock and Dyal, we've created significant touch points that can drive incremental opportunities down the road. Our GP solutions business ended the quarter at $35.9 billion of AUM, reflecting new capital raised and appreciation across the portfolio. Performance remains very strong, with fund three marked at a gross IRR of 33% and net IRR of 25% since inception. And fund four marked at a gross IRR of 140% and net IRR of 86% since inception. What people may not realize about these IRRs is that in addition to the capital appreciation over time, investors are getting cash on cash returns on a regular basis, meaning our LPs are receiving significant amounts of income while their underlying investments appreciate. For example, as of September 30, fund three was closed only in 2016, has already returned approximately 75% of the capital contributed by the LPs in the fund, and we continue to hold the majority of our positions in each of those 10 underlying firms. We think our funds standout in this respect marrying potential for private equity returns with ongoing income generation. We raised $1.6 billion of new capital during the quarter, primarily in our GP minority equity strategy. And we remain confident in our prior capital raising expectations for this strategy. We anticipate fundraising will continue through the balance of 2021 and into early 2022. As a reminder, the revenue generation for this strategy does not depend on when the funds close, as we earn catch up fees back to October 2020. Looking ahead, we're working on a number of interesting new products and look forward to discussing in more detail on future calls. With that, I will turn things over to Alan, to discuss the financial results. Thank you, Robert. This is Michael. We had a really good quarter in GP solutions. We deployed significant capital with our CVC transaction and continued very steady progress towards our target, overall, fundraise for fund five. We will continue that through the back half of this year and early into next year, a number of clients are looking at investing now out of their 2022 calendar. So we will spill over there. The fees get paid back all the way to the original closing in October of last year. So really, the timing of the dollars coming in is less relevant for this fund. But you hit on a really good question about what future fundraisers look like, we're not certain yet and not giving guidance towards it. But, we're about two thirds deployed on fund five. And that's the real measure for when the next fundraise will start. We always want to have dry powder and continue our position as a market leader in this space. So we'll keep you updated on future deployments, just go into Q4 and early next year, and that should give everybody some sense for when fund six will come. Thanks, Robert. This is Michael. The area of co investment in secondary are two that we feel very strongly about as the overall industry continues to evolve. I think we're seeing real structural change in the industry.

            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Doug. Across the industry, we are seeing accelerating use of direct lending as a solution for private equity sponsors and corporations, as they continue to see the benefits of working with one lender. Through that one relationship, borrowers find greater predictability, privacy and partnership, the three P's that make private credit a very attractive alternative to broadly syndicated markets. So zooming in a bit, we really like our market positioning of lending to upper middle market companies at scale, and believe the Blue Owl will continue to take market share over time. Turning to the third quarter specifically, as you can see on Slide 15 of our presentation, our direct lending business saw record originations of $8.8 billion, surpassing the prior record of $5.1 billion from the second quarter of 2021. Market conditions remained very supportive of M&A activity during the quarter, and this favorable environment has sustained through the first part of the fourth quarter. Although it has been just six months since the merger between Dyal and Owl Rock, we've seen concrete and positive impacts to our deal flow as a result. Direct lending ended the quarter with $34.6 billion of AUM, reflecting 11% growth from the prior quarter as a result of strong origination activity. If you go back about five years, I don't think there had been a single direct lending solution of $1 billion or greater. Year-to-date, we have signed or closed on 17 deals with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion. This clearly demonstrates how the addressable market for direct lending continues to expand, as private equity sponsors and private companies value our ability to provide bespoke and flexible solutions and certainty of execution. Performance remains very strong, with a gross IRR of 12% and a net IRR of 9% since inception, at the end of the third quarter for ORCC, our publicly traded diversified lending BDC, and a gross IRR of 23% and net IRR of 18% since inception, at the end of the third quarter for ORTF, our tech lending BDC. We've continued to focus on downside protection, with a weighted average loan to value in the mid-40s in our diversified lending strategy, and a weighted average loan to value of less than 30% in our tech lending strategy as of September 30. And our credit performance remains strong, with annualized net realized losses of approximately 5 basis points since inception. As Doug mentioned, retail fundraising within direct lending was roughly $500 million for the third quarter. We gained even more traction in October, with nearly $350 million raised in this month alone. And we continue to broaden our distribution and evaluate new products for retail. Between retail expansion, new product development, and the strength of our existing platforms, we're very optimistic about the growth ahead for our direct lending business, and look forward to providing updates on new exciting products in the coming quarters. With that, let me turn it to my partner, Michael Rees, to discuss GP Solutions in more detail. Sure. So maybe I could just start out, this is Marc, talking about kind of the Oak Street acquisition and where we are and some of their progress, and then we can jump into a couple of numbers. So first, I think what you are seeing is what we saw in wanting to combine with Oak Street, which is really an exceptionally strong franchise with a great set of products that particularly meet the moments of the risk returns are very compelling. This is a product and the reason that we acquired Oak Street, I think is something you'll find indicative of how we think about strategy. We were not interested in growing AUM to grow AUM, we've talked about this. I think you'll continuously hear us talk in a very different way on these calls. AUM is certainly part of our business. But it's not an end state for us. We want to grow the earnings power of this business. And what we really want and we found in Oak Street was an industry-leading scale franchise in an asset class with a large addressable market. So key point there, we really want to lead in the products that we're in. The second thing, strategy that lends itself well to permanent capital and long-dated capital, and we'll talk about that in a moment when Alan comments on some numbers. But you can see that in part with the retail flows that are involved in that business as well. Three, high margin business, we like high margin growth businesses, again, that's Oak Street, and a complementary investment strategy to what we already have. And then over all of that, which will always be imperative from our point of view is a very strong cultural fit. We are trying to build a business that really has a common DNA of what we're trying to accomplish as we go forward in the next 10-years and beyond. So that's really what we saw in Oak Street, and then what we're looking for as a business that we can take, that's already doing great, and help accelerate its growth through access to the Blue Owl ecosystem, which will be a great benefit to the LPs of this case, Oak Street, but any company joined our system, and a great benefit to our shareholders. So that's really what we're trying to accomplish in [indiscernible] and Oak Street. And now to come to your question on the composition of their growth, which I think reflects the compelling nature of their products, I'll just turn it to Alan for a moment. This is Marc, just a tack on to that last point. You'll remember the Oak Street product is really distinctive and part of again, why we were so drawn to Marc Zahr and the Oak Street business. Because it's in the same vein, it's in real estate and it owns the hard assets, but their tenants are investment grade counterparties with very long-dated leases. So, the nature of the stability of the income that gets generated by Oak Street is really frankly, it's in a different category from what the market has seen today in the retail side."

            "name": "Doug Ostrover",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. It's been a busy few months for Blue Owl, so we're excited to provide all of you with an update on what we've been doing to move our strategic initiatives forward. Before I talk about this quarter, though, I'd like to take a moment to call out the tailwinds that have been present across alternatives, and which have obviously benefited not just us, but our peers as well. M&A activity has been near record levels, driving elevated lending activity across public and private markets. Accommodating equity markets have allowed for sponsors to exit investments and return capital to investors who in turn, putting money back into alternatives. GPs are raising larger funds more quickly and are broadening their investment capabilities to be more relevant to their investors, which drives capital needs across their businesses. The beauty of Blue Owl is that our growth does not take away from the growth of other alternative asset managers, but in fact supports it. We grow with our peers as we lend to their portfolio companies and provide growth equity to the GPs. And we plan to continue expanding our market share, indirect lending and investing in additional premier franchises in GP solutions. Turning to the third quarter, Blue Owl's strong results reflect continued robust growth for the firm, as gross originations reached a record $8.8 billion across direct lending. And we raised capital across fundraising channels and investment strategies. AUM grew 13% to over $70 billion quarter-over-quarter, reflecting ongoing fundraising across the platform and appreciation in GP solutions. A few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Oak Street, adding another market-leading scaled, yield oriented capability to the Blue Owl platform. Pro forma for Oak Street, our September 30 assets under management would be $83 billion. And I'll touch on the compelling opportunities we see with Oak Street in a minute. Our distributable earnings grew 32% from the prior quarter, as a result of the new capital commitments, significant capital deployment firm wide and a tax benefit that Alan will discuss in greater detail. Our distributable earnings are anchored by the high level of permanent capital across the business, with 97% of our management fees coming from permanent capital. This means shareholders have significant visibility into our existing earnings power, and then we continue to layer on incremental earnings through fundraising and deployment. We think this aspect of the Blue Owl story is powerful. None of our peers look like us with respect to our permanent capital profile, and it allows us to grow faster than our peers. Our focus remains on growing earnings, not AUM. And we will always prioritize profitability and scalability over asset gathering. Last quarter for our inaugural earnings call, we presented the history of the Owl Rock and Dyal businesses, the type of differentiated investment capabilities that each platform offers investors, and how they grew into the businesses they are today.  We talked about the unifying aspects of the firm as they came together under the Blue Owl banner, including one, their positioning as market leaders in their respective spaces. Two, the commitment to creating differentiated yield solutions for investors. Three, the focus on long-dated and permanent capital streams. Four, the notable synergies that we anticipate, as we leverage the power of the combined Owl Rock and Dyal ecosystems. And five, the culture of respect and collaboration that permeates through our interactions with each other, our investors and our counterparts in the market.  And we expect to demonstrate that combining these businesses under one roof will result in greater value creation than each would have on a standalone basis. Said another way, the benefits of the Blue Owl ecosystem should be measurably positive. The steps we are taking today, in building out our investment capabilities, investing in our corporate infrastructure and creating a cross collaboration framework across business lines are creating the runway for continued and meaningful growth ahead. Let me highlight a few things that I think will be important areas of focus for the firm over the coming quarters and years, and then I'll turn it over to Mark and Michael to discuss direct lending and GP Solutions in greater detail. First, I want to spend a minute on our technology lending BDC, which has reached nearly $7 billion of assets under management, and has generated a gross IRR of 23%, and a net IRR of 18% since inception, a strong result for a BDC that focuses on senior secured lending. When we went to market with the strategy in 2018, we have the first tech focused BDC of its size in the space. And it was tough to raise that equity. Tech lending sounded risky to people, and they couldn't imagine our vision, which was a fund focused on making top of the capital structure, senior secured loans to well-established upper middle market technology companies, with mission-critical products and recurring revenue basis. We have been able to construct the portfolio with significant downside protection. And our track record in this product has been terrific, with no losses since inception, and no loans on non-accrual. We think the industry is in the very early innings of the adoption of private credit solutions to technology firms. And we are a leader due to our scale, domain expertise and broad relationships, which we have been developing for many years.  For many of the tech companies to which we lend, we're providing growth capital at an attractive cost relative to raising another equity round. And we can provide bespoke solutions to fit their specific needs. The growth of this tech lending strategy could be very meaningful for Blue Owl over time, and we look forward to providing more updates and future quarters. The next area I'd like to highlight is retail, which has been a primary focus for the Owl Rock team since we founded the business. While retail flows to alternative assets have really begun to accelerate in recent years, we believe retail allocations to alternatives have a lot of room to expand and expect Blue Owl to be amongst the meaningful beneficiaries of this trend. We're still in the very early days of rolling out direct lending, GP Solutions and down the line net lease products to retail, particularly in the wirehouse channels. The early feedback on our products has been very positive, with retail investors appreciating the yield profile we provide for a senior secured product, as well as the fact that they are invested in the same loans as our institutional investors. Our BDCs are compelling alternatives to traditional fixed income products. And as you know, retail allocations to fixed income are very large. For the third quarter, we raised over $1.1 billion of equity capital across retail, with approximately $500 million of that coming from direct lending, and $600 million coming from GP Solutions. And pro forma for Oak Street, our retail fundraising for the third quarter would have been over $1.6 billion, as Oak Street raised more than $500 million from retail during the quarter. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves on the potential opportunity in retail. But clearly, large amounts of capital can be raised in this channel. And we intend to be fully in the mix with a number of differentiated products. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, I'd like to spend a moment on our acquisition of Oak Street, a leading real estate private equity firm, focused on the triple net lease market with over $12 billion of AUM as of September 30. As we detail on Slide 8 of the presentation, we're very excited to have the Oak Street team join Blue Owl. They've built a great business with a market-leading position in net lease, and we expect it to be complementary to Blue Owl's platform in many ways. This transaction fits the parameters we've been looking for, namely one, an ability for Blue Owl to take a strong industry-leading franchise and leverage our scale and infrastructure to accelerate its already robust runway for growth. Two, a product set that can translate well to both institutional and retail investors, and lends itself to long-dated and permanent capital structures, which net lease certainly does. Three, affirm with an investment focus that does not compete with our existing Blue Owl investment capabilities, but rather is complementary and which has a big addressable market. And finally, we wanted to have the ability to create synergies for our stakeholders in the following ways. This transaction offers our LPs, who may not have known Oak Street or invested in net lease previously, exposure to a world-class investment platform, now supported by the scale of Blue Owl's infrastructure. And the same is the case for Oak Street LPs, the potential for cross-selling is meaningful, given the limited 3% overlap in our respective LP basis. We also believe Oak Street's net lease expertise can be very beneficial to the sponsors that we work with, in direct lending and our partner managers in GP Solutions. From a retail perspective, we welcome the opportunity to leverage Blue Owl's broad distribution platform to further expand Oak Street's retail presence across existing and new strategies. And finally, for our public shareholders, we expect that the Oak Street transaction will be 5% to 7% accretive to distributable earnings per share, starting in 2022, based on Oak Street's existing growth trajectory. But as we consider all the things that we can do as a combined platform, the benefit to Blue Owl's shareholders could exceed that over time. I also like to add that our team has known Marc Zahr, the CEO and Founder of Oak Street for a number of years now. And we have a lot of admiration for the business he's built, and importantly, the culture he's created at Oak Street, which we think is very similar to what we have at Blue Owl. We're excited to share more about the business once the transaction is closed, and to introduce Marc to our Blue Owl stakeholders. Marc will be joining Blue Owl's Board of Directors and Executive committee, and will play an integral role in the strategic initiatives we have planned. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Lipschultz, to give you an update on our direct lending business. Mark? Okay. Good morning, and thanks for the question. This is Doug. So let me just -- I mean, I hit on all your points, but I just want to start from the beginning, from day one. When we built our business, we built it to be retail-ready. We really wanted to be a pioneer in bringing all to retail. So I think you know this, but maybe not everyone on the phone does, we've been in the retail market for over six years. I think we've created a strong brand. We've got broad distribution, we can handle meaningful volume. And, our view is today we are becoming one of the top alternative players within retail. We've got a very big distribution network. We work with some of the largest wirehouses, independent broker dealers, RIAs, family offices. I don't know the exact number of FAs that we're touching, but I think it's over 100,000 today and growing. We've got a large team that covers those advisors, lots of sales people and support functions. We expect to grow that team modestly in the U.S. We'll talk more about this in future calls, but I think you'll see us really ramp the team in Asia and Europe. And we've already made some hires. As we said in the prepared remarks, we raised over $1.1 billion of equity across retail. So that breaks out $500 million from our direct lending, $600 million through GP solutions. And as was mentioned, pro forma for Oak Street, for the third quarter, we would have been at $1.6 billion, because Oak Street raised $500 million. Let me focus for a minute on the $500 million that you referenced that we raised in direct lending, most of that came from what we call our core income fund, which is perpetually offered. We were in just one wirehouse partway through the third quarter. And we've added one additional wirehouse, subsequent to quarter-end. We're continuing to see really good traction. As you mentioned, our sales are stepping up from $500 million in the third quarter, to a nice quarter in October $350 million. We're proud of that, we think we can expand upon that. We are very optimistic, very about what we can achieve over time. Just to take a step back, we have believed since day one, since we launched six years ago, that retail is a very large opportunity. It says large, if not larger than the institutional market, but with much lower adoption rates. We think our products are very competitive. Our performance has been strong. And, I don't think many people realize this, but one of the unique things about our platform is we built our firm from day one to serve our institutional and our retail investors in the same way. Not everyone does it that way. And we think that makes a big difference in terms of what the retail experience is going to be. So we're optimistic as it relates to retail. We're not ready to make any big predictions at this point. We'll see how things go as we continue to expand distribution and the types of products that we offer into retail. One last thing which we haven't talked much about, but we are really excited for what we can do with both Dyal and the Oak Street strategies in the retail markets. We'll have a lot more to say on this in the upcoming quarters. October was strong. And, we're going to continue to execute there. Thanks, Alex. Really, good question. So as a reminder for everyone, we have a lock up expiration coming up next Friday, November 19. Although about 55% of our outstanding shares were coming off lockup at that time, the overwhelming majority of those shares are still sitting in private units in our structure. But I do want to provide some added transparency here since it's an important question, it's something I wanted to address. I'm going to run through a breakdown of our shares as of September 30 to map all this out. So we have about a total of a 1.4 billion outstanding shares. Of this amount, about 365 million shares are public shares, we call these the Class A common shares. These shares are either in the market currently or available for trading on November 19. And more specifically, a 170 million of the 365 million are rolling off lock up on November 19. So the rest almost 200 million shares within this 365 million are already in the market. Now the remaining outstanding shares a little over a billion shares are in private units in our structure, and we call these the common units. So let's also break this down a little more. As a reminder on a quarterly basis, our private unit holders have the ability to exchange their private units for public shares. And remember, we as the management team, we hold about 300 million shares and we're subject to a two year lockup, so we will not be part of any share sales for the foreseeable future. Separately, from these quarterly exchanges, approximately half of these private units or about 500 million shares can be exchanged at any time and become immediately available for sale. So finally, as a reminder, certain of our large shareholders have registration rights. It's possible that one or more holders may seek to do an underwritten secondary offering at some point following the expiration of the lockup. We do expect that any offering will obviously be subject to market conditions and other factors. And we expect to continue to engage with our larger shareholders to help facilitate any sales in an orderly manner. Thank you, Alex. Yeah. Hi, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. I think the way to think about it is, we expect by the middle of next year to have a very robust slate of partners selling our products. And I say products, we hope to have more than one product in the market at that point. So can't really give you an exact number. But I think if you give us six to nine months, I think we'll have a syndicate put together that will rival any of our peers. And as I mentioned, we expect the core income fund those sales to continue to increase. We are working with Dyal, we're working on other products at Owl Rock and then obviously the Oak Street product, we are really excited about. I think you know, the non-traded REIT asset class is really large. We're not sure exactly what our structure will be whether it will be a non-traded REIT or another structure. But we think there is significant retail appetite for real estate products. And we think this product, the Oak Street product will compare really favorably to what's currently in the market. Well, right now we're focused on rolling out our second tech BDC. That's the focus. We're working with some of the wirehouses to see when and if we should roll out a perpetually offered tech product. But I think over the next couple of quarters, our primary focus will be on our new tech lending. We're fully invested in the first fund. We're getting a really good reception. And we'll have a lot more to say on that tech strategy in the next two quarters. Thank you, Robert. Well, thank you. And I just wanted to take a minute, thank everybody again for joining. I know I speak on behalf of everyone at Blue Owl, when I say we're grateful for the partnership, the support. We look forward to speaking with all of you next quarter. And thanks, again."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to advise all parties that this conference is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to Ann Dai, Head of Investor Relations for Blue Owl. \nAnn Dai: Thanks, operator, and good morning, to everyone on the call today. Joining me this morning are Doug Ostrover, our Chief Executive Officer; Marc Lipschultz and Michael Rees, our Co-President and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer.  I'd like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company's control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors including those described from time to time in Blue Owl Capital's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements.  We would also like to remind everyone that we will refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our press release available on the Investor Resource section of our website at blueowl.com.  This morning, we issued our financial results for the second quarter of 2021 and reported adjusted fee-related earnings or FRE of $0.10 per share and adjusted distributable earnings or DE of $0.09 per share. We also declared a dividend of $0.04 per share payable on September 8th for shareholders of record as of August 24th. We'll be referring to the earnings presentation throughout the call today, so please have that on hand. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug. \nDoug Ostrover : Thank you, Lian. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for our first Blue Owl earnings call. We are very appreciative of the time that you are taking to join us on our call today and we look forward to seeing you all in person, hopefully sometime soon.  Given that this is our first earnings call, I thought I would start with a brief introduction to the Blue Owl story and highlight our vision for the combined platform and the tremendous growth we see ahead. Marc and Michael will then provide their perspectives on what we're seeing across the industry before providing color on business performance for Direct Lending and GP solutions. From there, Alan will cover our financial results and then we will be happy to take any questions.  So, let me start with a very high-level view of Blue Owl\u2019s position in the marketplace. We are a leading solutions provider for the private markets with $62 billion of assets under management, of which $8.5 billion does not yet earned fees, but will once that capital is deployed. And notably, 97% of our management fees come from permanent capital. So, we have very high visibility into our earnings growth over the next six, twelve and even eighteen months.  We support the entire ecosystem of alternative asset managers through two businesses. Direct Lending, where we provide capital to sponsors to finance their portfolio companies and GP solutions. Where we provide capital to the alternative asset managers themselves, essentially, we are selling the picks and shovels to the industry. Or said another way, we are the equivalent of SaaS providers to the alternative asset management space.  Our long-term goal is to continue to expand meaningfully in these businesses and add additional capabilities that also fit this mandate of serving the private market\u2019s ecosystem.  As I think about the market landscape for Blue Owl today, I see two businesses, which are trying to benefit greatly from the continued growth in the alternative asset management industry. We remain in a historically low rate environment with investors searching for incremental yield and increasingly expanding their allocations to alternative assets.  As the alternatives world expands further, we expect Blue Owl to continue to take market share, as we provide capital solutions to these more mature larger segments of the industry. What we've also seen is that during challenging markets, such as the financial crisis of 2008, the managers with experienced investment teams and strong track records attract the most capital as investors worked to protect their portfolios. We firmly believe Blue Owl will fall into that category, as well.  In addition to the strong growth we see ahead for each of Direct Lending and GP Solutions on a standalone basis, us, we see significant opportunities for synergies between the two businesses.  Today, we have just 2% overlap in our LP base, which tells us two things; one, that our combined reach across the investor universe has grown dramatically through this transaction; and two, that there are many opportunities for us to introduce our LPs to unique yield and return opportunities that they may not have had on their radars.  We also see the potential for synergies on the investment side, as there will be times when Direct Lending can bring unique investment opportunities to GP Solutions and vice versa translating into additional value for limited partners and shareholders.  Given that some of the audience maybe newer to the Blue Owl story, let me back up and provide a brief history of our businesses. I am going to start with Owl Rock. We started Owl Rock with the goal of building one of the premier firms in Direct Lending. We saw a meaningful opportunity in the upper middle market lending space and knew that we could raise a significant amount of capital to address that opportunity.  We were confident that we could leverage our combined market experience and relationships to build a wide funnel of deals, select those with the best risk reward opportunities, create downside protection through disciplined risk management and ultimately generate strong returns for our investors. And we thought by doing all of that, we could create an institutional quality best-in-class lending platform.  Over the past 5.5 years, I think we've certainly achieved that goal. Our ability to deliver timely and flexible solutions in scale has resonated with the market, as we have originated $35 billion of loans since we started our business.  We've established ourselves as a leading competitor in the upper middle market lending space with over $31 billion of AUM and our strict underwriting, strong covenant and focus on portfolio diversification have resulted in industry-leading returns for our investors. COVID was an unexpected test for our platform, much as it was for the broader U.S. and global economies and we as a firm made it through this very difficult period exceptionally well.  The $35 billion we have originated has been across 300 investments. And we have had only two realized losses of original principals through June 30th with notion along those investments of just $255 million or less than 1% of what we've originated and we still own both of those investments. This speaks to the quality and resiliency of the portfolio.  We have built one of the largest dedicated Direct Lending investment teams in the industry with nearly 70 investment professionals, including 23 managing directors with average experience of twenty years. And despite the impressive growth that we've experienced in our Direct Lending business since we launched 5.5 short years ago, I truly believe the balance is still ahead.  Now turning to GP Capital Solutions. Dyal is the clear leader in its market having founded the industry and taken stakes in over 50 alternative asset management firms since inception and that number continues to grow. In addition to providing growth capital for new and existing businesses, Dyal offers great strategic value to its partner managers through its business services platform team and also offers debt financing solutions.  The partner managers in Dyal\u2019s Funds selectively manage roughly $1 trillion of AUM, giving Dyal a unique and very broad perspective on trends in the alternative asset management industry. We will endeavor to share the insights we partner from this special perch with you.  I think Michael and the team have built a terrific business and it really fits well with what we focus on at Owl Rock. We want to be market leaders in the space. We look for unique value propositions that allow us to generate strong performance for our investors and we like businesses where we can create scale. The Dyal business falls into all of those categories.  Shifting out to Blue Owl\u2019s financial profile and Alan is going to cover this in greater detail later in the call. We've had the benefit of watching with other companies in our space have done and we've seen what works and what doesn't. We believe the market has told us that it values a steady and predictable earnings stream with high growth potential and that's exactly what we offer at Blue Owl.  FRE currently constitutes a 100% of our earnings, meaning our revenues come from management fees, which are highly predictable each year. When it comes to AUM, we are not on the hamster wheel raising capital, because when we raise increment AUM we keep it since almost all of our AUM is permanent.  We are not required to return capital to investors. We like to think of it as a layer cake. As we raise capital, we just add a new layer of capital to our existing permanent capital base. Unlike most alternative asset managers, we don't have to raise $20 billion to grow our AUM by $10 billion since capital doesn't leave the system, and that's a big differentiator for our platform.  Because of this, we have industry-leading growth generated from highly visible drivers and best-in-class profitability in FRE margins. We have a track record of investment outperformance and diversified and growing distribution capabilities across the institutional investor and retail distribution channels. We offer a healthy 2.5% dividend yield based on our June 30 closing stock price and we are hopeful that our quarterly dividend could double by the fourth quarter of next year.  Our balance sheet is strong with almost $600 million of liquidity and we are committed to maintaining our investment grade ratings over time. And importantly, we have an industry-leading, fully aligned management team. We did not sell any shares in the transaction and we own about 25% of Blue Owl outstanding shares. So we are well aligned with our shareholders.  In addition, we, as a management team, have personally invested a substantial amount into our funds, meaning, we are also very aligned with Our LPs.  Internally, we have an undertaking that we call Project Bright Blue, which has three primary objectives; one, we want to outperform the FRE expectations set forth for us; two, we'd like to pursue strategic acquisitions that complement our current best-in-class businesses; and three, we would like to trade at parity with or better than our closest peers in the public markets.  If we can achieve these objectives, we believe we can drive significant shareholder value over the course of the next few years.  Finally, before I turn the call over to Marc, I\u2019d be remised if I didn't spend a moment on something that carries a lot of weight for us as a management team, which is culture. We\u2019ve built our firm on a culture of being launched entrepreneurial and nimble in treating everyone with respect.  As we've grown, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time and effort focused on maintaining these core tenets and we believe it has been and will continue to be a key differentiator for Blue Owl in our investment performance and our financial results.  With that, I will turn it over to Marc and Michael who will provide their perspectives on the state of the alternatives industry today and then will cover business performance for the quarter.  Thank you very much. Marc, I'll turn it over to you. \nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thanks, Doug. I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to our new and prospective public shareholders. One of the questions, we get most often when we meet with shareholders now is this, how do we expect the alternatives industry to continue to evolve? And how does Blue Owl\u2019s business fit within that evolution?  So, before I provide some background on our Direct Lending business and talk about where we're going, I thought I\u2019d take a step back and share some thoughts on the broader alternatives industry. I think you all know well the tailwinds that support the continued growth for alternative asset managers, investors are looking for attractive risk-adjusted returns in a market where that can be very hard to find.  Allocations to alternatives have continued to rise as investors realize they can trade some amount of liquidity for excess returns and for what we believe is a much better overall risk-adjusted return. As more traditional \u201calternative products\u201d such as private equity and real assets have grown, new alternatives, market segments such as Direct Lending, GP minority stakes and secondaries and co-investments have really emerged and flourished.  At a high level, Blue Owl\u2019s role in the market is to provide capital to the alternatives ecosystem, which continues to expand in size, scale and complexity. And while the larger alternatives industry continues to grow at a robust 12% average annual growth rate, areas such as Direct Lending and GP minority stakes are expected to grow even more quickly.  So, let's break that down for Direct Lending. By some estimates, there is $1.5 trillion of dry powder just in private equity alone and $3.3 trillion across private markets more broadly with more been raised every day. Now compare that to the size of the entire Direct Lending market with just over $300 billion total across drawdown funds and public and private BDCs.  When you consider that Direct Lending continues to take market share within the credit space, that suggests some very strong growth ahead for the Direct Lending industry with great visibility, which really brings me to the background on Owl Rock. So when we came up with the idea of building a market leader in growing Direct Lending and formed Owl Rock, we set some very big goals for ourselves.  Sitting here today, I think we have both met and surpassed those goals. We've grown our Direct Lending AUM to $31 billion in under six years and the strong pace of growth reflects the demand we've seen from LPs for the products that we offer and the need for capital in the companies in which we invest. It also shows investors\u2019 great need for yield in this market environment.  Today, we offer four investment strategies, our largest being diversified lending with $20 billion of AUM. We also have dedicated technology, first lien and opportunistic lending strategies, each of which is growing very nicely. We believe our technology lending strategy, which we launched back in 2018 and has now grown over $6 billion in AUM is already the market leader in providing structured solutions to the upper middle market technology industry.  There continues to be a tremendous opportunity for tech, particularly given the outstanding 13.5% net IRR for our tech BDC with zero losses since inception and not a single non-accrual.  Now, it's one thing to raise large pools of capital and another to put it to work in a disciplined thoughtful way. While we've originated $35 billion of loans since inception with gross originations over $5 billion this quarter alone, I think it's notable that our broad ecosystem allows us to be extremely selective in the deals that we do.  To provide some context, we've looked at over 5,800 deals since inception and just over 300 of those have made it to the finish line. We have a very wide funnel for deals that continues to grow, but we invest in only the highest conviction investment opportunities that we see, which is about 5% of the deals reviewed.  Our discipline and diligence doesn't end there, we perform a rigorous portfolio monitoring with a focus on capital preservation and we will remain in continuous close contact with the sponsors and the management teams. This meticulous focus on downside protection and portfolio management really worked to our advantage as the U.S. and global economies shutdown down during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The fact that we were often the only lender for a borrower or one of a few made it easier to provide dedicated support and to have timely comprehensive discussions about liquidity, covenants and potential credit events that could arise from this unprecedented situation. We made it through the pandemic thus far with very strong performance.  We have had only two realized losses associated with a total of $255 million of notional value in loans relative to the $35 billion of origination in our firm's history. Ultimately, the pandemic was a very important test for our platform that we fortunately passed with flying colors thus far.  Across the Direct Lending platform, annualized realized losses have been just five basis points since the inception of our firm, outperforming what investors can get in the public markets and putting us amongst the very top of our peer group.  Looking ahead, and I don't mean to sound Pollyannaish about our growth prospects, but we really do see tremendous runway to continue expanding our Direct Lending business. We've grown to $31 billion of AUM, but we are still very small relative to total market opportunity and our pipeline looks very strong.  Sponsors like our business model, because we can provide flexible and bespoke lending solutions at scale. We can act quickly and we have permanent capital. So borrowers and sponsors don't have to worry about our funds coming to the end of their investment periods. We're singularly focused on lending, which means we are not competing with their private equity businesses.  And if the portfolio companies need to borrow more to do a transaction or fund incremental growth, that's easy for us to do, because we've been in constant dialogue and we can underwrite something in a very timely fashion. So, there are a number of avenues that will drive our future growth. One is expansion of our sponsor relationships.  We have over 500 relationships today and we expect that number and depth to increase meaningfully in part due to the synergies we see with the GP Capital Solutions business. As for existing relationships, we expect to grow with them as the sponsor raise larger funds and expand their product offering.  Meaningfully, as borrowers see the benefits of having that one-on-one relationship, which was very clearly on display during the pandemic and we will certainly continue to pursue adjacent opportunities in terms of future growth, new product launches, and new investment strategies.  With that, please let me turn it to my partner, Michael to discuss the GP Solutions business in more detail. \nMichael Rees: Thank you, Marc. Let me start by framing the market opportunity in the GP Solutions space and provide some additional color about the history of the Dyal business and then I'll spend a minute on how the business is doing and where we are going from here.  Since our founding in 2010, the Dyal team recognized the tremendous growth in the alternative segment and saw a need for growth capital to assist founders and management teams in achieving their business objectives. We launched the Dyal business to be the premier provider of such capital. The strong growth in the alternatives industry and the overall private markets was driven by institutional investors, increasing their adoption rate for the products that these firms offer.  With the industry's maturation, that need for our type of growth capital has only increased. We believe that these great businesses, investors in private equity, private credit, infrastructure, real estate and other similar strategies will continue to play a major role in the investment portfolios of institutions and individuals for decades to come. And we want to be the leading provider of capital at the GP level for this industry.  Our business model is quite simple. We raise permanent capital funds. We're raising our fifth as we speak, and we invest this money into passive minority stakes in the leading companies in the alternative investment space. We typically take passive minority stakes between 10% and 25%, which allows the investors in our funds to participate in what we believe to be the attractive economics of these businesses.  To Blue Owl shareholders, the ability to continue to raise funds to address this market opportunity, drives our fee income and we see a very attractive runway ahead. Across our five funds, we have over 50 minority states, and we believe we are the market leader in this category.  The overall private market industry totals about $7.5 trillion in AUM and is expected to approximately double in five years as leading players in this market seek to grow and expand their business, they will require capital to invest in their funds to seed new strategies and to grow their organizations. We've purpose built our organization to meet these capital needs from our funds, but also to provide strategic assistance to the firms we invest in.  The initial catalysts for an investment might be a firm's need for capital. But once on board, our partner managers also benefit greatly from our business services platform, which is a team of 40 employees dedicated to helping and supporting the growth of our partner managers.  Through this business services platform, we have created the ecosystem to support Dyal\u2019s partner managers in building their institutional networks and seeking to deliver best-in-class capabilities across all aspects of their business. The feedback on this platform has been extremely positive and we believe it has contributed greatly to our market-leading position.  Our investment pipeline has been very strong and we've been putting capital to work quickly. Notably, we've already committed approximately 30% of the capital that we expect to raise for Dyal Fund V through four investments and we only held our first closing for that fund last November.  We have a number of other attractive investments that we hope to complete throughout the balance of 2021. Our outperformance and the strategy for our fund investors has been extremely strong with a net IRR 24% for Dyal Fund III, which had its final close in 2016 and a net IRR of 62% for Dyal Fund IV, which had its final close in 2019 .  For our current fund, Fund V, we've already seen quite significant early results with the portfolio already marked 20% above where our capital was put to work.  Looking ahead, we continue to see significant runway for this business as private markets continue to grow at a robust pace, as institutional investors continue to allocate to the space and as retail and high net worth investors increased their allocations to alternatives.  In addition to this strategy, we are in the process of largely growing funds focused on GP Lending, co-investments and secondary investments. All of this will complement our existing minority equity investment strategy and benefit greatly from the deep relationships we have with the private market firms across all of Blue Owl.  Finally, we kicked off our business unit focused on investing in sports and media industries. Dyal HomeCourt, our fund focused on taking minority stakes and teams within the National Basketball Association, launched and has two existing minority investments. One with the Phoenix Suns and one with the Sacramento Kings.  With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results. \nAlan Kirshenbaum : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start off by first, pulling the lens back and framing our business for everyone. Then I\u2019ll take us through the relevant numbers and metrics for this quarter. When I get to the numbers, I'll make references to pages in our earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning. So please feel free to have that available to follow along.  At a high level, we have a very simple business model. One, we earn management fees to manage our BDCs and funds, which are [Technical Difficulty] to Blue Owl shareholders.  Of course, we care very deeply about how our funds perform. But unlike other wealth managers, the returns of our funds do not really matter to our Blue Owl\u2019s shareholders. That said, our strong performance has continued to support our fundraising goals. And three, virtually all of the capital we manage with permits. This also helps provide significant visibility into future earnings.  Now to break off this down a little more, we are a 100% FRE business. Our revenues come from steady, consistent, predictable management fee cash flow streams. We have built a strong high cash flowing business. 97% of our management fees are from permanent capital.  When we raise capital, it's like a layer cake, adding to our existing AUM. We are not on a hamster wheel having AUM fall away every quarter. We demonstrate best-in-class growth and best-in-class EBITDA and FRE margins. We expect to pay a strong competitive quarterly dividend with the potential to double our dividend by the fourth quarter of next year. We have a very strong balance sheet with a significant amount of liquidity. We are well aligned with our Blue Owl shareholders.  We as the management team hold about 25% of the outstanding shares at Blue Owl and we are well aligned with our BDC shareholders and LPs across our platform as we have personally invested a substantial amount in valor products.  To also touch on the key drivers of our short and intermediate term growth, these include, one, deploying the capital that we've raised as we generally earn management fees on the total assets of our funds for Direct Lending. Two, some of the products move into full fees after their initial fee discount period like our technology BDC products, and three, raising new equity capital in products like Dyal Fund V.  Okay. So let's get into some of the numbers and financial metrics of our business. Overall, we continue to be on track with the guidance we have previously provided for 2021 and 2022. As a reminder, our reported results include numbers for only half the quarter for GP Solutions. Since the transaction closed approximately halfway through the second quarter, while for Direct Lending, we are reflecting numbers for the full quarter.  Starting off on slide 10, in the adjusted Q2 2021 column, if we were to reflect the GP Solutions numbers on a full quarter basis, as if the transaction closed on April 1, 2021, our total revenues would have been $210 million, total expense is $78 million, fee- related earnings $130 million or $0.10 per share and distributable earnings $108 million or $0.09 per share.  We believe this is a better indication of the full earnings power of our business for this quarter. And I will reiterate our expectation to grow our distributable earnings by over 25% next year as we continue to raise and deploy capital across the platform.  Our adjusted EBITDA margins and our FRE margins were both 62% this quarter, assuming a full quarter for the Dyal business, making good control towards our target range of 65% to 70%. And our adjusted compensation expense as a percentage of total adjusted revenue were 29% this quarter, assuming a full quarter for the Dyal business already inside of our target range of 25% to 30%.  Moving on to our AUM numbers, you can see on Slide 12, we reported AUM of $62.4 billion, fee-paying AUM of $42.8 billion and AUM not yet paying fees of $8.5 billion. AUM grew 8% to $62.4 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by capital raising, deployment of capital in Direct Lending and portfolio appreciation across the platform.  Fee-paying AUM grew 7% to $42.8 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by capital raising and deployment in Direct Lending. As a reminder, for GP Solutions, we earn management fees when a capital is raised not deployed. And for Direct Lending, as I mentioned earlier, we generally earn management fees once the capital is deployed typically based on total assets.  AUMs not yet paying fees reached $8.5 billion This AUM once deployed corresponds to an increase in expected annual management fees totaling $120 million. For Direct Lending, the second quarters saw record gross deployments of $5.1 billion and net funded deployments of $3.2 billion. The difference being pay downs of existing loans during the quarter.  And our last 12 month deployment was $12.9 billion on a gross basis, and $7.5 billion on a net funded basis. So up to $8.5 billion of AUM not yet paying fees, I just mentioned, $6.1 billion is for Direct Lending. So, based on our average net funded deployment over the last twelve months as the deployment pace that would take us less than three quarters to fully deploy this capital.  Finally, I'll close out my remarks today with an overview of the firm\u2019s strong financial condition and some other closing comments. We have a balance sheet light model and as you can see on Slide 19, we have almost $600 million of liquidity as of June 30 with our long dated capital structure that is comprised of $700 million of 10 year debt and an undrawn on $150 million senior secured revolver with almost three years of maturity remaining.  Our net debt is approximately $250 million or approximately 0.5 times net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our Board declared a dividend of $0.04 per share for the second quarter of 2021, which is calculated by looking at the full quarter results I just mentioned, distributable earnings of $108 million and using half that number for our dividend payable since we closed the transaction roughly halfway through the second quarter.  Although our dividend policy is to pay approximately 85% of our distributable earnings on a quarterly basis, this represents a 100% for the quarter. Going forward, you should generally expect us to maximize the amount of our dividend each quarter with a target of 85% of DE.  Finally, our Board approved a $100 million discretionary stock buyback plan during in quarter.  To wrap up, when I look down the road, we believe our investment performance, how are focused on delivering institutional quality products across all distribution channels and the overall brand we've built will drive our growth for the future. We are still in our early days of entering new markets, growing our business.  And once again, I want to thank all of our stakeholders for joining us today. We believe our business to be a very differentiated story in the Alt space with a compelling financial model and we look forward to spending more time with all of you in person in the coming months and quarters.  With that, operator, can we please open the line for questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. \nAlex Blostein : Great. Thanks for the question. Good morning, everybody and congrats in the first quarter. So, first, I was hoping to start with a question around Direct Lending. Obviously, the pace of origination has been running well above historical levels and from the RCC call, it sounds like that base to sort of continued so far into the third quarter.  So, I was hoping you could expand on your sort of expectations for origination pace for the rest of the year. How Owl has been differentiating itself in the marketplace to make sure you gain sort of incremental share deal flow without taking excessive risk?  And I guess, secondly, Alan, to your point about the fact that it will take only three quarters to deploy sort of the shadow AUM here. How are you thinking about the sources of additional fundraising here to make sure that you have enough sort of dry powder to meet the need of the channel?  A- Alan Kirshenbaum  Great. Well, listen, thank you, Alex, for the questions. So, first off, the Direct Lending pace as you just observed really continues very robust. We continue to see activity this quarter that's at least consistent with the levels of last quarter and while the timing in any given quarter what\u2019s happening, what will close in terms of a new level and what'll will happen in terms of repayments it's hard to know with precision.  We're continuing to see elevated activity to the kind of durability question, again, understand that there is a notable rhythm to the pace of a certain number of investments. The backdrop is extremely strong. If you look at fundraising in private equity, we're now looking at probably about a 1.5 trillion from the dry powder and $400 million of year-to-date private equity fundraising, which is just tremendous. That is the demand equation for our product.  And our product in fact is really taking share within the overall financing environment. So, if you think about just be simple for a moment with that $1.5 trillion using the $1 of leverage $30 equity that's a $1.5 trillion of demand just for new financings coming into the marketplace predictably in some fashion over the coming years.  And we are well positioned to take I think substantial advantage of that. As you\u2019ve almost seen the size of financing that we are doing or growing, we're now taking there is now multi-billion dollar unit tranche financings. That's a pretty new phenomenon, but I think a durable one in all likelihood.  Add to that, the trillions of existing leverage financing in the non-investment grade market which have to be refinanced and really the TAM, so to speak, I mean, really not the constraint. It really has to do with, as you point out, maintaining our very, very careful discipline, which has been our hallmark as you obviously saw in our comments, our performance since inception on that is running platform-wise at about five basis points.  Really, I think that's to breed right and there. So maintain that discipline is key. We have every intention to maintaining that discipline, but we continue to see very elevated activity levels currently and certainly think there is probably underpinnings for that to continue for years to come. \nDoug Ostrover : And, hey, this is Doug Ostrover. Maybe I can comment just on growth in general in answering your question specifically about raising additional capital. Certainly, our biggest growth initiatives - our business is relatively simple and I like to think about it as we have five things we're trying to accomplish in the near term.  So one is, you mentioned this, get the $8.5 billion of assets that we've raised, we're not currently earning management fees on yet get that deployed. Marc talked about the elevated deployment levels. We think that will continue for the rest of the year hopefully for some time. And Alan touched on this that's one $120 million of incremental revenue per year.  Obviously, Fund V, which Mike will touch on at some point, I'm sure in Q&A, but our deployment there has been excellent. The existing funds, both the funds III and IV, the performance has really been exceptional. So, highly confident in that fund raise.  In terms of replenishing our capital, I think you know and we can spend some time on this if you'd like, we're getting ready to launch a retail product into the wire houses. And again, I'd like to maybe further in Q&A spend a little more time on this. It's called our core income fund.  And I think Blackstone has been raising $4 billion a month. We've been raising about $100 million a month and we think it's - we're early in the process. But we were hopeful we can exceed people's expectations with what we can do in retail. Then, I think you we have a number of BDCs that we're earning discounted fees on until they list.  Alan touched on our tech fund at some point that will go public and we think we have the ability to go out and raise additional BDCs. So, we're cautiously optimistic on what we can do in the next number of quarters. But, I think on those five initiatives, we are highly confident that you'll see us execute over the next three or four quarters on each of those. \nAlex Blostein : Great. Thank you, both. And maybe, just touching on the other side of the ledger and talk about the GP Solutions business and Dyal. So, Mike, I think this is probably for you, but one of the questions we get the most from investors is really about the addressable market for Dyal here.  Given the fact that the markets obviously very large, you mentioned $7.5 trillion in AUM. But as you think about what's really addressable for Dyal, and more importantly, how much in fee-paying AUM relative to your sort of $19-ish billion today in the second quarter. Do you think you will require to support the growth, I'll call it - call it, over the next three to five years to support the growth in this GP Solutions space? \nMichael Rees : Yes. Good morning, Alex. Thanks for the questions. We look at the GP Solutions space as one of the most underpenetrated spaces in all of alternatives. When you - when we estimate the TAM, the addressable market, we think it's about $500 billion of total capacity now growing to $750 billion over the next five years.  When you look at our fund, which we can come back to our current fund \u2013 we are raising Fund V, targeting a $9 billion cover and our competitors, which are substantially smaller and they are really only two major competitors. You are looking at a tiny, tiny percentage of the addressable market being met by the existing fund.  So, we see a really long runway, not just Fund V, but on into VI, VII, and VIII. And a lot of conversations that have been developing and percolating for years. It's quite often that a relationship of ours will take anywhere from three, four, five years to ultimately result in a GP stake. So, we have a really long runway and our eyes on the horizon and we think there is plenty of capital to raise and deploy over time. \nAlex Blostein : Great. Thanks again. And then, maybe be the last question for me. Doug, you mentioned this, but clearly there is a lot of interest and appetite in the retail channel for private markets funds. It feels like in the last two to three quarters, that's been a theme that folks have talked about for one time, but it feels like it's sort of finally here.  So, maybe spend a minute sort of what differentiates Blue Owl and your credit products in the retail channel? And sort of how you expect that to evolve over the next few quarters and years? \nDoug Ostrover : Okay. Well, if it's okay with you, and I just want to spend a moment on retail in general, because, I know you are familiar with what we've built. But I am not sure everybody else on the phone is. We've been in the retail space since we've launched and we've had really good success in the channel. As I mentioned, we're currently in the market with our core income fund.  Our sales have exceeded over $100 million month. But most of those sales have been in the independent broker/dealer channel. As I mentioned now we are expanding into wire house distribution. And then, we're expecting that to go well. But at this point, we are reluctant to get ahead of ourselves in terms of predictions. But I'm hopeful over the next few quarters we'll have some good news there.  But if you take a step back, there is no doubt. Retail is a huge opportunity. We believe it's as large as the institutional market, but with much lower adoption rates. I mentioned Blackstone earlier that had tremendous success. And I think I mentioned it was $4 billion a quarter.  It's actually they're raising $4 billion a month between their non-traded REITs and their credit product. So it gives you a sense of the numbers that can be achieved in these channels. So, we think our products are very competitive. Marc talked about our lending performance. We think it's a best-in-class. We actually think it's tough yet.  From day one, we built our platform to serve the institutional and the retail investors in the same way. This is different than many of our peers. If you look at what we\u2019ve built, retail and institutional own the identical securities at the same price. And we think that makes a big difference in terms of what the retail experience will be.  Our goal is to bring a true institutional experience to that retail market. So, we are really optimistic as it relates to retail. But again, we are not ready yet to make any big predictions. To give you an idea of scale, today, we have over 40 professionals focused exclusively on retail and I think by the end of the year, that number will approach 50 professionals. We're also building out our Asian and European retail distribution and we expect to raise a significant amount of capital abroad.  And then finally, we're currently only working on distributing lending products through retail and Dyal has some strategies that we think could fit really well in the retail channels. They are certainly the market leader and so, that's something that we'll also be spending a lot of time on, as well. \nAlex Blostein : Perfect. Well, thank you very much for taking all my questions. \nDoug Ostrover : Thank you, Alex. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt. \nPatrick Davitt: Hi good morning, guys. From Autonomous Research. So I guess, that you are stuck with the 2021and 2022 guidance, but if we take the $180 million of 2Q management fees, compared to the guidance like $956 million I think for the year, which is you are tracking well below that. So, could you help bridge the gap between the kind of 2Q management fee runrate and sticking with the 2021 guidance? \nAlan Kirshenbaum : Sure. Of course, Patrick. Thank you. It\u2019s Alan Kirshenbaum. So, the annual guidance - we are right on track for the quarter of where we expect it to be for management fees. You can't take \u2013 you can't take our annual numbers and divide by four for a growing business.  We should expect each quarter putting aside one-time items. Each quarter revenues and FRE and DE will be higher than the previous quarter with the growth that we've projected out and we expect of our business for to the next year, for the next few years.  So, this quarter, we right on top of our management fee numbers that we expected. Expenses came in a little lower and transaction fees came in a little higher. And so, that's really the headline story for the quarter. And what you should expect is, when - and Marc touched on this earlier, when we have elevated originations on the Direct Lending side of our business, you should expect higher transaction fees and the same goes the other way as we have lower originations you should expect lower transaction fees.  And so, 2Q, as Craig and I were on our call last week for Owl Rock Capital Corporation, we talked about record numbers for 2Q and we noted that 3Q will be roughly the same or it could be higher than 2Q.  So, as we think about the 3Q numbers for Blue Owl, we could have the opportunity to have elevated transaction fees again in three 3Q. \nPatrick Davitt: And is there still a fee holiday issue without Fund V, could you remind us of that? \nAlan Kirshenbaum : Of course. Yes, there is a fee holiday. So, Michael talked about $9 billion as our target fund raise for Dyal Fund V. We've closed that. That is subject to a fee holiday about $2 billion. And we expect there could be another $0.5 billion give or take. And so that fee holiday is for initial closures or those investors who were around the first close, but couldn't get closed for the first close. That runs through the end of this year. \nPatrick Davitt: Got it.\nAlan Kirshenbaum : And so, those will - all investors in Dyal Fund V will pay the full 2% fee starting Jan 1. \nPatrick Davitt: Got it. Very helpful. Great. Doug, you mentioned, I think the retail product running it about $100 million a month. Am I right that that's basically just one month at this point? \nDoug Ostrover : No, we have been - that's what we've been running for a while. But that's in the independent broker/dealer channel. And we are just getting ready to go into the wires. It will be in a few big wire houses between now and the end of the year. And then, I think you'll see this syndicate grow in a very meaningful way starting January 1. So, hopefully, as I said, we'll a lot more to talk about in the upcoming quarters.  But, we're cautiously optimistic. And based on our track record and the feedback we're getting so far, we're expecting it to go relatively well. \nPatrick Davitt: Got it. Thanks. And last one I have is a little bit broader. But - and I know it's early days and who knows what's going to happen and do you see? But do you guys have any thoughts on how a change in the carried interest tax rate could have on the cash flow of the Dyal portfolio? Is there any concern that could meaningfully impair the yields on those vehicles? \nMichael Rees : So, thanks Patrick. It's Michael. What really happens, when different tax legislation is proposed is that you have a tremendous amount of thinking and activity from the owners\u2019 perspective in planning out they will own and continue to run their businesses and it generates incremental activity, not just a pull forward of some conversations that may have been longer in duration, but also a number of players that get off the fence and do want to think about GP stake deals that wouldn't have actually done so.  So, we see a very strong uptick in the actual volume of opportunities for us, both near-term and medium-term. But as it relates to our investment yield, our investors are predominantly passive across all of the Dyal Funds. And so for that reason, look, at least any of the carriers interest legislation is proposed, to-date, it wouldn't impact a passive investor in a Dyal Fund.  So, it actually continues to have very attractive cash flow profile. It wouldn't be impacted or impeded by anything that's currently been proposed in Washington or quite frankly any of the European districts or jurisdictions, as well. \nMarc Lipschultz : And Patrick, this is, Marc. \nPatrick Davitt: Go ahead.\nMarc Lipschultz : I am sorry. To follow-up a thought and just a refresher which you know is to be true, but for Blue Owl shareholders, the underlying yields and performance in our products, whether on the Direct Lending side of the Dyal side within recent ranges really don't matter.  Remember, carried interest is zero percent of the revenues of Blue Owl. And so, while it is certainly relevant that we keep a close eye on it as it bears on delivering performance. And as you know Dyal Fund V, for example, is currently running over 60%. So I think we're feeling very good about that performance.  But that performance in earnest to the benefit of the LPs from a Blue Owl shareholder point of view, we are the picture shareholders for the SaaS offer we get paid a recurring fee to manage those products on a permanent basis. \nPatrick Davitt: Right. Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Doug Ostrover for closing comments. \nDoug Ostrover : Well, thanks so much everyone. It was a treat having some time to speak with you today. We look forward to working closely with all of you and hopefully continuing to seed your expectations. Thanks again. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Moving on to our AUM numbers, you can see on Slide 12, we reported AUM of $62.4 billion, fee-paying AUM of $42.8 billion and AUM not yet paying fees of $8.5 billion. AUM grew 8% to $62.4 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by capital raising, deployment of capital in Direct Lending and portfolio appreciation across the platform.  Fee-paying AUM grew 7% to $42.8 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by capital raising and deployment in Direct Lending. As a reminder, for GP Solutions, we earn management fees when a capital is raised not deployed. And for Direct Lending, as I mentioned earlier, we generally earn management fees once the capital is deployed typically based on total assets.  AUMs not yet paying fees reached $8.5 billion This AUM once deployed corresponds to an increase in expected annual management fees totaling $120 million. For Direct Lending, the second quarters saw record gross deployments of $5.1 billion and net funded deployments of $3.2 billion. The difference being pay downs of existing loans during the quarter.  And our last 12 month deployment was $12.9 billion on a gross basis, and $7.5 billion on a net funded basis. So up to $8.5 billion of AUM not yet paying fees, I just mentioned, $6.1 billion is for Direct Lending. So, based on our average net funded deployment over the last twelve months as the deployment pace that would take us less than three quarters to fully deploy this capital.  Finally, I'll close out my remarks today with an overview of the firm's strong financial condition and some other closing comments. We have a balance sheet light model and as you can see on Slide 19, we have almost $600 million of liquidity as of June 30 with our long dated capital structure that is comprised of $700 million of 10 year debt and an undrawn on $150 million senior secured revolver with almost three years of maturity remaining.  Our net debt is approximately $250 million or approximately 0.5 times net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our Board declared a dividend of $0.04 per share for the second quarter of 2021, which is calculated by looking at the full quarter results I just mentioned, distributable earnings of $108 million and using half that number for our dividend payable since we closed the transaction roughly halfway through the second quarter.  Although our dividend policy is to pay approximately 85% of our distributable earnings on a quarterly basis, this represents a 100% for the quarter. Going forward, you should generally expect us to maximize the amount of our dividend each quarter with a target of 85% of DE.  Finally, our Board approved a $100 million discretionary stock buyback plan during in quarter.  To wrap up, when I look down the road, we believe our investment performance, how are focused on delivering institutional quality products across all distribution channels and the overall brand we've built will drive our growth for the future. We are still in our early days of entering new markets, growing our business.  And once again, I want to thank all of our stakeholders for joining us today. We believe our business to be a very differentiated story in the Alt space with a compelling financial model and we look forward to spending more time with all of you in person in the coming months and quarters.  With that, operator, can we please open the line for questions? Sure. Of course, Patrick. Thank you. It's Alan Kirshenbaum. So, the annual guidance - we are right on track for the quarter of where we expect it to be for management fees. You can't take \u2013 you can't take our annual numbers and divide by four for a growing business.  We should expect each quarter putting aside one-time items. Each quarter revenues and FRE and DE will be higher than the previous quarter with the growth that we've projected out and we expect of our business for to the next year, for the next few years.  So, this quarter, we right on top of our management fee numbers that we expected. Expenses came in a little lower and transaction fees came in a little higher. And so, that's really the headline story for the quarter. And what you should expect is, when - and Marc touched on this earlier, when we have elevated originations on the Direct Lending side of our business, you should expect higher transaction fees and the same goes the other way as we have lower originations you should expect lower transaction fees.  And so, 2Q, as Craig and I were on our call last week for Owl Rock Capital Corporation, we talked about record numbers for 2Q and we noted that 3Q will be roughly the same or it could be higher than 2Q.  So, as we think about the 3Q numbers for Blue Owl, we could have the opportunity to have elevated transaction fees again in three 3Q. Of course. Yes, there is a fee holiday. So, Michael talked about $9 billion as our target fund raise for Dyal Fund V. We've closed that. That is subject to a fee holiday about $2 billion. And we expect there could be another $0.5 billion give or take. And so that fee holiday is for initial closures or those investors who were around the first close, but couldn't get closed for the first close. That runs through the end of this year. And so, those will - all investors in Dyal Fund V will pay the full 2% fee starting Jan 1."

            "content": "Thank you, Marc. Let me start by framing the market opportunity in the GP Solutions space and provide some additional color about the history of the Dyal business and then I'll spend a minute on how the business is doing and where we are going from here.  Since our founding in 2010, the Dyal team recognized the tremendous growth in the alternative segment and saw a need for growth capital to assist founders and management teams in achieving their business objectives. We launched the Dyal business to be the premier provider of such capital. The strong growth in the alternatives industry and the overall private markets was driven by institutional investors, increasing their adoption rate for the products that these firms offer.  With the industry's maturation, that need for our type of growth capital has only increased. We believe that these great businesses, investors in private equity, private credit, infrastructure, real estate and other similar strategies will continue to play a major role in the investment portfolios of institutions and individuals for decades to come. And we want to be the leading provider of capital at the GP level for this industry.  Our business model is quite simple. We raise permanent capital funds. We're raising our fifth as we speak, and we invest this money into passive minority stakes in the leading companies in the alternative investment space. We typically take passive minority stakes between 10% and 25%, which allows the investors in our funds to participate in what we believe to be the attractive economics of these businesses.  To Blue Owl shareholders, the ability to continue to raise funds to address this market opportunity, drives our fee income and we see a very attractive runway ahead. Across our five funds, we have over 50 minority states, and we believe we are the market leader in this category.  The overall private market industry totals about $7.5 trillion in AUM and is expected to approximately double in five years as leading players in this market seek to grow and expand their business, they will require capital to invest in their funds to seed new strategies and to grow their organizations. We've purpose built our organization to meet these capital needs from our funds, but also to provide strategic assistance to the firms we invest in.  The initial catalysts for an investment might be a firm's need for capital. But once on board, our partner managers also benefit greatly from our business services platform, which is a team of 40 employees dedicated to helping and supporting the growth of our partner managers.  Through this business services platform, we have created the ecosystem to support Dyal's partner managers in building their institutional networks and seeking to deliver best-in-class capabilities across all aspects of their business. The feedback on this platform has been extremely positive and we believe it has contributed greatly to our market-leading position.  Our investment pipeline has been very strong and we've been putting capital to work quickly. Notably, we've already committed approximately 30% of the capital that we expect to raise for Dyal Fund V through four investments and we only held our first closing for that fund last November.  We have a number of other attractive investments that we hope to complete throughout the balance of 2021. Our outperformance and the strategy for our fund investors has been extremely strong with a net IRR 24% for Dyal Fund III, which had its final close in 2016 and a net IRR of 62% for Dyal Fund IV, which had its final close in 2019 .  For our current fund, Fund V, we've already seen quite significant early results with the portfolio already marked 20% above where our capital was put to work.  Looking ahead, we continue to see significant runway for this business as private markets continue to grow at a robust pace, as institutional investors continue to allocate to the space and as retail and high net worth investors increased their allocations to alternatives.  In addition to this strategy, we are in the process of largely growing funds focused on GP Lending, co-investments and secondary investments. All of this will complement our existing minority equity investment strategy and benefit greatly from the deep relationships we have with the private market firms across all of Blue Owl.  Finally, we kicked off our business unit focused on investing in sports and media industries. Dyal HomeCourt, our fund focused on taking minority stakes and teams within the National Basketball Association, launched and has two existing minority investments. One with the Phoenix Suns and one with the Sacramento Kings.  With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results. Yes. Good morning, Alex. Thanks for the questions. We look at the GP Solutions space as one of the most underpenetrated spaces in all of alternatives. When you - when we estimate the TAM, the addressable market, we think it's about $500 billion of total capacity now growing to $750 billion over the next five years.  When you look at our fund, which we can come back to our current fund \u2013 we are raising Fund V, targeting a $9 billion cover and our competitors, which are substantially smaller and they are really only two major competitors. You are looking at a tiny, tiny percentage of the addressable market being met by the existing fund.  So, we see a really long runway, not just Fund V, but on into VI, VII, and VIII. And a lot of conversations that have been developing and percolating for years. It's quite often that a relationship of ours will take anywhere from three, four, five years to ultimately result in a GP stake. So, we have a really long runway and our eyes on the horizon and we think there is plenty of capital to raise and deploy over time. So, thanks Patrick. It's Michael. What really happens, when different tax legislation is proposed is that you have a tremendous amount of thinking and activity from the owners' perspective in planning out they will own and continue to run their businesses and it generates incremental activity, not just a pull forward of some conversations that may have been longer in duration, but also a number of players that get off the fence and do want to think about GP stake deals that wouldn't have actually done so.  So, we see a very strong uptick in the actual volume of opportunities for us, both near-term and medium-term. But as it relates to our investment yield, our investors are predominantly passive across all of the Dyal Funds. And so for that reason, look, at least any of the carriers interest legislation is proposed, to-date, it wouldn't impact a passive investor in a Dyal Fund.  So, it actually continues to have very attractive cash flow profile. It wouldn't be impacted or impeded by anything that's currently been proposed in Washington or quite frankly any of the European districts or jurisdictions, as well."

            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Doug. I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to our new and prospective public shareholders. One of the questions, we get most often when we meet with shareholders now is this, how do we expect the alternatives industry to continue to evolve? And how does Blue Owl's business fit within that evolution?  So, before I provide some background on our Direct Lending business and talk about where we're going, I thought I'd take a step back and share some thoughts on the broader alternatives industry. I think you all know well the tailwinds that support the continued growth for alternative asset managers, investors are looking for attractive risk-adjusted returns in a market where that can be very hard to find.  Allocations to alternatives have continued to rise as investors realize they can trade some amount of liquidity for excess returns and for what we believe is a much better overall risk-adjusted return. As more traditional \u201calternative products\u201d such as private equity and real assets have grown, new alternatives, market segments such as Direct Lending, GP minority stakes and secondaries and co-investments have really emerged and flourished.  At a high level, Blue Owl's role in the market is to provide capital to the alternatives ecosystem, which continues to expand in size, scale and complexity. And while the larger alternatives industry continues to grow at a robust 12% average annual growth rate, areas such as Direct Lending and GP minority stakes are expected to grow even more quickly.  So, let's break that down for Direct Lending. By some estimates, there is $1.5 trillion of dry powder just in private equity alone and $3.3 trillion across private markets more broadly with more been raised every day. Now compare that to the size of the entire Direct Lending market with just over $300 billion total across drawdown funds and public and private BDCs.  When you consider that Direct Lending continues to take market share within the credit space, that suggests some very strong growth ahead for the Direct Lending industry with great visibility, which really brings me to the background on Owl Rock. So when we came up with the idea of building a market leader in growing Direct Lending and formed Owl Rock, we set some very big goals for ourselves.  Sitting here today, I think we have both met and surpassed those goals. We've grown our Direct Lending AUM to $31 billion in under six years and the strong pace of growth reflects the demand we've seen from LPs for the products that we offer and the need for capital in the companies in which we invest. It also shows investors' great need for yield in this market environment.  Today, we offer four investment strategies, our largest being diversified lending with $20 billion of AUM. We also have dedicated technology, first lien and opportunistic lending strategies, each of which is growing very nicely. We believe our technology lending strategy, which we launched back in 2018 and has now grown over $6 billion in AUM is already the market leader in providing structured solutions to the upper middle market technology industry.  There continues to be a tremendous opportunity for tech, particularly given the outstanding 13.5% net IRR for our tech BDC with zero losses since inception and not a single non-accrual.  Now, it's one thing to raise large pools of capital and another to put it to work in a disciplined thoughtful way. While we've originated $35 billion of loans since inception with gross originations over $5 billion this quarter alone, I think it's notable that our broad ecosystem allows us to be extremely selective in the deals that we do.  To provide some context, we've looked at over 5,800 deals since inception and just over 300 of those have made it to the finish line. We have a very wide funnel for deals that continues to grow, but we invest in only the highest conviction investment opportunities that we see, which is about 5% of the deals reviewed.  Our discipline and diligence doesn't end there, we perform a rigorous portfolio monitoring with a focus on capital preservation and we will remain in continuous close contact with the sponsors and the management teams. This meticulous focus on downside protection and portfolio management really worked to our advantage as the U.S. and global economies shutdown down during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The fact that we were often the only lender for a borrower or one of a few made it easier to provide dedicated support and to have timely comprehensive discussions about liquidity, covenants and potential credit events that could arise from this unprecedented situation. We made it through the pandemic thus far with very strong performance.  We have had only two realized losses associated with a total of $255 million of notional value in loans relative to the $35 billion of origination in our firm's history. Ultimately, the pandemic was a very important test for our platform that we fortunately passed with flying colors thus far.  Across the Direct Lending platform, annualized realized losses have been just five basis points since the inception of our firm, outperforming what investors can get in the public markets and putting us amongst the very top of our peer group.  Looking ahead, and I don't mean to sound Pollyannaish about our growth prospects, but we really do see tremendous runway to continue expanding our Direct Lending business. We've grown to $31 billion of AUM, but we are still very small relative to total market opportunity and our pipeline looks very strong.  Sponsors like our business model, because we can provide flexible and bespoke lending solutions at scale. We can act quickly and we have permanent capital. So borrowers and sponsors don't have to worry about our funds coming to the end of their investment periods. We're singularly focused on lending, which means we are not competing with their private equity businesses.  And if the portfolio companies need to borrow more to do a transaction or fund incremental growth, that's easy for us to do, because we've been in constant dialogue and we can underwrite something in a very timely fashion. So, there are a number of avenues that will drive our future growth. One is expansion of our sponsor relationships.  We have over 500 relationships today and we expect that number and depth to increase meaningfully in part due to the synergies we see with the GP Capital Solutions business. As for existing relationships, we expect to grow with them as the sponsor raise larger funds and expand their product offering.  Meaningfully, as borrowers see the benefits of having that one-on-one relationship, which was very clearly on display during the pandemic and we will certainly continue to pursue adjacent opportunities in terms of future growth, new product launches, and new investment strategies.  With that, please let me turn it to my partner, Michael to discuss the GP Solutions business in more detail. And Patrick, this is, Marc. I am sorry. To follow-up a thought and just a refresher which you know is to be true, but for Blue Owl shareholders, the underlying yields and performance in our products, whether on the Direct Lending side of the Dyal side within recent ranges really don't matter.  Remember, carried interest is zero percent of the revenues of Blue Owl. And so, while it is certainly relevant that we keep a close eye on it as it bears on delivering performance. And as you know Dyal Fund V, for example, is currently running over 60%. So I think we're feeling very good about that performance.  But that performance in earnest to the benefit of the LPs from a Blue Owl shareholder point of view, we are the picture shareholders for the SaaS offer we get paid a recurring fee to manage those products on a permanent basis."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Doug Ostrover",
            "content": "Thank you, Lian. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for our first Blue Owl earnings call. We are very appreciative of the time that you are taking to join us on our call today and we look forward to seeing you all in person, hopefully sometime soon.  Given that this is our first earnings call, I thought I would start with a brief introduction to the Blue Owl story and highlight our vision for the combined platform and the tremendous growth we see ahead. Marc and Michael will then provide their perspectives on what we're seeing across the industry before providing color on business performance for Direct Lending and GP solutions. From there, Alan will cover our financial results and then we will be happy to take any questions.  So, let me start with a very high-level view of Blue Owl's position in the marketplace. We are a leading solutions provider for the private markets with $62 billion of assets under management, of which $8.5 billion does not yet earned fees, but will once that capital is deployed. And notably, 97% of our management fees come from permanent capital. So, we have very high visibility into our earnings growth over the next six, twelve and even eighteen months.  We support the entire ecosystem of alternative asset managers through two businesses. Direct Lending, where we provide capital to sponsors to finance their portfolio companies and GP solutions. Where we provide capital to the alternative asset managers themselves, essentially, we are selling the picks and shovels to the industry. Or said another way, we are the equivalent of SaaS providers to the alternative asset management space.  Our long-term goal is to continue to expand meaningfully in these businesses and add additional capabilities that also fit this mandate of serving the private market's ecosystem.  As I think about the market landscape for Blue Owl today, I see two businesses, which are trying to benefit greatly from the continued growth in the alternative asset management industry. We remain in a historically low rate environment with investors searching for incremental yield and increasingly expanding their allocations to alternative assets.  As the alternatives world expands further, we expect Blue Owl to continue to take market share, as we provide capital solutions to these more mature larger segments of the industry. What we've also seen is that during challenging markets, such as the financial crisis of 2008, the managers with experienced investment teams and strong track records attract the most capital as investors worked to protect their portfolios. We firmly believe Blue Owl will fall into that category, as well.  In addition to the strong growth we see ahead for each of Direct Lending and GP Solutions on a standalone basis, us, we see significant opportunities for synergies between the two businesses.  Today, we have just 2% overlap in our LP base, which tells us two things; one, that our combined reach across the investor universe has grown dramatically through this transaction; and two, that there are many opportunities for us to introduce our LPs to unique yield and return opportunities that they may not have had on their radars.  We also see the potential for synergies on the investment side, as there will be times when Direct Lending can bring unique investment opportunities to GP Solutions and vice versa translating into additional value for limited partners and shareholders.  Given that some of the audience maybe newer to the Blue Owl story, let me back up and provide a brief history of our businesses. I am going to start with Owl Rock. We started Owl Rock with the goal of building one of the premier firms in Direct Lending. We saw a meaningful opportunity in the upper middle market lending space and knew that we could raise a significant amount of capital to address that opportunity.  We were confident that we could leverage our combined market experience and relationships to build a wide funnel of deals, select those with the best risk reward opportunities, create downside protection through disciplined risk management and ultimately generate strong returns for our investors. And we thought by doing all of that, we could create an institutional quality best-in-class lending platform.  Over the past 5.5 years, I think we've certainly achieved that goal. Our ability to deliver timely and flexible solutions in scale has resonated with the market, as we have originated $35 billion of loans since we started our business.  We've established ourselves as a leading competitor in the upper middle market lending space with over $31 billion of AUM and our strict underwriting, strong covenant and focus on portfolio diversification have resulted in industry-leading returns for our investors. COVID was an unexpected test for our platform, much as it was for the broader U.S. and global economies and we as a firm made it through this very difficult period exceptionally well.  The $35 billion we have originated has been across 300 investments. And we have had only two realized losses of original principals through June 30th with notion along those investments of just $255 million or less than 1% of what we've originated and we still own both of those investments. This speaks to the quality and resiliency of the portfolio.  We have built one of the largest dedicated Direct Lending investment teams in the industry with nearly 70 investment professionals, including 23 managing directors with average experience of twenty years. And despite the impressive growth that we've experienced in our Direct Lending business since we launched 5.5 short years ago, I truly believe the balance is still ahead.  Now turning to GP Capital Solutions. Dyal is the clear leader in its market having founded the industry and taken stakes in over 50 alternative asset management firms since inception and that number continues to grow. In addition to providing growth capital for new and existing businesses, Dyal offers great strategic value to its partner managers through its business services platform team and also offers debt financing solutions.  The partner managers in Dyal's Funds selectively manage roughly $1 trillion of AUM, giving Dyal a unique and very broad perspective on trends in the alternative asset management industry. We will endeavor to share the insights we partner from this special perch with you.  I think Michael and the team have built a terrific business and it really fits well with what we focus on at Owl Rock. We want to be market leaders in the space. We look for unique value propositions that allow us to generate strong performance for our investors and we like businesses where we can create scale. The Dyal business falls into all of those categories.  Shifting out to Blue Owl's financial profile and Alan is going to cover this in greater detail later in the call. We've had the benefit of watching with other companies in our space have done and we've seen what works and what doesn't. We believe the market has told us that it values a steady and predictable earnings stream with high growth potential and that's exactly what we offer at Blue Owl.  FRE currently constitutes a 100% of our earnings, meaning our revenues come from management fees, which are highly predictable each year. When it comes to AUM, we are not on the hamster wheel raising capital, because when we raise increment AUM we keep it since almost all of our AUM is permanent.  We are not required to return capital to investors. We like to think of it as a layer cake. As we raise capital, we just add a new layer of capital to our existing permanent capital base. Unlike most alternative asset managers, we don't have to raise $20 billion to grow our AUM by $10 billion since capital doesn't leave the system, and that's a big differentiator for our platform.  Because of this, we have industry-leading growth generated from highly visible drivers and best-in-class profitability in FRE margins. We have a track record of investment outperformance and diversified and growing distribution capabilities across the institutional investor and retail distribution channels. We offer a healthy 2.5% dividend yield based on our June 30 closing stock price and we are hopeful that our quarterly dividend could double by the fourth quarter of next year.  Our balance sheet is strong with almost $600 million of liquidity and we are committed to maintaining our investment grade ratings over time. And importantly, we have an industry-leading, fully aligned management team. We did not sell any shares in the transaction and we own about 25% of Blue Owl outstanding shares. So we are well aligned with our shareholders.  In addition, we, as a management team, have personally invested a substantial amount into our funds, meaning, we are also very aligned with Our LPs.  Internally, we have an undertaking that we call Project Bright Blue, which has three primary objectives; one, we want to outperform the FRE expectations set forth for us; two, we'd like to pursue strategic acquisitions that complement our current best-in-class businesses; and three, we would like to trade at parity with or better than our closest peers in the public markets.  If we can achieve these objectives, we believe we can drive significant shareholder value over the course of the next few years.  Finally, before I turn the call over to Marc, I'd be remised if I didn't spend a moment on something that carries a lot of weight for us as a management team, which is culture. We've built our firm on a culture of being launched entrepreneurial and nimble in treating everyone with respect.  As we've grown, we've spent a lot of time and effort focused on maintaining these core tenets and we believe it has been and will continue to be a key differentiator for Blue Owl in our investment performance and our financial results.  With that, I will turn it over to Marc and Michael who will provide their perspectives on the state of the alternatives industry today and then will cover business performance for the quarter.  Thank you very much. Marc, I'll turn it over to you. And, hey, this is Doug Ostrover. Maybe I can comment just on growth in general in answering your question specifically about raising additional capital. Certainly, our biggest growth initiatives - our business is relatively simple and I like to think about it as we have five things we're trying to accomplish in the near term.  So one is, you mentioned this, get the $8.5 billion of assets that we've raised, we're not currently earning management fees on yet get that deployed. Marc talked about the elevated deployment levels. We think that will continue for the rest of the year hopefully for some time. And Alan touched on this that's one $120 million of incremental revenue per year.  Obviously, Fund V, which Mike will touch on at some point, I'm sure in Q&A, but our deployment there has been excellent. The existing funds, both the funds III and IV, the performance has really been exceptional. So, highly confident in that fund raise.  In terms of replenishing our capital, I think you know and we can spend some time on this if you'd like, we're getting ready to launch a retail product into the wire houses. And again, I'd like to maybe further in Q&A spend a little more time on this. It's called our core income fund.  And I think Blackstone has been raising $4 billion a month. We've been raising about $100 million a month and we think it's - we're early in the process. But we were hopeful we can exceed people's expectations with what we can do in retail. Then, I think you we have a number of BDCs that we're earning discounted fees on until they list.  Alan touched on our tech fund at some point that will go public and we think we have the ability to go out and raise additional BDCs. So, we're cautiously optimistic on what we can do in the next number of quarters. But, I think on those five initiatives, we are highly confident that you'll see us execute over the next three or four quarters on each of those. Okay. Well, if it's okay with you, and I just want to spend a moment on retail in general, because, I know you are familiar with what we've built. But I am not sure everybody else on the phone is. We've been in the retail space since we've launched and we've had really good success in the channel. As I mentioned, we're currently in the market with our core income fund.  Our sales have exceeded over $100 million month. But most of those sales have been in the independent broker/dealer channel. As I mentioned now we are expanding into wire house distribution. And then, we're expecting that to go well. But at this point, we are reluctant to get ahead of ourselves in terms of predictions. But I'm hopeful over the next few quarters we'll have some good news there.  But if you take a step back, there is no doubt. Retail is a huge opportunity. We believe it's as large as the institutional market, but with much lower adoption rates. I mentioned Blackstone earlier that had tremendous success. And I think I mentioned it was $4 billion a quarter.  It's actually they're raising $4 billion a month between their non-traded REITs and their credit product. So it gives you a sense of the numbers that can be achieved in these channels. So, we think our products are very competitive. Marc talked about our lending performance. We think it's a best-in-class. We actually think it's tough yet.  From day one, we built our platform to serve the institutional and the retail investors in the same way. This is different than many of our peers. If you look at what we've built, retail and institutional own the identical securities at the same price. And we think that makes a big difference in terms of what the retail experience will be.  Our goal is to bring a true institutional experience to that retail market. So, we are really optimistic as it relates to retail. But again, we are not ready yet to make any big predictions. To give you an idea of scale, today, we have over 40 professionals focused exclusively on retail and I think by the end of the year, that number will approach 50 professionals. We're also building out our Asian and European retail distribution and we expect to raise a significant amount of capital abroad.  And then finally, we're currently only working on distributing lending products through retail and Dyal has some strategies that we think could fit really well in the retail channels. They are certainly the market leader and so, that's something that we'll also be spending a lot of time on, as well. Thank you, Alex. No, we have been - that's what we've been running for a while. But that's in the independent broker/dealer channel. And we are just getting ready to go into the wires. It will be in a few big wire houses between now and the end of the year. And then, I think you'll see this syndicate grow in a very meaningful way starting January 1. So, hopefully, as I said, we'll a lot more to talk about in the upcoming quarters.  But, we're cautiously optimistic. And based on our track record and the feedback we're getting so far, we're expecting it to go relatively well. Well, thanks so much everyone. It was a treat having some time to speak with you today. We look forward to working closely with all of you and hopefully continuing to seed your expectations. Thanks again."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of growth for Blue Owl. Capping off our first full-year as a public company. Since Blue Owl\u2019s entrance to the public markets, we have grown our AUM by 122% and fee-paying AUM by 107%, anchored largely by permanent capital. And over the past year, we have achieved over 40% growth on the key metrics we use to evaluate our business, including management fees, FRE and DE, and have maintained an industry leading margin of 60%. This extraordinary growth has been driven by robust fundraising in capital deployment, despite a very challenging period in the markets. Let me provide some color on our achievements that drove this growth. We raised $25 billion of fee-paying AUM in 2022 bringing us halfway to our $50 billion fundraising goal for 2022 and 2023. Notably in the third quarter of 2022 alone, we raised more equity in that quarter than we had the entire year of 2021, reflecting robust demand and the expanding power of our increasingly global and integrated fundraising platforms across institutional and private wealth channels. Our strategies appeal to investors looking for positive leverage to rising interest rates, income generation with downside protection, inflation hedging and access to the positive secular trends across the alternative asset manager space. And we continue to see strong demand for these investment characteristics. Not only have we had strong fundraising trends, but our redemptions from products that offer quarterly tenders have remained de minimis with just $186 million of tenders received on the $13.4 billion of fee-paying AUM managed by those funds or less than 1.5%. By contrast, inflows into those same products were close to $1.6 billion during the quarter. Private wealth remains a successful market for Blue Owl with healthy flows, despite a more challenging market environment. A testament to the attractiveness of our products and the relationships we've built in the space. In direct lending, we had gross originations of $22 billion for the year, just slightly off our pace from the prior year, despite a 20% decline in U.S. leverage loan volumes and a 42% decline in announced U.S. M&A transactions. This speaks to the increasing breadth and scale of Blue Owl\u2019s platform, as well as the importance of direct lenders in today's marketplace. Volatility and uncertainty have created an environment where other market participants are unable or unwilling to lend capital, despite the very attractive opportunities present today and we are benefiting greatly from that dynamic. In GP Capital Solutions, we deployed about $4 billion of capital completing transactions with world class managers such as Dragonair, KPS, Veritas and PAI and bringing us to 70% committed for Fund V. During the fourth quarter, we held a final close for Fund V at nearly $13 billion over 40% higher than our $9 billion target during a period that many across the industry have described as a difficult fundraising environment. And in real estate, we are now fundraising for our net lease strategy across multiple product offerings and we are off to a great start. We closed approximately $2 billion for our drawdown product during the fourth quarter and are confident in reaching our fundraising target during the first half of 2023. In this current market environment, what we're seeing is that the safety, inflation hedging, and tax advantaged yield characteristics of this strategy have resonated with investors. And the cost of capital relative to the public markets has resonated with companies. We're very proud of the substantial asset growth Blue Owl has achieved over the short period of time, but our goal is not to be asset gatherers, not all AUM is created equal and our focus is on raising very long dated assets with attractive fee and margin characteristics, where we can provide a differentiated experience for our investors. That is how we look to drive meaningful earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders and we believe that should translate into substantial value over time. And we look to do so in a way that is predictable and resilient to a wide range of market conditions, which is why our permanent capital base and FRE-centric model are so important. Since our Investor Day in May, sell-side analyst\u2019s expectations for 2022 earnings growth across our peer group steadily declined as the street adjusted its view of carried interest and other difficult to predict earnings trends. In contrast, expectations for Blue Owl were unchanged. Speaking to our differentiated financial profile, and we delivered on what we said we would do. Achieving our goal of reaching $1.3 billion of revenue in 2022. For the year, Blue Owl generated FRE growth of 46% and DE growth of 42%, while maintaining an industry leading 60% FRE margin. This is especially notable given the market headwinds present throughout the year, which impacted the larger financial sector. We have nearly doubled our dividend over the last six quarters. And as Alan will highlight in greater detail later, we are now moving to a fixed dividend that we expect to grow meaningfully over time. Our asset base is very resilient. It's based on permanent capital, compared to our peers who must monetize assets with turn capital and raise a new fund and hopefully larger fund, we generally hold on to the assets we have. So each dollar of incremental assets raised is additive to our capital base. This is what we call the Layer Cake model. On top of that, we have over $10 billion of AUM that will start paying fees once the capital is deployed providing incremental visibility into our earnings growth ahead. This is what we call the embedded earnings power of our business. All of this should sound familiar to those of you who already know the Blue Owl story. Although the public equity and credit markets have been volatile, although interest rates have moved significantly this year and although inflation rose swiftly and has remained persistently high, weighing on GDP and many corporate earnings, the core goals that we outlined for you at Investor Day back in May have not changed. And for those that are just getting to know us, we think the past seven quarters as a public company have proven out the predictability, the stability, the resiliency and the growth potential of our business. Looking to 2023, we're excited about the runway we see ahead in spite of the challenging market environment. We continue to progress towards the financial goals we laid out for our shareholders at Investor Day. We are committed to providing strong performance, attractive income solutions and downside protected returns for our fund investors. We continue to deepen the relationships we have with our current institutional and wealth partners and build many new ones. And we continue to innovate to stay ahead of the competition and drive growth for our shareholders. The market backdrop has changed significantly since we've been public and continues to ship. But we think Blue Owl\u2019s business was purpose built for this type of market. And our value proposition increases during environments such as these. That's not to say that these are easy environments to navigate. To fund raise through or to deploy capital into, it is truly a testament to the incredible efforts of our employees the invaluable expertise we have across the firm and the benefits we're seeing from bringing these businesses together. Ultimately, the way I think about our business is this. We operate a capital light model focused on substantial capital return to shareholders, supported by a very stable and growing asset and fee base. Essentially an annuity with growth and in thinking about our earnings profile over the next few years, the question for us is not as it is for many companies, whether we're going to grow, it's how fast we'll grow. That is the value of permanent capital and management fee driven earnings. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc to give you an update on our direct lending and real estate businesses. Marc?\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thanks so much, Doug. Throughout the fourth quarter, Blue Owl continued to play an integral role as a liquidity provider to sponsors in a market where capital has been scarce. We continue to see attractive opportunities at wider spreads and lower loan to values than a year ago, financing large and high-quality companies. In 2022, gross originations and direct lending were $22 billion, just 7% below our 2021 originations despite a meaningful drop off in industry volume. We looked at nearly 70 deals with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion well exceeding the over 40 investments of that size we evaluated in 2021. In the fourth quarter, gross originations were $3.5 billion and net funded deployment was $2.5 billion, a moderate slowdown from our year-to-date pace that reflected timing considerations and slower repayments. We remain constructive about the deployment environment and continue to see a robust pipeline for investment. Though we don't anticipate origination volume to look like the second half of 2021 and the early months of 2022, until there's a broader recovery in M&A volumes. Credit quality always remains a key focus for us and we have been very stringent in our underwriting standards from day one, closing on approximately 5% of the deals we've evaluated since inception. We have been focused on the larger end of the direct lending market, financing companies that are key strategic players in their respective markets. In addition, we've largely stayed away from cyclical businesses in sectors that we view as carrying greater risk. We believe this selectivity has benefited the investors in our funds and our loan portfolio remains in very good shape. Since inception, we have originated over $73 billion of loans with annualized realized losses of less than 5 basis points. And inclusive of realized gains, we've actually had annualized net realized gains of 3 basis points. Our weighted average loan value remains in the low-40s across our direct lending portfolio and in the low-30s across our tech portfolio. We've continued to see resiliency in the portfolio with ongoing positive revenue and EBITDA growth at the underlying companies, despite the headwinds of inflation. Now turning to performance, the direct lending portfolio achieved gross appreciation of 3.6% for the fourth quarter and 9.4% for 2022, outperforming the Leverage Loan Index by approximately 9 points and the high yield index by over 20 points for the year. Now moving to real estate. We continue to see high levels of interest in our net lease strategy from investors and companies alike. With corporate borrowing costs elevated and financing markets choppier, the attractiveness of a net lease solution has resonated and our pipeline of opportunities remains robust with roughly $5.1 billion of transaction volume under a lot of intent or contract close and a near-term pipeline of about 24.5 billion of potential volume. Inclusive of announced acquisition activity, we've invested or committed nearly all of the equity in our fifth closed end fund. Persistently high inflation remains a focus for many investors driving demand for a net lease strategy with desirable inflation hedging characteristics as the CapEx, maintenance, taxes and other expenses of owning real estate are borne solely by the tenant. Our latest open-end product, Net Lease Trust, has reached $1 billion of capital raised primarily through just one large warehouse platform and we look forward to continuing to expand the syndicate over the coming quarters. And we on the first close on our sixth drawdown fund for our net lease strategy at approximately $2 billion and expect to wrap up fundraising sometime in the first half of 2023. We achieved gross appreciation across our real estate portfolio of 4% for the fourth quarter and 20.6% for 2022. We think these are noteworthy risk adjusted returns for the very strong underlying credit profile of these portfolios. Particularly given the downside protection presented by the contractual income streams and the long duration leases. In summary, we continue to see very strong demand from investors for our income generating downside protected strategies across our direct lending and real estate businesses and we continue to find attractive opportunities to put capital work. With that, let me turn to Michael to discuss GP Capital Solutions.\nMichael Rees: Thank you, Mars. 2022 was a very successful year for our GP Capital Solutions business as we closed our fifth fund at a record $12.9 billion over 40% above our initial target. Making it the largest fund ever raised in the space. During the year, we deployed about $4 billion of capital into attractive opportunities, closing nine transactions and Dyal V across new and existing partner managers. This is consistent with our long-term deployment objectives and makes 2022 one of our most active years ever. We now have 17 partner managers in Fund V, constituting a diversified group of world class managers that we believe will grow substantially and benefit most from the growth and market share trends that shape private markets today. Given our scale, we remain focused on the largest firms within the alternatives universe. And those are the managers that continue to raise the lion's share of institutional and retail capital and we see this dynamic accelerate during years where the fundraising environment is more challenging. Through the third quarter of 2022, funds greater than $1 billion received roughly three quarters of the total capital raise across the industry, up from two-thirds in prior years. Total invested commitments were Dyal V, including agreements and principles, will bring Fund V to $8.9 billion of capital committed or roughly 70% of the fund. The forward pipeline remains strong and we continue to evaluate numerous opportunities that are quite attractive. Our business services platform, which provides strategic value-added services to our partner managers across key areas such as corporate strategy, talent management, ESG advisory and data science remained very active during the year. The team at BSP supported our partner managers with growth initiatives across their businesses, assisting with recruitment efforts, advising on new product launches and M&A and working with them on digital transformation projects among others. Performance across Dyal funds remained strong with a net IRR of 24% for Fund III, 51% for Fund IV and 37% for Fund V, all of which compare favorably to the median returns for private equity funds at the same vintages. Moving to our professional sports minority investment strategy, we have sold our minority stake in the Phoenix Suns at an attractive multiple. In addition, to-date, we have closed on over $500 million of commitment to the strategy. We're very optimistic about what the next 12-months hold for the GP Capital Solutions business. LP demand for GP stake remains high as demonstrated by our recent Dyal V fundraise and we look forward to expanding the breadth of our investor base even further with the next funds. From a deployment perspective, we continue to see robust interest from well-known and scaled alternative asset managers. We look forward to launching conversations with investors on Fund VI later this year and are actively working to expand our LP base further. Exploring additional strategic relationships and partnerships in wealth and educating our combined institutional investor base on the benefits of GP solutions as a strategy. With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2022, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation, so please feel free to have that available to follow along. To start off, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results. As you can see on slide five, we are right where we said we would be. And have achieved the goals we set out for ourselves in 2022. We achieved our goal of $1.3 billion of revenue, we achieved our goal of a 60% FRE margin and we track nicely in very tough and volatile markets against our goal of raising $50 billion of fee-paying AUM by the end of 2023, by completing the year 2022 with $25 billion raised pathway towards our goal. Some other key highlights include total revenues were up 47% year-over-year, FRE is up 46% year-over-year and GE is up 42% year-over-year. All of this was because we built our business differently than our peers. We built our business with a foundation of permanent capital and steady predictable management fee cash flows. Okay, let\u2019s cover our quarterly and full-year results. Our fourth quarter was another quarter of strong growth for our business. Management fees are up $24.1 million or 7% from last quarter and up 61% year-over-year. When you adjust for one-time catch-up fees in GP Capital Solutions. Broken down by strategy, direct lending management fees are up $21.2 million or 12% from last quarter and up 48% year-over-year. GP Capital Solutions management fees are up $1.3 million or 1% from last quarter and up 53% year-over-year, excluding catch up fees. And real estate management fees are up $1.6 million or 8% from last quarter. Compensation expense came in line with our expectations at 27% comp to revenue. G&A expense came in also in line with our expectations at $46 million for the quarter. For the full-year 2022, total G&A costs came in at about $170 million, placement costs being approximately $70 million of that and regular wage G&A expense excluding placement costs being approximately $100 million. As we think about 2023, we're expecting a roughly similar level of overall G&A expense maybe slightly higher with placement costs slightly down and regular wage G&A higher driven by the overall growth of our business. FRE is up $12.1 million or 6% from last quarter and up 46% year-over-year. Our FRE margin came in right on top of the 60% level that we've all spoken about on previous calls. And we announced a dividend of $0.13 per share for the fourth quarter up from $0.12 per share last quarter and $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter a year ago, resulting in a 30% increase in our dividend year-over-year. All of this is in line with our expectations and what we noted at Investor Day in May of 2022 and on our earnings call last quarter. Now I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts. We were pleased with our results for the quarter, in particular considering the strong headwinds and challenging markets the last six months. As a reminder, as you can see on slide 13, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we raised $3.9 billion and now in the fourth quarter of 2022, we raised $4.9 billion. I'll break this down across our strategies and products. In direct lending, we raised $1.7 billion almost $1 billion raised in our tech lending strategy and over $700 million raised in our diversified lending strategy, including almost $600 million raised in our retail distributed core income BDC, OR CIC. In GP Capital Solutions, we raised approximately $600 million as we completed the fundraise for Fund V. In terms of guidance for a run rate revenue number for 2023 for the GP Capital Solution strategy overall, I would think of that as around $550 million. In real estate, we raised $2.7 billion, $1.9 billion in our new real estate Fund VI. We generally expect to wrap up fundraising for this product in the first half of this year and we remain on track with our Investor Day goals for fundraising here. And $800 million for our net lease trust product, our new non-traded REIT. As it relates to our AUM metrics, on slide 12, we reported AUM of $138.2 billion, fee paying AUM of $88.8 billion and total permanent capital of $110.7 billion. AUM not yet paying fees was $10.8 billion as of December 31. AUM grew $6.1 billion to $138.2 billion, a 5% increase from last quarter and a 46% increase from the fourth quarter a year ago. Fee paying AUM grew $4.7 billion to $88.8 billion, a 6% increase from last quarter and a 45% increase from the fourth quarter a year ago. Both metrics driven primarily by capital raise in deployment and direct lending, capital raise in GP stakes Fund V, capital raise in real estate Fund V1 in the REITs and when looking at the growth from a year ago, the addition of our CLO business. Permanent capital grew $4.7 billion to $110.7 billion, a 4% increase from last quarter and a 40% increase from the fourth quarter a year ago. As a reminder, 94% of our management fees are from these permanent capital vehicles. AUM not yet paying fees was $10.8 billion, including $7.4 billion in direct lending, $1 billion in GP Capital Solutions and $2.4 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling over $140 million once deployed. As Marc highlighted earlier, in our direct lending strategy, we had gross originations of $3.5 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $2.5 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $22 billion with $14.4 billion of net funded deployment. So as it relates to the $7.4 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us about two quarters to fully deploy this based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months although our current deployment pace is a little slower than that. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on slide 21, we currently have about $1 billion of liquidity with an average 14-year maturity and low 2.9% cost of borrowing. Now let's spend a few minutes talking about 2023, both our P&L and our move to a fixed dividend. When we think about our P&L, we have previously stated our goal for 2023 was to generate $1.8 billion of revenue, double our 2021 revenues and would represent a 35% growth from 2022. We have previously stated our goal was to raise $50 billion of fee-paying AUM over the course of 2022 and 2023. As I mentioned earlier, we are halfway there through the end of 2022. The market backdrop is incredibly challenging though. And what we're seeing is a little of a mix shift in our fundraising. With some pressure on retail channels, but we're seeing continued institutional interest. We'll continue to update you, it\u2019s clearly a bit fluid, but we are tracking towards the $50 billion goal. And most importantly, we have previously stated in our goal for 2023 was to generate $1 billion of distributable earnings, which would be an increase of approximately 35% from 2022. And these remain our expectations despite the very challenging market environment we are living through right now. Now turning our focus to our fixed dividend for 2023, here's how we thought through it. As I just noted, we expect to post $1 billion of DE in 2023. We currently have approximately $1.4 billion of outstanding shares. That math kicks out roughly $0.70 per share in distributable earnings for 2023. We feel it's prudent from a capital allocation policy perspective to fix our dividend at $0.56 for 2023 or $0.14 per quarter to allow flexibility for capital allocation uses such as our share buyback program, funding GP commits and potential strategic acquisitions. And that comes out to an 80% distribution rate, in line with our policy of maximizing our distributable earnings payout ratio and a dividend yield over 4% based on our current share price. Based on our $0.46 in dividends in 2022, this year's $0.56 represents a healthy increase in our dividend of 22% year-over-year. Looking forward, we expect to significantly increase our dividend on an annual basis progressing towards our 2025 goal of $1 per share. So to wrap up here, before getting to Q&A, there are a few other items I want to cover. A final update on buying back shares for 2022. Over the course of the year, we bought back approximately 7.8 million shares for a total of approximately $81 million. On a separate note, I have commented throughout the year about the rising rate environment we're in and the potential impact it could have on our business. As expected, and in line with our previous guidance, we saw another increase in our Part 1 fees from the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter, included in our management fee line, our Part 1 fees from our BDCs increased $15.4 million or 25% from the third quarter. A large portion of this was driven by higher interest rates and some of it was from AUM growth in our newer BDCs like OR CIC and ORTF2. We are expecting to see some additional increases in our Part 1 fees in 2023, albeit at a much more modest level as interest rates begin to stabilize in 2023 from the large increases in 2022. Now to shift gears to taxes. So what the taxes look like in 2023? To give you some guidance here, it's best to remind everyone about our structure, largely because the formation of Blue Owl with a taxable transaction to certain shareholders, Blue Owl now has certain tax benefits that we will be able to use for a number of years. It's hard to predict what those benefits are year-to-year as for 2023, you should assume an overall tax rate in the mid-single-digits. As for \u201824 and \u201825 for now, we would suggest using a low teens tax rate. Again, taxes are hard to predict, but as we go through the year, we'll continue to update you on what future tax rates may look like. And finally, driving shareholder value. Earlier in 2022, we made a change to our voting structure which enabled us to be added to the Russell Indices and today we announced a fixed dividend for 2023. We believe that these initiatives will help drive shareholder value over time and this will remain an area of focus for us. So summing it all up, we are very pleased with how the year wrapped up. We delivered strong growth year-over-year in all of our key metrics: AUM, fee paying AUM, permanent capital, management fees, FRE and DE with each of these metrics up over 40%. As I think about all of the items I just ran through in my prepared remarks, I see them as a very strong message about our business model. In these times of market dislocation, volatility, and overall strong headwinds, we continue to demonstrate strong, predictable, high margin growth. Thank you again to everyone, who has joined us on the call today. With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. So maybe we can start off a little bit higher level given the first question just around the confidence on 2023 targets for you guys. So, obviously the retail backdrop is a bit softer and capital markets trends are not that's helpful. There might be questions just around ability to both, kind of, get to the retail numbers, but also to recoup some of the fee waivers and see some of the fee step ups that I think were originally incorporated in your, kind of, walk back from the investor day? So maybe put some meat around the bones on kind of what gives you confidence that you can hit the targets that you guys have outlined and sort of help bridge the gap from where we are now to what the goals are?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thanks, Alex. It's Alan. Thanks for the question. So we continue to look at our forecast, we go through it every quarter. We refresh it every quarter. I did mention that to your question or comment about softness on the retail side, we are seeing a little bit of a mix shift where retail we think. In 2022, we saw retail raise a little more than institutional and what we're thinking out of that $25 billion that was raised. And what we're seeing here today is the inverse of that, which is we raised the other $25 billion in 2023 and institutional raise a little more than retail of that final $25 billion. So we are seeing a mix shift in that, I commented on that. We don't know what the markets hold in terms of IPO markets or any of our products stepping up to full fees. But as you know, when we turn the lights on every year, because of the permanent capital base that we have 94% of our management fees are from permanent capital. We have a very steady predictable cash flowing business. And so we are expecting based on all the inputs that go into our forecast for us to hit the $1.8 billion of revenue, the $1 billion of DE and the $50 billion of fee-paying AUM raise.\nDoug Ostrover: Hey, Alex, just one comment. I just want to -- I think you know this, but just remind everybody look, we raised $25 billion last year and what I would describe as a really challenging and choppy market. We're not saying it's going to be easy, but as we go through and take a look at what we have in the market and do a demand assessment, both retail and institutionally, we feel pretty good about hitting that number. But I think you know this assets are clearly really important to us, but our ultimate focus is on earnings. And Alan mentioned this, we feel very good about hitting that $1 billion of DE in \u201823.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thank you, both.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: And the next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello there?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Hey, Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: So -- hello. So look, I wish you had even more dry powder. Because it sounds like the investing landscape particularly on the direct lending side is pretty good. So I wonder if you could talk to -- I think that in digestion in PE land for LPs is well known. Could you talk about the state of the lending backdrop, I would think given the availability of like much better yields on unlevered base is out there. There'd be a lot of demand on the institutional side and direct lending. But can we talk -- put that in a package for us? And how it feeds into obviously your confidence in 2023? Thanks.\nMarc Lipschultz: Absolutely, Glenn. So it's a great question. First of all, I share your wishes. We wish we had more dry powder also in direct lending. It really is an exceptional time. 2022, the intersection of credit quality, most importantly, in a global world, as well as spreads, terms, sort of all the intersecting components is as good as we've ever seen. And reflects itself ultimately in the roll direct lending played in 2022 and continues to play. You take a look at the largest take private transactions all of the year, about half of them were done by direct lenders. And quite frankly of those half, we were a lead in almost every one of them. And we really think the opportunity is tremendous. We think about just looking over a year, year and a half between base rates and then some incremental spread one gets today on an incremental loan. You go from a world of making an 8% unlevered to making a 12% unlevered to take senior secured risk where and in fact many of these were software, which we particularly specialize and lead in, you know, you are talking about loan to values in the low 30s. So all the way of reinforcing what I think your observation about the market, it\u2019s a very attractive time for us to deploy capital. And I would say institutions get that. We are seeing a lot of interest from institutions. But because they see the risk return, being able to generate double-digit net returns to take extremely high in the cap stack risk in an uncertain world is pretty appealing. So we are seeing a lot of interest on the institutional side. And we continue to see a lot of interest on the retail side. As Alan said, bit of a mix shift, but in many regards, yes, there's some turbulence in the retail market, but more than anything that mix shift probably reflects the strength of institutional drive toward this asset class and you see people talking about it exactly as that as an asset class now. For many people, it wasn't even an asset class before. So we're very, very positive on the outlook for institutional involvement in this, again, asset class this year and beyond for that matter.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Thanks. Sorry to hear you're not a KB fan.\nDoug Ostrover: Thanks, Glenn.\nOperator: The next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt: Good morning. Thank you. Just trying to think about what wealth flows could look like this year, and I understand it can be a volatile group of investors. Could you maybe update us on how the gross sales and redemption requests look so far in 1Q? And then secondly, how is the -- what is the visible pipeline for adding new platforms? And what's your best guess for the cadence of those coming online for each of the three big retail products?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thank you, Patrick. I'll cover the redemption side and then Doug will talk to pulling the lens back what are we seeing and how are we building our syndicates. So on the redemption side, we are seeing much lighter redemptions than others in the space. We have the similar 5% per quarter levels in our docks, and we're seeing about half of that come through by way of redemptions. And that's actually been pretty consistent the last three or so quarters in a row. And more importantly, on the net flow side, we are still seeing very positive strong net flows. So the net flows coming in, the gross flows are significantly above the redemption levels in each of our products. Doug, do you want?\nDoug Ostrover: Sure. Thanks, Patrick. So look, we really weren't that surprised to see wealth flows slow down during \u201922. The markets were incredibly volatile. And I -- when we got into this seven, eight years ago, we never thought it was going to be a straight line up to the right. And I can tell you, as an institution, we're still really excited about the opportunity. We still believe that over time, I can't tell you the exact amount of time, but over time, trillions of dollars are going to go from the wealth channel into the alternative space. And I think we are uniquely positioned to capture more than our fair share of that money flowing in. I think Alan commented during his comments, across our platform in the fourth quarter, we had $2.2 billion of inflows from the wealth channel, and we only had $186 million of redemptions. Let me say that one more time, $2.2 billion of inflows, $186 million of redemptions. We think that's pretty good. And as you think about the markets going forward, if they were to remain choppy or volatile, it's probably a good starting point for us. No guarantees, but I think what we've done is a couple of things. One, with the market pulling back, it's given everybody a chance to just catch their breath. And so we have been out, we've met with all the wire houses, RIAs, other distributors, spending a lot of time on education, and I think that's helped minimize redemptions. But we've also gotten a sense of what are the products they think they want to bring later this year, early next year? And I can tell you that, two things I feel pretty good about. One, over the next 12, maximum 18 months, you will see us introduce into the wealth space, a number of differentiated products. And two, and I can't give you exact numbers and timing, you will see us significantly increase the syndicate for our products that are currently in the market. So net-net, we are still unbelievably bullish, and we're pleased with how we're performing in this difficult market.\nPatrick Davitt: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nBrian McKenna: Great, thanks. So I appreciate the color around the dividend and payout ratio. So if I assume an 80% payout ratio on your 2025 dividend of $1, that implies $1.25 of EPS or about 35% EPS growth annually in 2024 and 2025? So could you maybe just talk about some of the underlying drivers that will ultimately get you to these figures?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure, Brian. Thank you. I appreciate the question. Look, we spent a lot of time going through. As I mentioned earlier, the forecast, in particular, for 2023, but we certainly refreshed on 2025, I wouldn't lock in an 80% distribution rate. We -- I expect that we will move around over time up and down from the 85% level that we were at in 2022. So this year, we're going to do a little lower 80%. You could certainly see us going higher from 85% to 90%-plus in future years. It really depends on capital allocation, how much we want to hold back depending on things we're talking about at the management table, so that's one. And look, we have a lot of exciting products that Doug and Marc and Michael have talked about on this call and on previous calls, something like GP Stakes Fund VI. We're doing a lot in the Real Estate business right now, both for Real Estate Fund VI and the new REIT that we just launched later last year. And then in the Direct Lending business, we have a number of new product rollouts as well. So we would continue to expect to grow our business year-over-year at pretty substantial growth rates and be able to put up that dollar share dividend that we've all talked about in 2025.\nBrian McKenna: Helpful. Thanks, Alan.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Of course. Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: The next question is from Adam Beatty with UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to ask about some of the underlying performance in the Direct Lending book. A lot of the questions and concerns we have from investors is around sort of credit quality and recognize that you guys have had really de minimis loss rates over the years, offset by gains, et cetera. But just in terms of the underlying portfolio, whether it's maybe nonaccrual rates or EBITDA growth of the portfolio companies or anything else you could give just to give some color and support around the performance of the portfolio? Thanks.\nMarc Lipschultz: More than happy to. Credit quality has always been and will be the central focus for the Blue Owl credit strategies, that's really what we live and breathe. Look, that matters a tremendous amount to us. We focus on it intensely. And tank fluid vanilla to deliver world-class results in it. I do want to say before I jump into the answers to your question, for a Blue Owl shareholder, it doesn't actually matter. Remember, you get paid fees, we have a feed-only business, and fee-only business from permanent capital. Now again, it matters a lot to us because this is what we live and breathe and how we deliver for our LPs. But I just want to remind us, depending on exactly where you sit -- and in this case as Blue Owl shareholder, it doesn't actually impact you. With that said, our credit quality remains very strong. We continue to see very strong portfolio performance. That is to say, if we look at revenue and EBITDA growth year-over-year, it continues to be very strong across the portfolio on average. We have not seen any material increase in amendment request. We have not seen a material increase in amendment request. We continue to monitor the portfolio, but it continues to perform on average very well. Look, of course, it's an uncertain environment. So I don't say that as if we're not sitting here spending every day thinking about what happens if what happens if, because that's indeed where we spend our time and where we should spend our time. But we are not seeing it in the underlying performance of the companies or the portfolio today. I think we only have three companies total on non-accrual across our very large platform. So I think we all continue to feel very good about the underwriting that got us here in the first place and the performance of the portfolio from there. And just to pull back up and cap it off on the numbers, look, if you look sitting here today, we've originated about $73 billion in loans since inception. And we continue, as we sit here, to run at an average annualized loss rate of less than 5 basis points. And in fact, when you take into account gains in those portfolios as well, we actually have a net realized gain of 3 basis points. So really continues to be our strength, and we'll continue to be vigilant, and we'll continue to plan for darker days, but we're in a good place as we head into that.\nAdam Beatty: Excellent. Thank you, Marc for the detail and the context. Appreciate it.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. One of the stats you gave is that you closed on -- or you've closed on 5% of deals that you've looked at since inception. I guess, how did that statistic look in, say, the second half of 2022? And how did it vary between more general lending versus tech lending? And then along the same lines, what are you seeing from the banks in terms of reengagement in Direct Lending as we start the year? And is the 5% close what you'd expect to see for 2023?\nMarc Lipschultz: It's generally been steady. I mean, look, there's certainly variances quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, but no pattern narrow of note that we've observed recently. I would say statistic, we obviously pay a lot of attention to. I would say this, listen, we'd be perfectly happy if the mix of deals was so great, but the number was higher. Look, we're always going to do it, maybe days will be lower, maybe days will be higher. The key is to see a tremendous amount of investment opportunity and be extremely selective. And so whatever that lands to mathematically is more, of course, output than an input. And we continue to really like what we're seeing. There's no doubt that M&A volume, of course, when I said this earlier in my earlier comments, obviously, M&A volume is down. PE activity is down, and we're not going to defy that. And obviously, our originations therefore -- in Q4, originations as we enter this new year are lower than they were if you look at comparable times a year ago. So we don't live in a vacuum, but the quality of what we're seeing and the sort of selectivity we can still apply by having 100 people that spend every day out originating and looking at and underwriting and having built these relationships. We have credits that now we've known are in our system. They're likely to stay in our system even when those companies get sold. There's just -- there's a lot of forces at work that benefit us as an incumbent and someone that's proven to be a really reliable partner to so many great firms and great companies. So that's all kind of the context, I'd say, to selectivity. The -- what was the second part of the question?\nKen Worthington: On the banks?\nMarc Lipschultz: The banks. Yes, so listen, it's a big world out there, right? It's a multi-trillion-dollar credit market, and I know a lot of stories are about the banks versus the private lenders. It's a world that needs both. Now today, the private lenders and frankly, during COVID, proved to be the stabilizing force for the market. And this is an interesting change if we think about the arc of 20-years, which is today, the private lenders, ourselves and a couple of others of real scale, are the ones that are consistently available to commercial users. And the public markets come and go. So we actually stabilize the capital markets and the economy in a way that, frankly, the public markets used to. The banks play a role in syndication. Today, they obviously are sitting on many tens of billions of dollars of paper, they need to work through. So we do not see a meaningfully active syndicated market. It was really nearly nonexistent so to speak of in the fourth quarter. So this has been a time where we've certainly taking up a lot of that slack and therefore, share, but there'll be plenty of room for both in the world over time.\nKen Worthington: Okay, great. Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. If we can zoom back in on retail, can you maybe characterize how you're sensing that risk appetite? Obviously, the tougher environment, but we do have a couple of quarters of positive markets. Do you think that is improving the risk appetite near-term or people are remaining cautious? And then kind of contrasting that with the conversations that you're having with the gatekeepers of the platform, are they also cautious or more likely to embrace some of your differentiated products, including Real Estate? And I don't know if you can comment on -- you mentioned some new products that you might be rolling out over the next 12 to 18 months. I don't know if you're able to comment on any of those, but any color would be great?\nDoug Ostrover: All right. That's a lot for me to try to hit. So in terms of new products, unfortunately, we'll announce them as we roll them out. In terms of risk appetite at the firms, they really want new, interesting, differentiated type of strategies. And the reason the firms, the gatekeepers want it because that's what the end customers want. They want things that will allow them to allow the wire houses, in particular, to differentiate themselves with their client bases. So they have been very receptive. Now we haven't rolled any of these out. But I think, hopefully, in the next quarter or two, we'll announce at least one and maybe two that we'll be working on. In terms of the risk appetite, the retail investor, it's too early to say with the market up year-to-date. Our flows are still decent, but we haven't seen a big uptick or downtick. But I -- my guess would be, if the market stays robust, we will see risk appetite increase and you should expect flows to increase with the market going up. But really hard to predict the mindset. But I just want to go back to what I said earlier. We're unbelievably bullish about the opportunity. I know there's this focus on quarter-over-quarter, but we're thinking year-over-year. And I will tell you as we go out and we talk to those gatekeepers in particular and some of the largest advisers, they are all very focused on all. So I think we're in the right place. We're well situated, and as I said earlier, I would anticipate we continue to get more than our fair share in the space.\nMarc Lipschultz: And one thing I could add, it's far from a monolith, this idea of retail products or individual access points. There's a lot of difference in these products, even if by headline, they have the same names. Our products, which have been the Blue Owl brand, the Blue Owl place within the system, is all built around products that are about stability, predictability and very strong yields. Remember, in our credit products, we talked about the strength of the credit performance before, we've also been raising the distribution rates. I mean, how many products, how many asset classes in 2022 where people call in investors and saying, I want to let you know the returns are going to be better than you thought. I mean that's not a common threat. And even when we talk about real estate, definitely not a model if you remember, our real estate strategy is very, very different from what else is in the market. Triple-net lease, long-dated commitments from extremely high credit quality counterparties, where you take all of your expenses and costs and pass them through to the tenant. And you're not talking about trying to buy a building and re-lease it or hope it stays leased and deal with operating expenses and vacancies and therefore and hope for a better cap rate. None of that is part of our model. Our model is 15, 20-year leases on critical assets to critical clients. And our product, for example, pays a 7% yield with tax advantaged attributes for many investors. So it's just totally different even though it lives under the word real estate. So even within these categories, there are real differences that I think play to our strength, and we'll continue to develop new products, as Doug said, that hopefully continue that streak of delivering something different to our partner managers.\nBrian Bedell: That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks Brian.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Brown with KBW. Your line is open.\nMike Brown: Great. Hi, good morning, everyone.\nDoug Ostrover: Good morning.\nMike Brown: So wanted to ask on the FRE margins. You achieved the 60% margin target for 2022. And Alan, you gave the G&A guidance for \u201823. So it sounds like the margin can continue to see expansion into 2023. But I just wanted to check if there any puts and takes we need to consider here? And then is there a target that you have for 2023?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the question. In 2022, what we saw was our 60% FRE margin. That margin is going to move around a little bit based on, in particular, placement costs, distribution costs. And so I talked about the mix shift. Doug touched on the mix shift as well. In 2023, I'm reaffirming the 60% FRE margin, that's what I think folks should look for and frankly, expect of us in 2023. That can move up or down a little bit based on where we ultimately end up for placement costs. If -- we continue to see the mix shift. We see a little more institutional than retail. Institutional takes a little longer to close. It's a little lower fee basis, but also has less placement costs. So if we continue to see that, we could see a little bit higher on the FRE margin. And on the flip side, if retail really comes through, maybe starting in 2Q, but in the back half of the year, in particular, we could see a little more in placement costs a little lower in FRE margin, but that also sets us up to certainly meet, if not exceed the $50 billion of fee-paying AUM raise. So there's a little bit of a push and pull when you think about FRE margin and think about the mix of our fund raise and how much is from the wealth or retail channels and how much is from the institutional channel.\nMike Brown: Great. Thank you for the explanation. Thank you for taking my question.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nChris Kotowski: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A question for Michael, and I guess, I just would love some -- a bit more color on the dynamics of the handoff of one fund from another. I mean those of us who are used to looking at the front tables from a normal private equity fund. We watch it get to like 60% invested and then they will start raising the next one. And then when it's 80% or 90%, it swaps over. But when I look at the fund tables in your most recent 10-Q, Funds IV and V -- excuse me, III and IV were only about 60% invested. And presumably, the rest of that money is spoken for, but not drawn. And Fund V is only about 11% invested. But you're already talking about -- so how should we exactly expect that -- how does the drawdowns and the dynamics of the handoff from one fund to the next work?\nMichael Rees: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. The -- what you really should focus on is the date that we quote turn on the fund. And that's when economics start to be paid to the management company. And we will then be out in the market raising capital for that given fund. And that can span a reasonable amount of time, upwards of a year or even two, but the fees are all the payable once the commitments come in. So I wouldn't focus as much on the amount of capital that's gone into each fund. We commit to deals of about 100% of each fund. So it's not like that money isn't earmarked for investments. It might not all go in the ground on a rapid fashion. There might be delayed payments that are paid over time. So that metric doesn't really impact the Blue Owl P&L. What we all focus on at the management company level is how much we've raised in total commitments per fund. And we've got about $4 billion left in Fund V. That's about a good annual pace for our deployment, and our pipeline looks really good. So it's going to mean that we're going to start talking to investors towards the middle to end of '23 about Fund VI. And the key question is when will we flip the switch and turn on fees for Fund VI, it's likely to be at some point in '24, depending on pacing of deployment for the rest of this year.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. But -- and by the time it flips over and turns over, I mean, let's assume you were targeting 10% or 20% more for Fund VI than for Fund V, but presumably, the first close would be some fraction of that, right? But...\nMichael Rees: Correct. That's correct. We wouldn't -- it's unlikely that we will have a one and done close for a big fund like that. It's not how we typically do it.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.\nMichael Rees: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: The next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt: Just a follow-up on the guidance this year. I guess, firstly, you mentioned the lighter deployment rate this year. What are you kind of assuming year-over-year in terms of deployment in that guide? And are you anticipating any inorganic growth in that guide? Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thanks, Patrick. Inorganics, I'll leave that to one of my partners to talk about. In terms of the fund raise, I think what we're seeing is a little or what we're expecting, I should say, Patrick, is a little lighter on the retail side and a little heavier on the institutional side. That balances out to raise the other half of the $25 billion in 2023.\nPatrick Davitt: Sorry, deployment, yes, that's obviously a part of the equation as well in credit.\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. With regard to deployment and credit, in particular, it's slower right now. As I said, we saw that in the fourth quarter. We see it now. We're not suggesting we have a crystal ball. But again, remember, with our permanent capital pools and with the variances, the deals we see, the investments we see, we really like. So our shortage, if anything, today, is really capital certainly not opportunity -- well, put another way, it's a shortage of capital against those opportunities. So the exact state of the M&A market in the second half, I don't really know. In terms of impact on P&L, frankly, that really only shows up in the, sort of, fees in the arrangement fees. So again, we don't predict that quarter-to-quarter. We're assuming a more tepid pace this year than we've seen in prior more robust years, and that's what our -- we're built on. With regard to inorganic, if you want a quick comment on that, look, we continue to be interested, but extremely selective in the idea of adding adjacent capabilities. When we add capabilities, there's things that are very much front of mind for us, which is, is it really a complementary product that suits our DNA and allows us to sort of deliver on the strengths of Blue Owl and across the platform? Is it a place where we can really deliver a market-leading role and performance? Clearly, in the spaces we're in, in GP Solutions, in triple net lease, we're the clear market leader in Direct Lending, one of a couple. And that's important to us that we'd be in products where we can really lead. We are not all things to all people. We want to be a handful of really good things to a wonderful side of investors. And then culture fit, critically important, take all that together, Oak Street is certainly a study in the kind of opportunity that we look for. We get a lot of inbounds, as you would expect, and we will continue to look. But that one, we can never predict when that will happen or won't happen, but we certainly continue to be active in the inorganic side as well.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Doug Ostrover for any closing remarks.\nDoug Ostrover: Well, thanks, everybody. We appreciate all the questions. We're clearly proud of our results for \u201922. You've heard us in the past talk describe our business using the words I think Marc touched on the stability, profitability and growth. And just to highlight the growth again, revenue, FRE, DE, AUM, all up well over 40% year-over-year. And I think you've got a sense on this call, we're equally as excited about 2023. And we're reaffirming that $1 billion of DE. So appreciate all the support, and look forward to talking to everyone soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2022, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation, so please feel free to have that available to follow along. To start off, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results. As you can see on slide five, we are right where we said we would be. And have achieved the goals we set out for ourselves in 2022. We achieved our goal of $1.3 billion of revenue, we achieved our goal of a 60% FRE margin and we track nicely in very tough and volatile markets against our goal of raising $50 billion of fee-paying AUM by the end of 2023, by completing the year 2022 with $25 billion raised pathway towards our goal. Some other key highlights include total revenues were up 47% year-over-year, FRE is up 46% year-over-year and GE is up 42% year-over-year. All of this was because we built our business differently than our peers. We built our business with a foundation of permanent capital and steady predictable management fee cash flows. Okay, let's cover our quarterly and full-year results. Our fourth quarter was another quarter of strong growth for our business. Management fees are up $24.1 million or 7% from last quarter and up 61% year-over-year. When you adjust for one-time catch-up fees in GP Capital Solutions. Broken down by strategy, direct lending management fees are up $21.2 million or 12% from last quarter and up 48% year-over-year. GP Capital Solutions management fees are up $1.3 million or 1% from last quarter and up 53% year-over-year, excluding catch up fees. And real estate management fees are up $1.6 million or 8% from last quarter. Compensation expense came in line with our expectations at 27% comp to revenue. G&A expense came in also in line with our expectations at $46 million for the quarter. For the full-year 2022, total G&A costs came in at about $170 million, placement costs being approximately $70 million of that and regular wage G&A expense excluding placement costs being approximately $100 million. As we think about 2023, we're expecting a roughly similar level of overall G&A expense maybe slightly higher with placement costs slightly down and regular wage G&A higher driven by the overall growth of our business. FRE is up $12.1 million or 6% from last quarter and up 46% year-over-year. Our FRE margin came in right on top of the 60% level that we've all spoken about on previous calls. And we announced a dividend of $0.13 per share for the fourth quarter up from $0.12 per share last quarter and $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter a year ago, resulting in a 30% increase in our dividend year-over-year. All of this is in line with our expectations and what we noted at Investor Day in May of 2022 and on our earnings call last quarter. Now I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts. We were pleased with our results for the quarter, in particular considering the strong headwinds and challenging markets the last six months. As a reminder, as you can see on slide 13, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we raised $3.9 billion and now in the fourth quarter of 2022, we raised $4.9 billion. I'll break this down across our strategies and products. In direct lending, we raised $1.7 billion almost $1 billion raised in our tech lending strategy and over $700 million raised in our diversified lending strategy, including almost $600 million raised in our retail distributed core income BDC, OR CIC. In GP Capital Solutions, we raised approximately $600 million as we completed the fundraise for Fund V. In terms of guidance for a run rate revenue number for 2023 for the GP Capital Solution strategy overall, I would think of that as around $550 million. In real estate, we raised $2.7 billion, $1.9 billion in our new real estate Fund VI. We generally expect to wrap up fundraising for this product in the first half of this year and we remain on track with our Investor Day goals for fundraising here. And $800 million for our net lease trust product, our new non-traded REIT. As it relates to our AUM metrics, on slide 12, we reported AUM of $138.2 billion, fee paying AUM of $88.8 billion and total permanent capital of $110.7 billion. AUM not yet paying fees was $10.8 billion as of December 31. AUM grew $6.1 billion to $138.2 billion, a 5% increase from last quarter and a 46% increase from the fourth quarter a year ago. Fee paying AUM grew $4.7 billion to $88.8 billion, a 6% increase from last quarter and a 45% increase from the fourth quarter a year ago. Both metrics driven primarily by capital raise in deployment and direct lending, capital raise in GP stakes Fund V, capital raise in real estate Fund V1 in the REITs and when looking at the growth from a year ago, the addition of our CLO business. Permanent capital grew $4.7 billion to $110.7 billion, a 4% increase from last quarter and a 40% increase from the fourth quarter a year ago. As a reminder, 94% of our management fees are from these permanent capital vehicles. AUM not yet paying fees was $10.8 billion, including $7.4 billion in direct lending, $1 billion in GP Capital Solutions and $2.4 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling over $140 million once deployed. As Marc highlighted earlier, in our direct lending strategy, we had gross originations of $3.5 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $2.5 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $22 billion with $14.4 billion of net funded deployment. So as it relates to the $7.4 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us about two quarters to fully deploy this based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months although our current deployment pace is a little slower than that. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on slide 21, we currently have about $1 billion of liquidity with an average 14-year maturity and low 2.9% cost of borrowing. Now let's spend a few minutes talking about 2023, both our P&L and our move to a fixed dividend. When we think about our P&L, we have previously stated our goal for 2023 was to generate $1.8 billion of revenue, double our 2021 revenues and would represent a 35% growth from 2022. We have previously stated our goal was to raise $50 billion of fee-paying AUM over the course of 2022 and 2023. As I mentioned earlier, we are halfway there through the end of 2022. The market backdrop is incredibly challenging though. And what we're seeing is a little of a mix shift in our fundraising. With some pressure on retail channels, but we're seeing continued institutional interest. We'll continue to update you, it's clearly a bit fluid, but we are tracking towards the $50 billion goal. And most importantly, we have previously stated in our goal for 2023 was to generate $1 billion of distributable earnings, which would be an increase of approximately 35% from 2022. And these remain our expectations despite the very challenging market environment we are living through right now. Now turning our focus to our fixed dividend for 2023, here's how we thought through it. As I just noted, we expect to post $1 billion of DE in 2023. We currently have approximately $1.4 billion of outstanding shares. That math kicks out roughly $0.70 per share in distributable earnings for 2023. We feel it's prudent from a capital allocation policy perspective to fix our dividend at $0.56 for 2023 or $0.14 per quarter to allow flexibility for capital allocation uses such as our share buyback program, funding GP commits and potential strategic acquisitions. And that comes out to an 80% distribution rate, in line with our policy of maximizing our distributable earnings payout ratio and a dividend yield over 4% based on our current share price. Based on our $0.46 in dividends in 2022, this year's $0.56 represents a healthy increase in our dividend of 22% year-over-year. Looking forward, we expect to significantly increase our dividend on an annual basis progressing towards our 2025 goal of $1 per share. So to wrap up here, before getting to Q&A, there are a few other items I want to cover. A final update on buying back shares for 2022. Over the course of the year, we bought back approximately 7.8 million shares for a total of approximately $81 million. On a separate note, I have commented throughout the year about the rising rate environment we're in and the potential impact it could have on our business. As expected, and in line with our previous guidance, we saw another increase in our Part 1 fees from the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter, included in our management fee line, our Part 1 fees from our BDCs increased $15.4 million or 25% from the third quarter. A large portion of this was driven by higher interest rates and some of it was from AUM growth in our newer BDCs like OR CIC and ORTF2. We are expecting to see some additional increases in our Part 1 fees in 2023, albeit at a much more modest level as interest rates begin to stabilize in 2023 from the large increases in 2022. Now to shift gears to taxes. So what the taxes look like in 2023? To give you some guidance here, it's best to remind everyone about our structure, largely because the formation of Blue Owl with a taxable transaction to certain shareholders, Blue Owl now has certain tax benefits that we will be able to use for a number of years. It's hard to predict what those benefits are year-to-year as for 2023, you should assume an overall tax rate in the mid-single-digits. As for \u201824 and \u201825 for now, we would suggest using a low teens tax rate. Again, taxes are hard to predict, but as we go through the year, we'll continue to update you on what future tax rates may look like. And finally, driving shareholder value. Earlier in 2022, we made a change to our voting structure which enabled us to be added to the Russell Indices and today we announced a fixed dividend for 2023. We believe that these initiatives will help drive shareholder value over time and this will remain an area of focus for us. So summing it all up, we are very pleased with how the year wrapped up. We delivered strong growth year-over-year in all of our key metrics: AUM, fee paying AUM, permanent capital, management fees, FRE and DE with each of these metrics up over 40%. As I think about all of the items I just ran through in my prepared remarks, I see them as a very strong message about our business model. In these times of market dislocation, volatility, and overall strong headwinds, we continue to demonstrate strong, predictable, high margin growth. Thank you again to everyone, who has joined us on the call today. With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions? Sure. Thanks, Alex. It's Alan. Thanks for the question. So we continue to look at our forecast, we go through it every quarter. We refresh it every quarter. I did mention that to your question or comment about softness on the retail side, we are seeing a little bit of a mix shift where retail we think. In 2022, we saw retail raise a little more than institutional and what we're thinking out of that $25 billion that was raised. And what we're seeing here today is the inverse of that, which is we raised the other $25 billion in 2023 and institutional raise a little more than retail of that final $25 billion. So we are seeing a mix shift in that, I commented on that. We don't know what the markets hold in terms of IPO markets or any of our products stepping up to full fees. But as you know, when we turn the lights on every year, because of the permanent capital base that we have 94% of our management fees are from permanent capital. We have a very steady predictable cash flowing business. And so we are expecting based on all the inputs that go into our forecast for us to hit the $1.8 billion of revenue, the $1 billion of DE and the $50 billion of fee-paying AUM raise. Thanks, Alex. Hey, Glenn. Sure. Thank you, Patrick. I'll cover the redemption side and then Doug will talk to pulling the lens back what are we seeing and how are we building our syndicates. So on the redemption side, we are seeing much lighter redemptions than others in the space. We have the similar 5% per quarter levels in our docks, and we're seeing about half of that come through by way of redemptions. And that's actually been pretty consistent the last three or so quarters in a row. And more importantly, on the net flow side, we are still seeing very positive strong net flows. So the net flows coming in, the gross flows are significantly above the redemption levels in each of our products. Doug, do you want? Sure, Brian. Thank you. I appreciate the question. Look, we spent a lot of time going through. As I mentioned earlier, the forecast, in particular, for 2023, but we certainly refreshed on 2025, I wouldn't lock in an 80% distribution rate. We -- I expect that we will move around over time up and down from the 85% level that we were at in 2022. So this year, we're going to do a little lower 80%. You could certainly see us going higher from 85% to 90%-plus in future years. It really depends on capital allocation, how much we want to hold back depending on things we're talking about at the management table, so that's one. And look, we have a lot of exciting products that Doug and Marc and Michael have talked about on this call and on previous calls, something like GP Stakes Fund VI. We're doing a lot in the Real Estate business right now, both for Real Estate Fund VI and the new REIT that we just launched later last year. And then in the Direct Lending business, we have a number of new product rollouts as well. So we would continue to expect to grow our business year-over-year at pretty substantial growth rates and be able to put up that dollar share dividend that we've all talked about in 2025. Of course. Thank you, Brian. Thanks, Adam. Thanks, Ken. Thanks Brian. Sure. Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the question. In 2022, what we saw was our 60% FRE margin. That margin is going to move around a little bit based on, in particular, placement costs, distribution costs. And so I talked about the mix shift. Doug touched on the mix shift as well. In 2023, I'm reaffirming the 60% FRE margin, that's what I think folks should look for and frankly, expect of us in 2023. That can move up or down a little bit based on where we ultimately end up for placement costs. If -- we continue to see the mix shift. We see a little more institutional than retail. Institutional takes a little longer to close. It's a little lower fee basis, but also has less placement costs. So if we continue to see that, we could see a little bit higher on the FRE margin. And on the flip side, if retail really comes through, maybe starting in 2Q, but in the back half of the year, in particular, we could see a little more in placement costs a little lower in FRE margin, but that also sets us up to certainly meet, if not exceed the $50 billion of fee-paying AUM raise. So there's a little bit of a push and pull when you think about FRE margin and think about the mix of our fund raise and how much is from the wealth or retail channels and how much is from the institutional channel. Thank you, Mike. Sure. Thanks, Patrick. Inorganics, I'll leave that to one of my partners to talk about. In terms of the fund raise, I think what we're seeing is a little or what we're expecting, I should say, Patrick, is a little lighter on the retail side and a little heavier on the institutional side. That balances out to raise the other half of the $25 billion in 2023."

            "name": "Michael Rees",
            "content": "Thank you, Mars. 2022 was a very successful year for our GP Capital Solutions business as we closed our fifth fund at a record $12.9 billion over 40% above our initial target. Making it the largest fund ever raised in the space. During the year, we deployed about $4 billion of capital into attractive opportunities, closing nine transactions and Dyal V across new and existing partner managers. This is consistent with our long-term deployment objectives and makes 2022 one of our most active years ever. We now have 17 partner managers in Fund V, constituting a diversified group of world class managers that we believe will grow substantially and benefit most from the growth and market share trends that shape private markets today. Given our scale, we remain focused on the largest firms within the alternatives universe. And those are the managers that continue to raise the lion's share of institutional and retail capital and we see this dynamic accelerate during years where the fundraising environment is more challenging. Through the third quarter of 2022, funds greater than $1 billion received roughly three quarters of the total capital raise across the industry, up from two-thirds in prior years. Total invested commitments were Dyal V, including agreements and principles, will bring Fund V to $8.9 billion of capital committed or roughly 70% of the fund. The forward pipeline remains strong and we continue to evaluate numerous opportunities that are quite attractive. Our business services platform, which provides strategic value-added services to our partner managers across key areas such as corporate strategy, talent management, ESG advisory and data science remained very active during the year. The team at BSP supported our partner managers with growth initiatives across their businesses, assisting with recruitment efforts, advising on new product launches and M&A and working with them on digital transformation projects among others. Performance across Dyal funds remained strong with a net IRR of 24% for Fund III, 51% for Fund IV and 37% for Fund V, all of which compare favorably to the median returns for private equity funds at the same vintages. Moving to our professional sports minority investment strategy, we have sold our minority stake in the Phoenix Suns at an attractive multiple. In addition, to-date, we have closed on over $500 million of commitment to the strategy. We're very optimistic about what the next 12-months hold for the GP Capital Solutions business. LP demand for GP stake remains high as demonstrated by our recent Dyal V fundraise and we look forward to expanding the breadth of our investor base even further with the next funds. From a deployment perspective, we continue to see robust interest from well-known and scaled alternative asset managers. We look forward to launching conversations with investors on Fund VI later this year and are actively working to expand our LP base further. Exploring additional strategic relationships and partnerships in wealth and educating our combined institutional investor base on the benefits of GP solutions as a strategy. With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. The -- what you really should focus on is the date that we quote turn on the fund. And that's when economics start to be paid to the management company. And we will then be out in the market raising capital for that given fund. And that can span a reasonable amount of time, upwards of a year or even two, but the fees are all the payable once the commitments come in. So I wouldn't focus as much on the amount of capital that's gone into each fund. We commit to deals of about 100% of each fund. So it's not like that money isn't earmarked for investments. It might not all go in the ground on a rapid fashion. There might be delayed payments that are paid over time. So that metric doesn't really impact the Blue Owl P&L. What we all focus on at the management company level is how much we've raised in total commitments per fund. And we've got about $4 billion left in Fund V. That's about a good annual pace for our deployment, and our pipeline looks really good. So it's going to mean that we're going to start talking to investors towards the middle to end of '23 about Fund VI. And the key question is when will we flip the switch and turn on fees for Fund VI, it's likely to be at some point in '24, depending on pacing of deployment for the rest of this year. Correct. That's correct. We wouldn't -- it's unlikely that we will have a one and done close for a big fund like that. It's not how we typically do it. Thanks, Chris."

            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Great. Thanks so much, Doug. Throughout the fourth quarter, Blue Owl continued to play an integral role as a liquidity provider to sponsors in a market where capital has been scarce. We continue to see attractive opportunities at wider spreads and lower loan to values than a year ago, financing large and high-quality companies. In 2022, gross originations and direct lending were $22 billion, just 7% below our 2021 originations despite a meaningful drop off in industry volume. We looked at nearly 70 deals with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion well exceeding the over 40 investments of that size we evaluated in 2021. In the fourth quarter, gross originations were $3.5 billion and net funded deployment was $2.5 billion, a moderate slowdown from our year-to-date pace that reflected timing considerations and slower repayments. We remain constructive about the deployment environment and continue to see a robust pipeline for investment. Though we don't anticipate origination volume to look like the second half of 2021 and the early months of 2022, until there's a broader recovery in M&A volumes. Credit quality always remains a key focus for us and we have been very stringent in our underwriting standards from day one, closing on approximately 5% of the deals we've evaluated since inception. We have been focused on the larger end of the direct lending market, financing companies that are key strategic players in their respective markets. In addition, we've largely stayed away from cyclical businesses in sectors that we view as carrying greater risk. We believe this selectivity has benefited the investors in our funds and our loan portfolio remains in very good shape. Since inception, we have originated over $73 billion of loans with annualized realized losses of less than 5 basis points. And inclusive of realized gains, we've actually had annualized net realized gains of 3 basis points. Our weighted average loan value remains in the low-40s across our direct lending portfolio and in the low-30s across our tech portfolio. We've continued to see resiliency in the portfolio with ongoing positive revenue and EBITDA growth at the underlying companies, despite the headwinds of inflation. Now turning to performance, the direct lending portfolio achieved gross appreciation of 3.6% for the fourth quarter and 9.4% for 2022, outperforming the Leverage Loan Index by approximately 9 points and the high yield index by over 20 points for the year. Now moving to real estate. We continue to see high levels of interest in our net lease strategy from investors and companies alike. With corporate borrowing costs elevated and financing markets choppier, the attractiveness of a net lease solution has resonated and our pipeline of opportunities remains robust with roughly $5.1 billion of transaction volume under a lot of intent or contract close and a near-term pipeline of about 24.5 billion of potential volume. Inclusive of announced acquisition activity, we've invested or committed nearly all of the equity in our fifth closed end fund. Persistently high inflation remains a focus for many investors driving demand for a net lease strategy with desirable inflation hedging characteristics as the CapEx, maintenance, taxes and other expenses of owning real estate are borne solely by the tenant. Our latest open-end product, Net Lease Trust, has reached $1 billion of capital raised primarily through just one large warehouse platform and we look forward to continuing to expand the syndicate over the coming quarters. And we on the first close on our sixth drawdown fund for our net lease strategy at approximately $2 billion and expect to wrap up fundraising sometime in the first half of 2023. We achieved gross appreciation across our real estate portfolio of 4% for the fourth quarter and 20.6% for 2022. We think these are noteworthy risk adjusted returns for the very strong underlying credit profile of these portfolios. Particularly given the downside protection presented by the contractual income streams and the long duration leases. In summary, we continue to see very strong demand from investors for our income generating downside protected strategies across our direct lending and real estate businesses and we continue to find attractive opportunities to put capital work. With that, let me turn to Michael to discuss GP Capital Solutions. Absolutely, Glenn. So it's a great question. First of all, I share your wishes. We wish we had more dry powder also in direct lending. It really is an exceptional time. 2022, the intersection of credit quality, most importantly, in a global world, as well as spreads, terms, sort of all the intersecting components is as good as we've ever seen. And reflects itself ultimately in the roll direct lending played in 2022 and continues to play. You take a look at the largest take private transactions all of the year, about half of them were done by direct lenders. And quite frankly of those half, we were a lead in almost every one of them. And we really think the opportunity is tremendous. We think about just looking over a year, year and a half between base rates and then some incremental spread one gets today on an incremental loan. You go from a world of making an 8% unlevered to making a 12% unlevered to take senior secured risk where and in fact many of these were software, which we particularly specialize and lead in, you know, you are talking about loan to values in the low 30s. So all the way of reinforcing what I think your observation about the market, it's a very attractive time for us to deploy capital. And I would say institutions get that. We are seeing a lot of interest from institutions. But because they see the risk return, being able to generate double-digit net returns to take extremely high in the cap stack risk in an uncertain world is pretty appealing. So we are seeing a lot of interest on the institutional side. And we continue to see a lot of interest on the retail side. As Alan said, bit of a mix shift, but in many regards, yes, there's some turbulence in the retail market, but more than anything that mix shift probably reflects the strength of institutional drive toward this asset class and you see people talking about it exactly as that as an asset class now. For many people, it wasn't even an asset class before. So we're very, very positive on the outlook for institutional involvement in this, again, asset class this year and beyond for that matter. More than happy to. Credit quality has always been and will be the central focus for the Blue Owl credit strategies, that's really what we live and breathe. Look, that matters a tremendous amount to us. We focus on it intensely. And tank fluid vanilla to deliver world-class results in it. I do want to say before I jump into the answers to your question, for a Blue Owl shareholder, it doesn't actually matter. Remember, you get paid fees, we have a feed-only business, and fee-only business from permanent capital. Now again, it matters a lot to us because this is what we live and breathe and how we deliver for our LPs. But I just want to remind us, depending on exactly where you sit -- and in this case as Blue Owl shareholder, it doesn't actually impact you. With that said, our credit quality remains very strong. We continue to see very strong portfolio performance. That is to say, if we look at revenue and EBITDA growth year-over-year, it continues to be very strong across the portfolio on average. We have not seen any material increase in amendment request. We have not seen a material increase in amendment request. We continue to monitor the portfolio, but it continues to perform on average very well. Look, of course, it's an uncertain environment. So I don't say that as if we're not sitting here spending every day thinking about what happens if what happens if, because that's indeed where we spend our time and where we should spend our time. But we are not seeing it in the underlying performance of the companies or the portfolio today. I think we only have three companies total on non-accrual across our very large platform. So I think we all continue to feel very good about the underwriting that got us here in the first place and the performance of the portfolio from there. And just to pull back up and cap it off on the numbers, look, if you look sitting here today, we've originated about $73 billion in loans since inception. And we continue, as we sit here, to run at an average annualized loss rate of less than 5 basis points. And in fact, when you take into account gains in those portfolios as well, we actually have a net realized gain of 3 basis points. So really continues to be our strength, and we'll continue to be vigilant, and we'll continue to plan for darker days, but we're in a good place as we head into that. Thank you. It's generally been steady. I mean, look, there's certainly variances quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, but no pattern narrow of note that we've observed recently. I would say statistic, we obviously pay a lot of attention to. I would say this, listen, we'd be perfectly happy if the mix of deals was so great, but the number was higher. Look, we're always going to do it, maybe days will be lower, maybe days will be higher. The key is to see a tremendous amount of investment opportunity and be extremely selective. And so whatever that lands to mathematically is more, of course, output than an input. And we continue to really like what we're seeing. There's no doubt that M&A volume, of course, when I said this earlier in my earlier comments, obviously, M&A volume is down. PE activity is down, and we're not going to defy that. And obviously, our originations therefore -- in Q4, originations as we enter this new year are lower than they were if you look at comparable times a year ago. So we don't live in a vacuum, but the quality of what we're seeing and the sort of selectivity we can still apply by having 100 people that spend every day out originating and looking at and underwriting and having built these relationships. We have credits that now we've known are in our system. They're likely to stay in our system even when those companies get sold. There's just -- there's a lot of forces at work that benefit us as an incumbent and someone that's proven to be a really reliable partner to so many great firms and great companies. So that's all kind of the context, I'd say, to selectivity. The -- what was the second part of the question? The banks. Yes, so listen, it's a big world out there, right? It's a multi-trillion-dollar credit market, and I know a lot of stories are about the banks versus the private lenders. It's a world that needs both. Now today, the private lenders and frankly, during COVID, proved to be the stabilizing force for the market. And this is an interesting change if we think about the arc of 20-years, which is today, the private lenders, ourselves and a couple of others of real scale, are the ones that are consistently available to commercial users. And the public markets come and go. So we actually stabilize the capital markets and the economy in a way that, frankly, the public markets used to. The banks play a role in syndication. Today, they obviously are sitting on many tens of billions of dollars of paper, they need to work through. So we do not see a meaningfully active syndicated market. It was really nearly nonexistent so to speak of in the fourth quarter. So this has been a time where we've certainly taking up a lot of that slack and therefore, share, but there'll be plenty of room for both in the world over time. And one thing I could add, it's far from a monolith, this idea of retail products or individual access points. There's a lot of difference in these products, even if by headline, they have the same names. Our products, which have been the Blue Owl brand, the Blue Owl place within the system, is all built around products that are about stability, predictability and very strong yields. Remember, in our credit products, we talked about the strength of the credit performance before, we've also been raising the distribution rates. I mean, how many products, how many asset classes in 2022 where people call in investors and saying, I want to let you know the returns are going to be better than you thought. I mean that's not a common threat. And even when we talk about real estate, definitely not a model if you remember, our real estate strategy is very, very different from what else is in the market. Triple-net lease, long-dated commitments from extremely high credit quality counterparties, where you take all of your expenses and costs and pass them through to the tenant. And you're not talking about trying to buy a building and re-lease it or hope it stays leased and deal with operating expenses and vacancies and therefore and hope for a better cap rate. None of that is part of our model. Our model is 15, 20-year leases on critical assets to critical clients. And our product, for example, pays a 7% yield with tax advantaged attributes for many investors. So it's just totally different even though it lives under the word real estate. So even within these categories, there are real differences that I think play to our strength, and we'll continue to develop new products, as Doug said, that hopefully continue that streak of delivering something different to our partner managers. Yes. With regard to deployment and credit, in particular, it's slower right now. As I said, we saw that in the fourth quarter. We see it now. We're not suggesting we have a crystal ball. But again, remember, with our permanent capital pools and with the variances, the deals we see, the investments we see, we really like. So our shortage, if anything, today, is really capital certainly not opportunity -- well, put another way, it's a shortage of capital against those opportunities. So the exact state of the M&A market in the second half, I don't really know. In terms of impact on P&L, frankly, that really only shows up in the, sort of, fees in the arrangement fees. So again, we don't predict that quarter-to-quarter. We're assuming a more tepid pace this year than we've seen in prior more robust years, and that's what our -- we're built on. With regard to inorganic, if you want a quick comment on that, look, we continue to be interested, but extremely selective in the idea of adding adjacent capabilities. When we add capabilities, there's things that are very much front of mind for us, which is, is it really a complementary product that suits our DNA and allows us to sort of deliver on the strengths of Blue Owl and across the platform? Is it a place where we can really deliver a market-leading role and performance? Clearly, in the spaces we're in, in GP Solutions, in triple net lease, we're the clear market leader in Direct Lending, one of a couple. And that's important to us that we'd be in products where we can really lead. We are not all things to all people. We want to be a handful of really good things to a wonderful side of investors. And then culture fit, critically important, take all that together, Oak Street is certainly a study in the kind of opportunity that we look for. We get a lot of inbounds, as you would expect, and we will continue to look. But that one, we can never predict when that will happen or won't happen, but we certainly continue to be active in the inorganic side as well."

            "name": "Doug Ostrover",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of growth for Blue Owl. Capping off our first full-year as a public company. Since Blue Owl's entrance to the public markets, we have grown our AUM by 122% and fee-paying AUM by 107%, anchored largely by permanent capital. And over the past year, we have achieved over 40% growth on the key metrics we use to evaluate our business, including management fees, FRE and DE, and have maintained an industry leading margin of 60%. This extraordinary growth has been driven by robust fundraising in capital deployment, despite a very challenging period in the markets. Let me provide some color on our achievements that drove this growth. We raised $25 billion of fee-paying AUM in 2022 bringing us halfway to our $50 billion fundraising goal for 2022 and 2023. Notably in the third quarter of 2022 alone, we raised more equity in that quarter than we had the entire year of 2021, reflecting robust demand and the expanding power of our increasingly global and integrated fundraising platforms across institutional and private wealth channels. Our strategies appeal to investors looking for positive leverage to rising interest rates, income generation with downside protection, inflation hedging and access to the positive secular trends across the alternative asset manager space. And we continue to see strong demand for these investment characteristics. Not only have we had strong fundraising trends, but our redemptions from products that offer quarterly tenders have remained de minimis with just $186 million of tenders received on the $13.4 billion of fee-paying AUM managed by those funds or less than 1.5%. By contrast, inflows into those same products were close to $1.6 billion during the quarter. Private wealth remains a successful market for Blue Owl with healthy flows, despite a more challenging market environment. A testament to the attractiveness of our products and the relationships we've built in the space. In direct lending, we had gross originations of $22 billion for the year, just slightly off our pace from the prior year, despite a 20% decline in U.S. leverage loan volumes and a 42% decline in announced U.S. M&A transactions. This speaks to the increasing breadth and scale of Blue Owl's platform, as well as the importance of direct lenders in today's marketplace. Volatility and uncertainty have created an environment where other market participants are unable or unwilling to lend capital, despite the very attractive opportunities present today and we are benefiting greatly from that dynamic. In GP Capital Solutions, we deployed about $4 billion of capital completing transactions with world class managers such as Dragonair, KPS, Veritas and PAI and bringing us to 70% committed for Fund V. During the fourth quarter, we held a final close for Fund V at nearly $13 billion over 40% higher than our $9 billion target during a period that many across the industry have described as a difficult fundraising environment. And in real estate, we are now fundraising for our net lease strategy across multiple product offerings and we are off to a great start. We closed approximately $2 billion for our drawdown product during the fourth quarter and are confident in reaching our fundraising target during the first half of 2023. In this current market environment, what we're seeing is that the safety, inflation hedging, and tax advantaged yield characteristics of this strategy have resonated with investors. And the cost of capital relative to the public markets has resonated with companies. We're very proud of the substantial asset growth Blue Owl has achieved over the short period of time, but our goal is not to be asset gatherers, not all AUM is created equal and our focus is on raising very long dated assets with attractive fee and margin characteristics, where we can provide a differentiated experience for our investors. That is how we look to drive meaningful earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders and we believe that should translate into substantial value over time. And we look to do so in a way that is predictable and resilient to a wide range of market conditions, which is why our permanent capital base and FRE-centric model are so important. Since our Investor Day in May, sell-side analyst's expectations for 2022 earnings growth across our peer group steadily declined as the street adjusted its view of carried interest and other difficult to predict earnings trends. In contrast, expectations for Blue Owl were unchanged. Speaking to our differentiated financial profile, and we delivered on what we said we would do. Achieving our goal of reaching $1.3 billion of revenue in 2022. For the year, Blue Owl generated FRE growth of 46% and DE growth of 42%, while maintaining an industry leading 60% FRE margin. This is especially notable given the market headwinds present throughout the year, which impacted the larger financial sector. We have nearly doubled our dividend over the last six quarters. And as Alan will highlight in greater detail later, we are now moving to a fixed dividend that we expect to grow meaningfully over time. Our asset base is very resilient. It's based on permanent capital, compared to our peers who must monetize assets with turn capital and raise a new fund and hopefully larger fund, we generally hold on to the assets we have. So each dollar of incremental assets raised is additive to our capital base. This is what we call the Layer Cake model. On top of that, we have over $10 billion of AUM that will start paying fees once the capital is deployed providing incremental visibility into our earnings growth ahead. This is what we call the embedded earnings power of our business. All of this should sound familiar to those of you who already know the Blue Owl story. Although the public equity and credit markets have been volatile, although interest rates have moved significantly this year and although inflation rose swiftly and has remained persistently high, weighing on GDP and many corporate earnings, the core goals that we outlined for you at Investor Day back in May have not changed. And for those that are just getting to know us, we think the past seven quarters as a public company have proven out the predictability, the stability, the resiliency and the growth potential of our business. Looking to 2023, we're excited about the runway we see ahead in spite of the challenging market environment. We continue to progress towards the financial goals we laid out for our shareholders at Investor Day. We are committed to providing strong performance, attractive income solutions and downside protected returns for our fund investors. We continue to deepen the relationships we have with our current institutional and wealth partners and build many new ones. And we continue to innovate to stay ahead of the competition and drive growth for our shareholders. The market backdrop has changed significantly since we've been public and continues to ship. But we think Blue Owl's business was purpose built for this type of market. And our value proposition increases during environments such as these. That's not to say that these are easy environments to navigate. To fund raise through or to deploy capital into, it is truly a testament to the incredible efforts of our employees the invaluable expertise we have across the firm and the benefits we're seeing from bringing these businesses together. Ultimately, the way I think about our business is this. We operate a capital light model focused on substantial capital return to shareholders, supported by a very stable and growing asset and fee base. Essentially an annuity with growth and in thinking about our earnings profile over the next few years, the question for us is not as it is for many companies, whether we're going to grow, it's how fast we'll grow. That is the value of permanent capital and management fee driven earnings. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc to give you an update on our direct lending and real estate businesses. Marc? Hey, Alex, just one comment. I just want to -- I think you know this, but just remind everybody look, we raised $25 billion last year and what I would describe as a really challenging and choppy market. We're not saying it's going to be easy, but as we go through and take a look at what we have in the market and do a demand assessment, both retail and institutionally, we feel pretty good about hitting that number. But I think you know this assets are clearly really important to us, but our ultimate focus is on earnings. And Alan mentioned this, we feel very good about hitting that $1 billion of DE in \u201823. Thank you. Thanks, Glenn. Sure. Thanks, Patrick. So look, we really weren't that surprised to see wealth flows slow down during '22. The markets were incredibly volatile. And I -- when we got into this seven, eight years ago, we never thought it was going to be a straight line up to the right. And I can tell you, as an institution, we're still really excited about the opportunity. We still believe that over time, I can't tell you the exact amount of time, but over time, trillions of dollars are going to go from the wealth channel into the alternative space. And I think we are uniquely positioned to capture more than our fair share of that money flowing in. I think Alan commented during his comments, across our platform in the fourth quarter, we had $2.2 billion of inflows from the wealth channel, and we only had $186 million of redemptions. Let me say that one more time, $2.2 billion of inflows, $186 million of redemptions. We think that's pretty good. And as you think about the markets going forward, if they were to remain choppy or volatile, it's probably a good starting point for us. No guarantees, but I think what we've done is a couple of things. One, with the market pulling back, it's given everybody a chance to just catch their breath. And so we have been out, we've met with all the wire houses, RIAs, other distributors, spending a lot of time on education, and I think that's helped minimize redemptions. But we've also gotten a sense of what are the products they think they want to bring later this year, early next year? And I can tell you that, two things I feel pretty good about. One, over the next 12, maximum 18 months, you will see us introduce into the wealth space, a number of differentiated products. And two, and I can't give you exact numbers and timing, you will see us significantly increase the syndicate for our products that are currently in the market. So net-net, we are still unbelievably bullish, and we're pleased with how we're performing in this difficult market. All right. That's a lot for me to try to hit. So in terms of new products, unfortunately, we'll announce them as we roll them out. In terms of risk appetite at the firms, they really want new, interesting, differentiated type of strategies. And the reason the firms, the gatekeepers want it because that's what the end customers want. They want things that will allow them to allow the wire houses, in particular, to differentiate themselves with their client bases. So they have been very receptive. Now we haven't rolled any of these out. But I think, hopefully, in the next quarter or two, we'll announce at least one and maybe two that we'll be working on. In terms of the risk appetite, the retail investor, it's too early to say with the market up year-to-date. Our flows are still decent, but we haven't seen a big uptick or downtick. But I -- my guess would be, if the market stays robust, we will see risk appetite increase and you should expect flows to increase with the market going up. But really hard to predict the mindset. But I just want to go back to what I said earlier. We're unbelievably bullish about the opportunity. I know there's this focus on quarter-over-quarter, but we're thinking year-over-year. And I will tell you as we go out and we talk to those gatekeepers in particular and some of the largest advisers, they are all very focused on all. So I think we're in the right place. We're well situated, and as I said earlier, I would anticipate we continue to get more than our fair share in the space. Good morning. Well, thanks, everybody. We appreciate all the questions. We're clearly proud of our results for '22. You've heard us in the past talk describe our business using the words I think Marc touched on the stability, profitability and growth. And just to highlight the growth again, revenue, FRE, DE, AUM, all up well over 40% year-over-year. And I think you've got a sense on this call, we're equally as excited about 2023. And we're reaffirming that $1 billion of DE. So appreciate all the support, and look forward to talking to everyone soon. Thank you."

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We'd also like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website at blueowl.com. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any interest in a Blue Owl fund. This morning, we issued our financial results for the third quarter of 2022, and reported Fee-Related Earnings, or FRE, of $0.15 per share, and distributable earnings, or DE, of $0.14 per share. We also declared a dividend of $0.12 per share payable on November 30 to shareholders of record as of November 21. During the call today, we'll be referring to the earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning. So, please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of growth for Blue Owl. And as I reflect on the growing earnings power of our firm, and contrast that to how our stock has traded over the last few months, I'm really struck by the disparity between these two trends. So, I thought it would be an interesting moment in time to pull the lens back in the midst of this market dislocation and volatility, and really focus on what we have accomplished as a business. We entered the public markets in May of 2021 at $10 per share. At that time, we mapped out and shared with our investors an ambitious growth plan. And over the past six quarters, we have been making substantial progress in outperforming that plan. As you can see on Slide 6, since our entrance to the public markets, we have grown AUM by 112%, fee-paying AUM by 96%, and permanent capital by 86%. We have also grown management fees by 93%, distributable earnings by 77%, and our dividend by 50%. We acquired a $15 billion net lease real estate business, and a $6.5 billion CLO business, and we have continued to expand our already robust retail distribution.  Our earnings are driven 100% with FRE, with 93% of our management fees coming from permanent capital. And over the past few weeks, we have traded below our $10 per share initial trading price, despite an earning stream that looks like a quickly growing and highly durable annuity stream. We can't control the market. All we can do at the end of the day is continue to put up strong results like we did again this quarter. We have made good progress towards the key milestones we highlighted in our Investor Day, raising 50 billion of fee-paying AUM across 2022 and 2023, achieving after-tax DE of $1 billion in 2023, and paying $1 per share dividend in 2025. Across the firm, we have a unique perspective on market dynamics, considering the over 300 portfolio companies we work within our direct lending business, our over 50 partner managers in GP Solutions, and the over 100 companies we work with in real estate. The operating trends we see remain positive and durable across this cohort, despite the elevated volatility in public markets. Portfolio company revenue continues to trend positively, with an ability to pass along impacts of inflation for the most part, which supports the bottom line, and therefore, each company's ability to service its debt. Our partner managers, who tend to be larger, more diversified, and more specialized alternative asset managers, continue to fundraise successfully, meeting their stated capital-raising targets. And in real estate, we continue to see 100% rent payment across our tenants. And ultimately, we believe that as we continue to prove out Blue Owl's resilient business model, that will resonate with public investors through what we expect to be a continued challenging and volatile market backdrop. Moving on to our third quarter results. We demonstrated another quarter of steady and robust growth, with management fees growing 19% quarter-over-quarter and 70% year-over-year. We had a record fundraising quarter, well diversified across institutional and private wealth channels, with $8.8 billion of new capital raised across the platform. The last 12 months, we have raised over $37 billion across new capital and debt, which is nearly three times greater than the prior 12-month period, and we continue to broaden our distribution footprint, as we integrate and cross sell institutionally, and expand our private wealth distribution efforts globally. We had a very robust quarter of institutional fundraising, with significant capital raised across diversified and tech lending and GP minority equity stakes. Institutional accounts constituted roughly 60% of capital raised in the third quarter, including commitments from new and existing LPs across the US, Europe, and Asia, and we have raised $12.7 billion from institutional accounts over the last 12 months. In aggregate, over the past year and a half, we have raised nearly $8 billion from institutional LPs that were non-investors prior to our introduction to the public markets, illustrating the ongoing demand for our strategies, and continued progress in expanding our LP base. And private wealth had another strong quarter of fundraising, with $3.6 billion of inflows for the third quarter, bringing the last 12-month inflows to over $11 billion. Tender requests have remained de minimis, with approximately $75 million across our entire platform. What we hear often from our fund investors is that the defensive nature of our strategies, and their focus on income generation, principal preservation, and inflation protection, are highly desirable during good markets, but they stand out even more during challenging environments. Our fundraising during the third quarter reflects the ongoing demand for these qualities, and for the track record we have generated in our strategies.  Looking ahead, the key messages that we've highlighted over the past year, and most recently at Investor Day, should continue to resonate in today's market. The market backdrop may have changed, but we have not wavered in our long-term strategic focus in the slightest. And in fact, we think this market environment favors Blue Owl's business. We see meaningful runway to raise capital across institutional and wealth channels, and in our view, we have the right strategies, the right people, and deep investment expertise in place to invest that capital well. Permanent capital remains the cornerstone of our business, creating competitive advantages and supporting growth. And with each successive dollar of new assets raised, we will continue to add new layers to Blue Owl\u2019s earnings power.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc to give you an update on our direct lending and real estate businesses. Marc.\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thanks so much, Doug. The favorable investing environment in direct lending we highlighted last quarter, remained in place through the third quarter, as Blue Owl played an integral role as liquidity provider to sponsors in a market where capital has been scarce, with lenders unwilling or unable to commit to financings. We continue to see very attractive opportunities at wider spreads and lower loan to values to even larger and higher quality companies than we've seen for some time, and remain very selective in our underwriting standards. And the healthy fundraising trends we have seen, position our firm well to lead some of the biggest and most compelling deals happening in the market today, such as Anaplan, Zendesk, and Avalara. So, just to expound on this a bit further, about the attractiveness of the opportunities we're evaluating today, let me contrast what we're seeing right now to a typical deal from even a year ago. On the base rate, we're about 250 basis points higher as a result of Fed actions, and on an average deal, we might be seeing spreads about 100 to 150 basis points wider than a year ago. So, combined with a stronger position to negotiate even better terms, we're looking at investments that could provide 11 to 12% unlevered yields relative to approximately 7% to 8% unlevered for a similar financing a year ago. And generally, we're also seeing sponsors put in more equity for deals today, create an even greater cushion for us as the creditor. In addition, we continue to finance very large market-leading companies, and year-to-date, have looked at approximately 60 deals with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion, exceeding the over 40 investments of that size we evaluated in all of 2021 for the full year. And we continue to see a good pipeline, despite the decline in broader industry M&A volumes. So, you can see on Slide 13 of the earnings presentation, we had gross originations of $6 billion, and net funded deployment of $3.9 billion for the third quarter, driving the ongoing growth of our high-quality portfolio, and by extension, management fees. For the last 12 months, gross originations in direct lending have been $26.1 billion, or 33% greater than what we originated in the prior 12-month period. Credit quality across our direct lending portfolio remained very strong, with our annualized realized losses remaining at approximately five basis points since inception, but even that overstates losses as we also had realized gains. In fact, we've had annualized realized net gains of positive five basis points. That is to say, if we take our realized losses with our realized gains together, that is a net positive for investors. Our weighted average loan to value remains in the low 40s across our direct lending portfolio, and in the low 30s across our tech portfolio. We've continued to see great resiliency in the ability of the portfolio companies we finance to pass along cost increases to their end customers, limiting the impact to their margins. So, turning to performance, the direct lending portfolio achieved gross appreciation of 5.4% for the third quarter, and 8.1% over the last 12 months.  Now, turning to real estate, we continue to see very high levels of interest in our net lease strategy, and myriad opportunities to put capital to work. As corporate borrowing costs continue to increase, and markets become harder to access, the attractiveness of a net lease solution grows, and we continue to see a robust pipeline of opportunities, with roughly $6.9 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent, or contract to close, and a near-term pipeline of more than $21 billion of potential volume. Inclusive of announced acquisition activity, we've invested or committed over 80% of the equity in our fifth closed end fund, keeping us on track to hold an initial close of our real estate Fund VI this quarter. We launched our latest open-end product, Net Lease Trust in September, through one of the large wirehouses, and we are in the process of expanding the syndicate over the coming quarters.  In the current environment of persistently high inflation, a net lease strategy offers desirable inflation-hedging characteristics, as the CapEx, maintenance taxes, and other expenses of owning real estate, are borne solely by the tenant, and investors\u2019 response to the structure as a result, has been very positive. We're very excited about our net lease strategy generally, and believe we've got a very differentiated approach. Investors in this strategy are able to access the advantages of the net lease structure, which targets an attractive 7% plus yield for primarily investment grade counterparties, with beneficial tax attributes, and we think this compares quite favorably to other strategies currently out there. You've heard us say this multiple times, but I think it bears repeating. Income generation, inflation mitigation, and downside protection, are what fund investors are looking for in markets such as these, and our net lease strategy provides exactly that. We achieved gross appreciation across our real estate portfolio of 2.8% for the third quarter, and 22.9% for the last 12 months. These are strong risk-adjusted returns for the underlying credit profile of these portfolios, and they seem to be resonating well with the investors we speak to.  So, with that, let me turn it to Michael to discuss the GP Capital Solutions business.\nMichael Rees: Thank you, Marc. We continue to see constructive trends in our GP Capital Solutions business. Given our scale, we are focused on the largest, most diversified managers within the alternatives universe. These managers remain the beneficiaries of a persistent trend of GP consolidation, with the big getting bigger, and the strong getting stronger. We held what we had expected to be our final close for Dyal V towards the end of the quarter, and at that time, agreed with our fund investors, to allow a final $500 million of capacity to come in before year-end. With the existing and closed $12.5 billion, and the anticipated incremental $500 million, we expect the final fund size for Dyal V to reach approximately $13 billion, relative to our initial $9 billion goal. This was a very successful fundraise, and was characterized by a growing and diversified LP base, with over 250 investors, many of whom were new to Blue Owl products. From the Fund V fundraise, $6.9 billion was from institutional LPs, of which over half are new firm relationships. $5.3 billion was from the wealth and intermediary channels, approximately two thirds of which are from platforms and intermediary partners that are new firm relationships. The attractiveness of such a large number of new clients, highlights the opportunity Blue Owl has to continue to cross sell and collaboratively cover additional clients across each of our three leading investment strategies. Clearly, we've been seeing strong and growing demand for our differentiated GP minority equity stakes strategy, highlighting what we believe to be a market-leading position. Fund V is a record fundraise in the GP stakes industry, at over twice the size of the next largest competitor. We've raised approximately two thirds of all the capital allocated to GP stakes funds over the last decade. This puts us in a position to continue deploying capital into large firms with the leading track records, who we believe will continue to outperform other market players over the long run. Total invested commitments for Dyal V, net of co-investments to our investors, and including agreements in principle to close on two additional investments, will bring Fund V to $8.4 billion of capital that has been committed to investments, and we continue to see a relatively smooth deployment pace, with roughly $4 billion of equity committed annually for the last few years, despite large changes in economic and market conditions. The investments we make through our GP minority equity stake strategy, are the culmination of many years of relationship-building and strategic conversations, making the timing of capital deployment less dependent on short-term dynamics. We remain confident in this relatively smooth deployment pace as we look ahead. Performance across Dyal Funds remain strong, with a net IRR of 23.4% for Fund III, and 57.6% for our Fund IV. We're very optimistic about what the next 12 months hold for the GP Capital Solutions business. Not only is Dyal well positioned within a very small subset of firms that have the scale and capability to provide growth capital to these fund managers, but we continue to partner with managers who are the greatest beneficiaries of flows to alternatives and GP consolidation. Overall, we see ample opportunities to take advantage of the dislocation in the current market environment.  With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation, so please feel free to have that available to follow along. To start off, this earnings call is going to sound a lot like my remarks from last quarter and the quarter before, and I suspect next quarter will sound a lot like my remarks from this quarter. We built our business with a foundation of permanent capital and steady predictable management fee cash flows. We don't have lumpy vol of carried interest revenues going through our P&L, so we look different than our peers. And we have expected that earnings releases last quarter, this quarter, and next quarter, will continue to differentiate us in the diversified alt industry. Okay, let's cover our quarterly results. Our third quarter was another quarter of strong growth for our business. Management fees are up $54.9 million or 19% from last quarter, and up 70% from the third quarter a year ago. Broken down by strategy, direct lending management fees are up $24 million or 16% from last quarter, and up 50% from the third quarter a year ago. GP Capital Solutions management fees are up $29.1 million, or 23% from last quarter, and up 72% from the third quarter a year ago, and real estate management fees are up $1.8 million, or 10% from last quarter. So, as you can see, we had double-digit management fee growth quarter-over-quarter sequentially in all three of our strategies. FRE is up $12.8 million or 6% from last quarter, and up 48% from the third quarter a year ago. Distribution costs are driving the lower increase in FRE quarter-over-quarter, which also brought FRE margins down a little from last quarter, all in line with the guidance we provided on our last earnings call in August. We continue to be right on track with our 60% FRE margin guidance for 2022, but I'll cover that more in a few moments. Our ratio of compensation as a percentage of revenue is roughly flat to last quarter at 27%. And we announced a dividend of $0.12 per share for the third quarter, up from $0.11 per share last quarter, and $0.09 per share in the third quarter a year ago, resulting in a 33% increase in our dividend year-over-year. All of this is in line with our expectations and what we noted on our earnings call last quarter.  Now, I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts as we posted very large numbers again in the third quarter. As a reminder, in the second quarter we raised $7.2 billion, and now in the third quarter, we have raised $8.8 billion. I'll break down these numbers across our strategies and products. In direct lending, we raised $5.5 billion, over $2 billion from one of the three biggest state pensions in the US, a new relationship for us, $1.7 billion for our tech strategy, $0.8 billion for our retail distributed core income BDC, ORCIC, which has now over $5.25 billion of equity, and approximately $1 billion for other direct lending products. In GP Capital Solutions, we raised $2.9 billion. $2.7 billion was raised for Dyal Fund V, and then an additional $200 million of co-invest. That brings our total funds raised for Dyal Fund V to $12.5 billion through September 30. When you think about a run rate revenue number for the GP Capital Solutions strategy overall, I would think of that as around $525 million to $540 million annualized, which includes all commitments raised through September 30. Not included in these fundraising or run rate revenue numbers, we have the ability to raise an additional up to $500 million through the end of this year in Dyal Fund V.  In real estate, we raised $400 million, a good early outcome for the recently launched Net Lease Trust product, our first non-trad REIT, which is leveraging our best-in-class retail distribution network. That momentum continues to build nicely into the fourth quarter, and we are also planning for an initial close of our real estate Fund VI product in the fourth quarter, which we are all very excited about. As you just heard, we have had extraordinarily strong second and third quarter fundraising levels, and we have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We are not expecting the same record levels in the fourth quarter as we saw in the second and third quarters, but we are expecting another strong fundraising quarter.  As it relates to our AUM metrics, on Slide 11, we reported AUM of $132.1 billion, fee-paying AUM of $84.1 billion, and total permanent capital of $106 billion. AUM not yet paying fees was $10.7 billion as of September 30. AUM grew $13 billion to $132.1 billion, an 11% increase from last quarter, and an 87% increase from the third quarter a year ago. Fee-paying AUM grew $6.6 billion to 84.1 billion, a 9% increase from last quarter, and a 79% increase from the third quarter a year ago, those metrics driven primarily by capital raise and deployment in direct lending, capital raised in Dyal Fund V, and when looking at the growth from a year ago, the addition of our real estate and CLO businesses. Permanent capital grew $10.5 billion to $106 billion, an 11% increase from last quarter, and a 64% increase from the third quarter a year ago, driven primarily by capital raise and deployment in direct lending, capital raised in Dyal Fund V, as well as the addition of our real estate business when compared to a year ago. AUM not yet paying fees was $10.7 billion, including $9 billion in direct lending, $0.8 billion in GP Capital Solutions, and $0.9 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling approximately $140 million once deployed. As Marc highlighted earlier, we continue to have strong deployment in direct lending, with gross originations of $6 billion for the quarter, and net funded deployment of $3.9 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $26.1 billion, with $16.9 billion of net funded deployment. So, as it relates to the $9 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us about two quarters to fully deploy this, based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on Slide 22, we currently have over $1 billion of liquidity, with an average 13-year maturity, and low 2.9% cost of borrowing.  So, to wrap up here before getting to Q&A, there are a few last items I want to cover. For G&A and distribution costs, on previous earnings calls, I've been talking about larger distribution costs coming in the back half of this year. In the third quarter, we incurred approximately $37 million of distribution costs. Most of this was anticipated, and I had provided guidance on this last quarter during our Q&A session, but some of it, approximately $8 million was due to the much larger final closing of Dyal Fund V. The $37 million of distribution costs this quarter, compares to approximately $12 million of distribution costs that were incurred in the second quarter. As I have mentioned on previous calls, these are incredibly valuable dollars we're raising here, permanent capital that would generate significant management fees, and Part I fees every quarter, every year for our shareholders. As we look to the fourth quarter of this year, we think we could incur approximately $25 million of distribution costs, but as I've said on previous earnings calls, it's sometimes hard to predict the size and timing of these costs. Also, for the third quarter, our regular wage G&A, excluding distribution costs, is slightly down from the second quarter, although I do expect this line item to continue to grow in future quarters, simply as a result of the overall continued growth of our business. As it relates to the financial milestones we've put out guidance on, we are on track with all of them, but here's a more specific update. We are right on track to achieve $1.3 billion of revenues this year. We are right on track to achieve a 60% FRE margin this year. We are right on track to raise $50 billion of fee-paying AUM during 2022 and 2023. Of the $50 billion, we have raised approximately $20 billion through September 30. This amount represents year-to-date equity raised, plus year-to-date debt raised for products where we earn fees on debt, less year-to-date fee-free capital. We are on track to double our 2021 revenues of $900 million to $1.8 billion in 2023. We are on track to achieve $1 billion of distributable earnings in 2023. We are on track to achieve a $1 per share dividend in 2025. When I think about our dividends for 2022, we have posted a $0.10 dividend for the first quarter, an $0.11 dividend for the second quarter, a $0.12 dividend for this quarter, and we feel comfortable we can post a $0.13 dividend for the fourth quarter. Since we had set a target at the beginning of this year of distributing approximately 85% of DE, this has given us the ability to hold some cash back for buying back our stock, funding GP commits to our new products, and investing in the growth of our business. We continue to plan to fix our dividend for 2023, which I will talk more about in February on our fourth quarter earnings call. As I think about all the items I just ran through, I see them as a very strong message about our business model. In these times of market dislocation, volatility, and overall strong headwinds, we continue to demonstrate strong growth quarter-over-quarter, quarter after quarter, and remain on track with all of the milestones we had set for ourselves. Speaking of buying back shares, we have been active buying back our stock this year, in particular over the past few months. Since the beginning of the third quarter, we have bought back $4.3 million shares at an average price of $9.26 per share, for a total of approximately $40 million, incredible value for our shareholders. That brings our year-to-date buyback totals to $6.3 million shares at an average price of $10.17 cents per share, or approximately $65 million. I have commented on these past few earnings calls about the rising rate environment we're in, and the potential impact that could have on our business. We have included here again on Slide 14, the impact of rising rates to our direct lending business. As expected, and in line with our previous guidance, we saw a significant increase in our Part I fees from last quarter. In the third quarter, included in our management fee line, our Part I fees from our BDCs, increased 1$6.1 million or 35% from the second quarter. A large portion of this was driven by higher interest rates, and some of it was from AUM growth in our newer BDCs, like ORCIC and ORTF II. We are expecting to see an additional increase in our management fee line in the fourth quarter due to continued rising rates, and could see possible increases into next year. So, summing it all up, we are very pleased with our results again this quarter, delivering strong growth quarter-over-quarter in all of our key metrics, AUM, fee-paying AUM, permanent capital, management fees, FRE, and DE. Heading into year end, we are very excited about how our first full year as a public company will wrap up, and we can't wait to report those results to you in February.  Thank you again to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that, operator, will you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey guys, good morning. I think that was me. Sorry, I thought - it wasn't particularly clear. So, thanks for the update. I think the question that I have for you guys is around the $50 billion fundraising target that you've reiterated through 2023. I mean, clearly, the retail environment has gotten a bit softer for the whole industry, given all the volatility and we've seen sort of moderation in flows across the space. So, if we continue to be in a fairly uncertain macro backdrop, can you help us sort of fill the gaps of where the incremental fundraising is going to come from if retail falls short of your original expectations to get you to the 50 billion? \nDoug Ostrover: Sure. Good morning and thanks for the question, Alex. So, yes, we are reiterating the $50 billion. We came out with that on our Investor Day in May. I think Alan mentioned we've raised $20 billion to date, and we'll go into this further on. We're expecting a good fourth quarter. You know we had a great third quarter. We raised almost $9 billion, and that breaks out 60% institutional, 40% retail. We don't spend a lot of time on institutional, but if you remember, when we put all these businesses together, we spend a lot of time talking about, we have no overlap in our LP basis, and that opportunity to cross sell is just beginning. And I think what you're seeing is, we are just starting to capitalize on that opportunity. I don't want to overstate it. It takes time, but it's something we're very positive on. In terms of wealth, we raised $3.6 billion for the quarter. I think that is basically in line with what we did in the second quarter, and I think it's important to point out we had virtually no redemptions or de minimis redemptions in the second and third quarter. I also want to comment, with regard to wealth, I know we all want the flows to be very consistent and every quarter up to the right, but you know better than anyone, that's just not how markets work. But I think if you peel the onion back and you think about the products we have, we think they are far superior than what a high-net-worth investor could find in a mutual fund or anywhere in the public markets. We touched on this. High current income that's downside-protected. So, I can't tell you exactly what the wealth flows will be quarter-over-quarter, but I can tell you that over the next five years, we believe strongly we're going to see a significant amount of wealth capital flow into the alternative markets. And we're confident, and I think we've proved over the last number of years, that we're in a position to capture a meaningful amount of those flows.\nAlex Blostein: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. So, I have a question on GP stakes, and in this environment, I would think the pipeline opportunity is big because there's no other ways to access, except for someone like you. So, A, if you could talk about the pipeline, and, B, if you could talk about - the inception to date on Dyal - on Fund IV is great, but it is down low to mid double digits quarter-on-quarter. Expected in this market, but I'm curious on how you go about it. Meaning, is it a company-specific market? There\u2019s a higher discount rate. They\u2019re using public comps. I'm just curious on how the marks work there. Thank you. \nMichael Rees: Hey Glenn, it's Michael. Thanks for the questions. We saw your Beastie Boys reference in the other note. Was hoping we'd get a Guns and Roses reference this time, but maybe next time. The pipeline in GP Solutions is one that's built over many, many years. So, most of the deals we're doing are the result of five to seven to 10 years\u2019 worth of conversations, and they really aren't specific to a market environment quarter-over-quarter. So, our pipeline is extremely consistent. We target and have achieved about $4 billion of deployments per year, and that's a consistent number when you look back several years. So, we're going to do several deals in the last two quarters of this year, with really great GPs, and it's not market timing on their part or ours. So, I would just expect a very consistent deployment pace out of GP Solutions, 2022, 2023, and \u201824. So, it's not - like I said, it\u2019s not overly market environment specific. Fund IV is doing great. If you do want to look at very specific things that drove the price and fund performance this quarter, there are several stocks, public companies that are held in in Fund IV. Those include Blue Owl as a result of the original Owl Rock investment, as well as Bridgepoint. And so, when you look at the actual quarter-on-quarter change, it was really driven predominantly by those two names that had mark-to-market losses over the quarter from a share price perspective. We sort of hesitate early in a fund's life to put out those IRRs because the lack of a J curve in the early cash flows mean that we're going to have really high IRRs at the outset, and they will probably - as deployment of the fund continues, they'll probably moderate. I wouldn't look at a super high IRR going to a high IRR being any reflection of that fund's performance. We expect it to be a great cash flow generator for our fund investors over time. We don't even report Fund V\u2019s IRR yet because it's so eye-popping, and it will most likely only modulate down as capital goes in the ground. But once we get to years five, six, seven of a fund like we are with Fund III, you'll see a much more consistent IRR, mid-20s for that fund that will be pretty hard to budge just given how much time has progressed and how much cash flow is coming out of the Dyal GP stakes funds.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay, thanks very much. Hope you avoid the November rain.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well and good to hear that the - you're on track with your targets.\nDoug Ostrover: Thanks, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So, my question is on the credit quality migration within direct lending. And from the last disclosures, it looks like ORCIC still had zero non-accruals, but across all your direct lending portfolios, what are you seeing on the credit quality front? Has there been any pickup in non-accruals? Have you needed to restructure a higher number of loans? Any early-stage delinquencies, compensation of paying kind, anything on that front would be helpful, just given that it looks like we\u2019re in a recession.\nMarc Lipschultz: Of course. Thank you. So, a few thoughts. Let me headline with which I know we talk about each quarter, the credit performance is bedrock for us. It's really, really important and we do thankfully a really good job with it. But for purposes of Owl shareholders, remember, the credit performance doesn't actually matter. This is a fee-based earning business. All of our revenues come from fees. So, for the shareholders here, actually managing the capital is what matters. Obviously, performance matters over the long-term for raising capital. With that said, because we are intensely focused on this issue of credit and returns, the straightforward answer, and I know where this question comes from, it's a very logical question in a tumultuous world, credit quality is strong. At the end of the day, we continue to see very good performance in our portfolio. That is to say, we continue to see - Craig talked about this yesterday on the ORCC call, growth revenue and EBITDA quarter-over-quarter in the portfolio, we continue to see great strength in the sectors we've picked. We do 10 tour sectors that are what many people would characterize as very defensive. And so, look, we're definitely entering tumultuous times. And of course, there has to be a mathematical certainty that in a recession, somehow that puts more strain on businesses on the margin than a booming environment. But we continue to see very consistent performance, very strong interest coverage. You asked a very good question about some of the early measures that we sometimes will see if there is even more challenge coming. Right now, our ratings, and as you know, we publicly rate all of our portfolio companies in the BDCs, have remained categorically quite stable, what\u2019s in one, two, and three and below. But the early indicators sometimes would be things like accelerating requests for amendments, or accelerating requests for incremental capital. Whereas you point out, picking interest, and we're not seeing any of that. Actually, pace on those types of requests has been very steady. So, we're not ignoring the clouds on the horizon money measure. We always plan for them. We have planned for them in building the portfolio. So, the best I can deduce is, by virtue of having planned this way and built our portfolio always for durability through a cycle like this, we're seeing the benefits. And as a result, for - since inception, as you know, we've done $60 billion in loans and our loss rate has been - realized loss rate has been five basis points when you take into effect as we - as I commented before, actual realized gains, losses net of gains actually is a positive number in our portfolio across the platform since inception. So, we're keeping a close eye. We recognize how tumultuous the environment is, but we are seeing continued very strong performance. \nCraig Siegenthaler: That's great to hear. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nBill Katz: Okay, thank you very much taking the questions. Good morning. Maybe going to try and sneak a two-part question, so I apologize for violating the code. First part of the question is, can you give us a sense of, as you think about - I know you just did Fund V, but can you help us walk through the timing on Fund VI, just given what you talk about in terms of deployment. So, we\u2019re staying on a $4 billion glide path. And was there anything in the third quarter in terms of catch-up fees? And then the second question is, as you look out into 2023, how should we be thinking about operating leverage?\nMichael Rees: Thanks, Bill. Michael here. On Fund VI, when you look at the $8.4 billion of Fund V that is committed and earmarked to deals, and we look at our pipeline, and as I alluded to, the steady $4 billion or so of annualized commitments and deployments, it puts us in a position to really get out on the road and start talking to clients at the very end of next year. And we expect 2024 to be the year where we turn on the fees in Fund VI. So, no real change to that overall plan. We were successful in raising a bigger fund this time around than we had thought, but puts us really squarely in place to start fees at some point in 2024. And we'll give more guidance as we get there. Catch-up fees were $21 million. The way that we think about it, most of our clients opt to pay a higher forward-looking management fee as opposed to catch-up fees. And so, we're seeing increases in overall management fee rates and relatively small catch-up fees at $21 million this quarter, given the amount of capital being raised. So, we'd prefer ongoing steady higher management fees, and that's what our clients have been selecting as well. \nDoug Ostrover: And Alan, could you have something else?\nAnn Dai: Bill, could you repeat your second part of the question? I believe it was operating leverage.\nBill Katz: Thank you, and thank you for taking the second question. So, just, you think through moving past some of the noise in terms of the catch-up fee and the sort of upfront placement fees, which I appreciate the transitory nature of that. As we sort of think about the core operating leverage of the franchise, obviously running at a pretty high 60% to begin with, does that all incrementally drops to the bottom line, or would you look to potentially reinvest some of that to spur even faster growth looking beyond 24?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Bill. So, generally - it\u2019s Alan. Generally speaking, I think we should continue to target 60% as our FRE margin for our business. It\u2019s, as you noted, already industry high. And when you blend that across all of our different strategies and businesses, I think that's a pretty comfortable place to land.\nBill Katz: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. If I caught this correctly, I think that you called out that you were going to continue to fix the dividend in 2023. I guess, what are the considerations that you're thinking about when you set this level? And the fact that you called this out just sort of caught my attention. Has something changed in terms of how you're thinking about the dividend in the future?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Ken. Appreciate the question. So, going back to our Investor Day in May, I talked about our expectation to fix the dividend in 2023 and on a go-forward basis. We think that has the potential to open up our shareholder base to investors that aren't otherwise looking at a company who has a variable dividend philosophy. And so, that is something that we've been focused on. Obviously, the things that we think about and consider when we consider setting a fixed dividend is really what is our DE going to look like for next year? What do we want to hold back this year? As I've mentioned on the call and on previous calls, we had been targeting 85% as a variable payout on DE. We're right in line with that for this year. We have to think about how much we want to hold back for things like stock buybacks, GP commits, and the like, in order to set that fixed dividend. So, there'll be a lot more to come in February when we come out and announce the level of where we're going to fix it.\nMarc Lipschultz: But I think embedded in your question maybe, is it any change in the directional payout approach, the idea that we pay out the bulk of our earnings? I think to be clear, it's not. This is - as Alan just said, we've talked before about the 85% payout target. That remains the underpinning math. We\u2019ve just got to do the math and convert that, so to speak, into a fixed dividend. So, I don't want to overread the question, but if it's, are we changing the philosophy around building balance sheet versus paying out? We are a balance sheet-light, pay out our earnings, rising dividend stock model, but fixed dividend step functions perhaps instead of variable every quarter, which is what Al is referring to. \nAlan Kirshenbaum: Agreed. Well said.\nKen Worthington: Okay, perfect. I want to make sure I wasn't overreading your comments, so thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: Oh, thank you. And good morning. I want to ask about a trend or potential trend in the wealth management channel. One of the things that we're hearing is that among some of the larger distributors and some of their FAs, there's an increasing appetite for exclusive products, i.e., products or strategies that are distinct and only available at certain firms. So, I just wanted to get your thoughts. Is that something that Blue Owl is considering or would consider? And more broadly, what do you consider the pros and cons of that approach? Thank you.\nDoug Ostrover: Well, thanks for the question. That - we are not seeing that. There's definitely a preference to launch a product first on your platform and have a period of exclusivity. But remember what most firms, big wirehouse is one, they don't want to have their clients be 100% of the capital. It's important to them that there's other capital raised away from them. So, I don't - that's not a trend that we are seeing, but I do agree with you. We are focused, and I think they're focused on working with firms that can bring differentiated product. If you think about what we have in the market right now, we have our diversified lending called core income that looks a lot like other funds, and there's quite a few people competing in that space. We have our tech lending product where we are the only firm in the market with a tech product. We have our triple net lease. It's real estate, but it's a much different wrinkle on real estate, and we're getting really good traction on that. And I think it's fair to say over the next few quarters, you'll see us introduce other products where we have virtually no competition in the wealth channel. And look, what we're always striving for, and we've said this numerous times today, is bring products where we can protect the downside and give investors a meaningful current income and potentially nice capital gains. And so, we're working on a number of products in conjunction with those wirehouses, and I think over the next couple of quarters, we'll have more to say on that.\nAdam Beatty: Great. Appreciate the nuance. Thank you, Doug.\nOperator: [Operator instructions]. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe to stay on that retail theme, can you remind us of the wirehouses - I know you were onboarding one or two in the third and I think fourth quarters. Just remind us of the penetration you have in the wirehouses now, or at least (indiscernible). And when you think about the penetration within those wirehouses in terms of the financial advisors using your product, what sort of is the opportunity to build that? And if you don't mind commenting on how you're thinking about the RAA market as well and private banks. So, trying - basically trying to get an understanding of the runway of distribution penetration that could offset or more than offset any kind of sort of risk off type of pullback by retail investors.\nDoug Ostrover: Yes. Thanks for the question. It's a good question. I kind of have to break it out by product. As I think about our diversified lending strategy, our core income, we've built a pretty sizable syndicate there. I should start by saying, we're working with all of the major wirehouses, but we don't have all of our products in those wirehouses. So, in diversified lending, with core income, we're pretty well penetrated, but we have a ways to go. In the technology fund, we're on a couple of wirehouses today, but we still think there's a lot of growth there. And then we're really excited about our non-traded REIT, the Oak Street REIT. We're only in one wirehouse, and I think in the first quarter, you'll see us build out a pretty meaningful syndicate. In terms of the RIAs, we have a team of about 12 people covering that marketplace, and we are actively pushing all three of those strategies right now, and having a lot of success. One thing I do want to comment about the wirehouse is, if you take a step back, you just think about bringing these products, you get on, you don't generate massive sales right away. It takes time. Remember, we're out - we're calling on all the big producers, and then the next layer and the layer beneath that of financial advisors. So, we have to educate them. We have to get them comfortable with the product. We've had great success, but as you think about where we are, I would tell you, we are in the very early innings of what we think we can achieve. Our penetration is nowhere near as high as a firm, let's say, like Blackstone. And I think we can get close to what they've achieved. It's just going to take us a little bit of time.\nMarc Lipschultz: Maybe just add one element of color to that, if I could, which is, because you talked about penetration within the wirehouses, which Doug just made reference to, this still is a very thin slice of the individual investor universe. There's a so-called power user. There's a set of kind of FAs and clients that are well understand, are getting the significant benefits of access to these products. But the vast preponderance of individual investors within these platforms have yet to even use the product, and in many cases, probably don't even have familiarity with the product. So, it's a very big white space. And sure, when people are more of a risk off environment, more of a risk off attitude, it'll be - it takes longer for people to adopt and per person orders might be a bit lower here and there, but also, wealth is not a monolithic thing, right? At the end of the day, it all gets down to your particular products, your particular clients, and your particular penetration. And fortunately for us, that's working in our favor. We're not seeing redemptions. We are seeing adoption of products that are truly distinctive, like Doug talked about, like our triple net lease product and our tech product. So, we are seeing that, and we're seeing a lot of new platforms that we're just not on with many of these products. So, this continues to be an area of significant opportunity. Again, in this environment, we're not trying to pretend we know what will happen month to month, but I think we're feeling very good about the direction this takes us.\nBrian Bedell: That's great color. Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Sumeet Mody with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nSumeet Mody: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. On the inorganic front, just maybe wanted to get an update on the conversations you're having with any M&A targets, and maybe what are the adjacent solutions you're finding the most compelling today maybe across real estate, new geographies outside the US, things like that.\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. Well, look, our business and the plans you've all seen are predicated on what we know to be very strong, visible, predictable growth, which again, I think is the most distinctive feature probably of our model, and you're seeing it this quarter and you're going to continue to see it. As Alan said in his comments, we have the regular rhythm. We can see that steady growth organically, and that's all we can count on, so to speak, and of course, what we can control. However, certainly, we're going to continue to be active in the world of evaluating M&A opportunities. There was a good question earlier about what's happening in the marketplace? Look, there is no IPO market for all these firms, and access to capital to the degree people want it for either their own growth purposes or people want to be part of a platform with the scale benefits of being part of something like Blue Owl, this is a pretty interesting environment. So, we're going to continue to be certainly actively engaged, selective. You've heard us say this many times. We're not trying to be all things to all people. We want to be extremely good at the things we do, and we want them all to be adjacent in this ecosystem of providing capital solutions to this broader private market universe. So, all of that will continue to guide us. But listen, if we can find another Oak Street, I mean, there's a spectacular platform and a spectacular set of funds which we think are going to thrive particularly in this environment, but in any environment, if we can find that or some interesting tactical opportunities like a wealth fleet, you'll certainly see us continue to do so.\nOperator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to CEO, Doug Ostrover, for closing remarks.\nDoug Ostrover: Well, thanks, Operator, and thank you, everyone, for the questions. We do appreciate it. I just want to say, look, we're really pleased with our third quarter results, and we're hopeful that all of you take away that we've built a pretty unique firm with a very steady stream of income from permanent capital. And you tie that with meaningful growth, we think we have a stock that is poised to do quite well. I'll just add, we're grateful for everyone's support. We remain confident in where the firm is heading, and we look forward to hopefully continuing to exceed investors\u2019 expectations. So, thanks again.\nOperator: And this will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation, so please feel free to have that available to follow along. To start off, this earnings call is going to sound a lot like my remarks from last quarter and the quarter before, and I suspect next quarter will sound a lot like my remarks from this quarter. We built our business with a foundation of permanent capital and steady predictable management fee cash flows. We don't have lumpy vol of carried interest revenues going through our P&L, so we look different than our peers. And we have expected that earnings releases last quarter, this quarter, and next quarter, will continue to differentiate us in the diversified alt industry. Okay, let's cover our quarterly results. Our third quarter was another quarter of strong growth for our business. Management fees are up $54.9 million or 19% from last quarter, and up 70% from the third quarter a year ago. Broken down by strategy, direct lending management fees are up $24 million or 16% from last quarter, and up 50% from the third quarter a year ago. GP Capital Solutions management fees are up $29.1 million, or 23% from last quarter, and up 72% from the third quarter a year ago, and real estate management fees are up $1.8 million, or 10% from last quarter. So, as you can see, we had double-digit management fee growth quarter-over-quarter sequentially in all three of our strategies. FRE is up $12.8 million or 6% from last quarter, and up 48% from the third quarter a year ago. Distribution costs are driving the lower increase in FRE quarter-over-quarter, which also brought FRE margins down a little from last quarter, all in line with the guidance we provided on our last earnings call in August. We continue to be right on track with our 60% FRE margin guidance for 2022, but I'll cover that more in a few moments. Our ratio of compensation as a percentage of revenue is roughly flat to last quarter at 27%. And we announced a dividend of $0.12 per share for the third quarter, up from $0.11 per share last quarter, and $0.09 per share in the third quarter a year ago, resulting in a 33% increase in our dividend year-over-year. All of this is in line with our expectations and what we noted on our earnings call last quarter.  Now, I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts as we posted very large numbers again in the third quarter. As a reminder, in the second quarter we raised $7.2 billion, and now in the third quarter, we have raised $8.8 billion. I'll break down these numbers across our strategies and products. In direct lending, we raised $5.5 billion, over $2 billion from one of the three biggest state pensions in the US, a new relationship for us, $1.7 billion for our tech strategy, $0.8 billion for our retail distributed core income BDC, ORCIC, which has now over $5.25 billion of equity, and approximately $1 billion for other direct lending products. In GP Capital Solutions, we raised $2.9 billion. $2.7 billion was raised for Dyal Fund V, and then an additional $200 million of co-invest. That brings our total funds raised for Dyal Fund V to $12.5 billion through September 30. When you think about a run rate revenue number for the GP Capital Solutions strategy overall, I would think of that as around $525 million to $540 million annualized, which includes all commitments raised through September 30. Not included in these fundraising or run rate revenue numbers, we have the ability to raise an additional up to $500 million through the end of this year in Dyal Fund V.  In real estate, we raised $400 million, a good early outcome for the recently launched Net Lease Trust product, our first non-trad REIT, which is leveraging our best-in-class retail distribution network. That momentum continues to build nicely into the fourth quarter, and we are also planning for an initial close of our real estate Fund VI product in the fourth quarter, which we are all very excited about. As you just heard, we have had extraordinarily strong second and third quarter fundraising levels, and we have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We are not expecting the same record levels in the fourth quarter as we saw in the second and third quarters, but we are expecting another strong fundraising quarter.  As it relates to our AUM metrics, on Slide 11, we reported AUM of $132.1 billion, fee-paying AUM of $84.1 billion, and total permanent capital of $106 billion. AUM not yet paying fees was $10.7 billion as of September 30. AUM grew $13 billion to $132.1 billion, an 11% increase from last quarter, and an 87% increase from the third quarter a year ago. Fee-paying AUM grew $6.6 billion to 84.1 billion, a 9% increase from last quarter, and a 79% increase from the third quarter a year ago, those metrics driven primarily by capital raise and deployment in direct lending, capital raised in Dyal Fund V, and when looking at the growth from a year ago, the addition of our real estate and CLO businesses. Permanent capital grew $10.5 billion to $106 billion, an 11% increase from last quarter, and a 64% increase from the third quarter a year ago, driven primarily by capital raise and deployment in direct lending, capital raised in Dyal Fund V, as well as the addition of our real estate business when compared to a year ago. AUM not yet paying fees was $10.7 billion, including $9 billion in direct lending, $0.8 billion in GP Capital Solutions, and $0.9 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling approximately $140 million once deployed. As Marc highlighted earlier, we continue to have strong deployment in direct lending, with gross originations of $6 billion for the quarter, and net funded deployment of $3.9 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $26.1 billion, with $16.9 billion of net funded deployment. So, as it relates to the $9 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us about two quarters to fully deploy this, based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on Slide 22, we currently have over $1 billion of liquidity, with an average 13-year maturity, and low 2.9% cost of borrowing.  So, to wrap up here before getting to Q&A, there are a few last items I want to cover. For G&A and distribution costs, on previous earnings calls, I've been talking about larger distribution costs coming in the back half of this year. In the third quarter, we incurred approximately $37 million of distribution costs. Most of this was anticipated, and I had provided guidance on this last quarter during our Q&A session, but some of it, approximately $8 million was due to the much larger final closing of Dyal Fund V. The $37 million of distribution costs this quarter, compares to approximately $12 million of distribution costs that were incurred in the second quarter. As I have mentioned on previous calls, these are incredibly valuable dollars we're raising here, permanent capital that would generate significant management fees, and Part I fees every quarter, every year for our shareholders. As we look to the fourth quarter of this year, we think we could incur approximately $25 million of distribution costs, but as I've said on previous earnings calls, it's sometimes hard to predict the size and timing of these costs. Also, for the third quarter, our regular wage G&A, excluding distribution costs, is slightly down from the second quarter, although I do expect this line item to continue to grow in future quarters, simply as a result of the overall continued growth of our business. As it relates to the financial milestones we've put out guidance on, we are on track with all of them, but here's a more specific update. We are right on track to achieve $1.3 billion of revenues this year. We are right on track to achieve a 60% FRE margin this year. We are right on track to raise $50 billion of fee-paying AUM during 2022 and 2023. Of the $50 billion, we have raised approximately $20 billion through September 30. This amount represents year-to-date equity raised, plus year-to-date debt raised for products where we earn fees on debt, less year-to-date fee-free capital. We are on track to double our 2021 revenues of $900 million to $1.8 billion in 2023. We are on track to achieve $1 billion of distributable earnings in 2023. We are on track to achieve a $1 per share dividend in 2025. When I think about our dividends for 2022, we have posted a $0.10 dividend for the first quarter, an $0.11 dividend for the second quarter, a $0.12 dividend for this quarter, and we feel comfortable we can post a $0.13 dividend for the fourth quarter. Since we had set a target at the beginning of this year of distributing approximately 85% of DE, this has given us the ability to hold some cash back for buying back our stock, funding GP commits to our new products, and investing in the growth of our business. We continue to plan to fix our dividend for 2023, which I will talk more about in February on our fourth quarter earnings call. As I think about all the items I just ran through, I see them as a very strong message about our business model. In these times of market dislocation, volatility, and overall strong headwinds, we continue to demonstrate strong growth quarter-over-quarter, quarter after quarter, and remain on track with all of the milestones we had set for ourselves. Speaking of buying back shares, we have been active buying back our stock this year, in particular over the past few months. Since the beginning of the third quarter, we have bought back $4.3 million shares at an average price of $9.26 per share, for a total of approximately $40 million, incredible value for our shareholders. That brings our year-to-date buyback totals to $6.3 million shares at an average price of $10.17 cents per share, or approximately $65 million. I have commented on these past few earnings calls about the rising rate environment we're in, and the potential impact that could have on our business. We have included here again on Slide 14, the impact of rising rates to our direct lending business. As expected, and in line with our previous guidance, we saw a significant increase in our Part I fees from last quarter. In the third quarter, included in our management fee line, our Part I fees from our BDCs, increased 1$6.1 million or 35% from the second quarter. A large portion of this was driven by higher interest rates, and some of it was from AUM growth in our newer BDCs, like ORCIC and ORTF II. We are expecting to see an additional increase in our management fee line in the fourth quarter due to continued rising rates, and could see possible increases into next year. So, summing it all up, we are very pleased with our results again this quarter, delivering strong growth quarter-over-quarter in all of our key metrics, AUM, fee-paying AUM, permanent capital, management fees, FRE, and DE. Heading into year end, we are very excited about how our first full year as a public company will wrap up, and we can't wait to report those results to you in February.  Thank you again to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that, operator, will you please open the line for questions? Thanks, Bill. So, generally - it's Alan. Generally speaking, I think we should continue to target 60% as our FRE margin for our business. It's, as you noted, already industry high. And when you blend that across all of our different strategies and businesses, I think that's a pretty comfortable place to land. Thanks, Ken. Appreciate the question. So, going back to our Investor Day in May, I talked about our expectation to fix the dividend in 2023 and on a go-forward basis. We think that has the potential to open up our shareholder base to investors that aren't otherwise looking at a company who has a variable dividend philosophy. And so, that is something that we've been focused on. Obviously, the things that we think about and consider when we consider setting a fixed dividend is really what is our DE going to look like for next year? What do we want to hold back this year? As I've mentioned on the call and on previous calls, we had been targeting 85% as a variable payout on DE. We're right in line with that for this year. We have to think about how much we want to hold back for things like stock buybacks, GP commits, and the like, in order to set that fixed dividend. So, there'll be a lot more to come in February when we come out and announce the level of where we're going to fix it. Agreed. Well said."

            "content": "Thank you, Marc. We continue to see constructive trends in our GP Capital Solutions business. Given our scale, we are focused on the largest, most diversified managers within the alternatives universe. These managers remain the beneficiaries of a persistent trend of GP consolidation, with the big getting bigger, and the strong getting stronger. We held what we had expected to be our final close for Dyal V towards the end of the quarter, and at that time, agreed with our fund investors, to allow a final $500 million of capacity to come in before year-end. With the existing and closed $12.5 billion, and the anticipated incremental $500 million, we expect the final fund size for Dyal V to reach approximately $13 billion, relative to our initial $9 billion goal. This was a very successful fundraise, and was characterized by a growing and diversified LP base, with over 250 investors, many of whom were new to Blue Owl products. From the Fund V fundraise, $6.9 billion was from institutional LPs, of which over half are new firm relationships. $5.3 billion was from the wealth and intermediary channels, approximately two thirds of which are from platforms and intermediary partners that are new firm relationships. The attractiveness of such a large number of new clients, highlights the opportunity Blue Owl has to continue to cross sell and collaboratively cover additional clients across each of our three leading investment strategies. Clearly, we've been seeing strong and growing demand for our differentiated GP minority equity stakes strategy, highlighting what we believe to be a market-leading position. Fund V is a record fundraise in the GP stakes industry, at over twice the size of the next largest competitor. We've raised approximately two thirds of all the capital allocated to GP stakes funds over the last decade. This puts us in a position to continue deploying capital into large firms with the leading track records, who we believe will continue to outperform other market players over the long run. Total invested commitments for Dyal V, net of co-investments to our investors, and including agreements in principle to close on two additional investments, will bring Fund V to $8.4 billion of capital that has been committed to investments, and we continue to see a relatively smooth deployment pace, with roughly $4 billion of equity committed annually for the last few years, despite large changes in economic and market conditions. The investments we make through our GP minority equity stake strategy, are the culmination of many years of relationship-building and strategic conversations, making the timing of capital deployment less dependent on short-term dynamics. We remain confident in this relatively smooth deployment pace as we look ahead. Performance across Dyal Funds remain strong, with a net IRR of 23.4% for Fund III, and 57.6% for our Fund IV. We're very optimistic about what the next 12 months hold for the GP Capital Solutions business. Not only is Dyal well positioned within a very small subset of firms that have the scale and capability to provide growth capital to these fund managers, but we continue to partner with managers who are the greatest beneficiaries of flows to alternatives and GP consolidation. Overall, we see ample opportunities to take advantage of the dislocation in the current market environment.  With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results. Hey Glenn, it's Michael. Thanks for the questions. We saw your Beastie Boys reference in the other note. Was hoping we'd get a Guns and Roses reference this time, but maybe next time. The pipeline in GP Solutions is one that's built over many, many years. So, most of the deals we're doing are the result of five to seven to 10 years' worth of conversations, and they really aren't specific to a market environment quarter-over-quarter. So, our pipeline is extremely consistent. We target and have achieved about $4 billion of deployments per year, and that's a consistent number when you look back several years. So, we're going to do several deals in the last two quarters of this year, with really great GPs, and it's not market timing on their part or ours. So, I would just expect a very consistent deployment pace out of GP Solutions, 2022, 2023, and \u201824. So, it's not - like I said, it's not overly market environment specific. Fund IV is doing great. If you do want to look at very specific things that drove the price and fund performance this quarter, there are several stocks, public companies that are held in in Fund IV. Those include Blue Owl as a result of the original Owl Rock investment, as well as Bridgepoint. And so, when you look at the actual quarter-on-quarter change, it was really driven predominantly by those two names that had mark-to-market losses over the quarter from a share price perspective. We sort of hesitate early in a fund's life to put out those IRRs because the lack of a J curve in the early cash flows mean that we're going to have really high IRRs at the outset, and they will probably - as deployment of the fund continues, they'll probably moderate. I wouldn't look at a super high IRR going to a high IRR being any reflection of that fund's performance. We expect it to be a great cash flow generator for our fund investors over time. We don't even report Fund V's IRR yet because it's so eye-popping, and it will most likely only modulate down as capital goes in the ground. But once we get to years five, six, seven of a fund like we are with Fund III, you'll see a much more consistent IRR, mid-20s for that fund that will be pretty hard to budge just given how much time has progressed and how much cash flow is coming out of the Dyal GP stakes funds. Thanks, Bill. Michael here. On Fund VI, when you look at the $8.4 billion of Fund V that is committed and earmarked to deals, and we look at our pipeline, and as I alluded to, the steady $4 billion or so of annualized commitments and deployments, it puts us in a position to really get out on the road and start talking to clients at the very end of next year. And we expect 2024 to be the year where we turn on the fees in Fund VI. So, no real change to that overall plan. We were successful in raising a bigger fund this time around than we had thought, but puts us really squarely in place to start fees at some point in 2024. And we'll give more guidance as we get there. Catch-up fees were $21 million. The way that we think about it, most of our clients opt to pay a higher forward-looking management fee as opposed to catch-up fees. And so, we're seeing increases in overall management fee rates and relatively small catch-up fees at $21 million this quarter, given the amount of capital being raised. So, we'd prefer ongoing steady higher management fees, and that's what our clients have been selecting as well."

            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Great. Thanks so much, Doug. The favorable investing environment in direct lending we highlighted last quarter, remained in place through the third quarter, as Blue Owl played an integral role as liquidity provider to sponsors in a market where capital has been scarce, with lenders unwilling or unable to commit to financings. We continue to see very attractive opportunities at wider spreads and lower loan to values to even larger and higher quality companies than we've seen for some time, and remain very selective in our underwriting standards. And the healthy fundraising trends we have seen, position our firm well to lead some of the biggest and most compelling deals happening in the market today, such as Anaplan, Zendesk, and Avalara. So, just to expound on this a bit further, about the attractiveness of the opportunities we're evaluating today, let me contrast what we're seeing right now to a typical deal from even a year ago. On the base rate, we're about 250 basis points higher as a result of Fed actions, and on an average deal, we might be seeing spreads about 100 to 150 basis points wider than a year ago. So, combined with a stronger position to negotiate even better terms, we're looking at investments that could provide 11 to 12% unlevered yields relative to approximately 7% to 8% unlevered for a similar financing a year ago. And generally, we're also seeing sponsors put in more equity for deals today, create an even greater cushion for us as the creditor. In addition, we continue to finance very large market-leading companies, and year-to-date, have looked at approximately 60 deals with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion, exceeding the over 40 investments of that size we evaluated in all of 2021 for the full year. And we continue to see a good pipeline, despite the decline in broader industry M&A volumes. So, you can see on Slide 13 of the earnings presentation, we had gross originations of $6 billion, and net funded deployment of $3.9 billion for the third quarter, driving the ongoing growth of our high-quality portfolio, and by extension, management fees. For the last 12 months, gross originations in direct lending have been $26.1 billion, or 33% greater than what we originated in the prior 12-month period. Credit quality across our direct lending portfolio remained very strong, with our annualized realized losses remaining at approximately five basis points since inception, but even that overstates losses as we also had realized gains. In fact, we've had annualized realized net gains of positive five basis points. That is to say, if we take our realized losses with our realized gains together, that is a net positive for investors. Our weighted average loan to value remains in the low 40s across our direct lending portfolio, and in the low 30s across our tech portfolio. We've continued to see great resiliency in the ability of the portfolio companies we finance to pass along cost increases to their end customers, limiting the impact to their margins. So, turning to performance, the direct lending portfolio achieved gross appreciation of 5.4% for the third quarter, and 8.1% over the last 12 months.  Now, turning to real estate, we continue to see very high levels of interest in our net lease strategy, and myriad opportunities to put capital to work. As corporate borrowing costs continue to increase, and markets become harder to access, the attractiveness of a net lease solution grows, and we continue to see a robust pipeline of opportunities, with roughly $6.9 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent, or contract to close, and a near-term pipeline of more than $21 billion of potential volume. Inclusive of announced acquisition activity, we've invested or committed over 80% of the equity in our fifth closed end fund, keeping us on track to hold an initial close of our real estate Fund VI this quarter. We launched our latest open-end product, Net Lease Trust in September, through one of the large wirehouses, and we are in the process of expanding the syndicate over the coming quarters.  In the current environment of persistently high inflation, a net lease strategy offers desirable inflation-hedging characteristics, as the CapEx, maintenance taxes, and other expenses of owning real estate, are borne solely by the tenant, and investors' response to the structure as a result, has been very positive. We're very excited about our net lease strategy generally, and believe we've got a very differentiated approach. Investors in this strategy are able to access the advantages of the net lease structure, which targets an attractive 7% plus yield for primarily investment grade counterparties, with beneficial tax attributes, and we think this compares quite favorably to other strategies currently out there. You've heard us say this multiple times, but I think it bears repeating. Income generation, inflation mitigation, and downside protection, are what fund investors are looking for in markets such as these, and our net lease strategy provides exactly that. We achieved gross appreciation across our real estate portfolio of 2.8% for the third quarter, and 22.9% for the last 12 months. These are strong risk-adjusted returns for the underlying credit profile of these portfolios, and they seem to be resonating well with the investors we speak to.  So, with that, let me turn it to Michael to discuss the GP Capital Solutions business. Of course. Thank you. So, a few thoughts. Let me headline with which I know we talk about each quarter, the credit performance is bedrock for us. It's really, really important and we do thankfully a really good job with it. But for purposes of Owl shareholders, remember, the credit performance doesn't actually matter. This is a fee-based earning business. All of our revenues come from fees. So, for the shareholders here, actually managing the capital is what matters. Obviously, performance matters over the long-term for raising capital. With that said, because we are intensely focused on this issue of credit and returns, the straightforward answer, and I know where this question comes from, it's a very logical question in a tumultuous world, credit quality is strong. At the end of the day, we continue to see very good performance in our portfolio. That is to say, we continue to see - Craig talked about this yesterday on the ORCC call, growth revenue and EBITDA quarter-over-quarter in the portfolio, we continue to see great strength in the sectors we've picked. We do 10 tour sectors that are what many people would characterize as very defensive. And so, look, we're definitely entering tumultuous times. And of course, there has to be a mathematical certainty that in a recession, somehow that puts more strain on businesses on the margin than a booming environment. But we continue to see very consistent performance, very strong interest coverage. You asked a very good question about some of the early measures that we sometimes will see if there is even more challenge coming. Right now, our ratings, and as you know, we publicly rate all of our portfolio companies in the BDCs, have remained categorically quite stable, what's in one, two, and three and below. But the early indicators sometimes would be things like accelerating requests for amendments, or accelerating requests for incremental capital. Whereas you point out, picking interest, and we're not seeing any of that. Actually, pace on those types of requests has been very steady. So, we're not ignoring the clouds on the horizon money measure. We always plan for them. We have planned for them in building the portfolio. So, the best I can deduce is, by virtue of having planned this way and built our portfolio always for durability through a cycle like this, we're seeing the benefits. And as a result, for - since inception, as you know, we've done $60 billion in loans and our loss rate has been - realized loss rate has been five basis points when you take into effect as we - as I commented before, actual realized gains, losses net of gains actually is a positive number in our portfolio across the platform since inception. So, we're keeping a close eye. We recognize how tumultuous the environment is, but we are seeing continued very strong performance. But I think embedded in your question maybe, is it any change in the directional payout approach, the idea that we pay out the bulk of our earnings? I think to be clear, it's not. This is - as Alan just said, we've talked before about the 85% payout target. That remains the underpinning math. We've just got to do the math and convert that, so to speak, into a fixed dividend. So, I don't want to overread the question, but if it's, are we changing the philosophy around building balance sheet versus paying out? We are a balance sheet-light, pay out our earnings, rising dividend stock model, but fixed dividend step functions perhaps instead of variable every quarter, which is what Al is referring to. Maybe just add one element of color to that, if I could, which is, because you talked about penetration within the wirehouses, which Doug just made reference to, this still is a very thin slice of the individual investor universe. There's a so-called power user. There's a set of kind of FAs and clients that are well understand, are getting the significant benefits of access to these products. But the vast preponderance of individual investors within these platforms have yet to even use the product, and in many cases, probably don't even have familiarity with the product. So, it's a very big white space. And sure, when people are more of a risk off environment, more of a risk off attitude, it'll be - it takes longer for people to adopt and per person orders might be a bit lower here and there, but also, wealth is not a monolithic thing, right? At the end of the day, it all gets down to your particular products, your particular clients, and your particular penetration. And fortunately for us, that's working in our favor. We're not seeing redemptions. We are seeing adoption of products that are truly distinctive, like Doug talked about, like our triple net lease product and our tech product. So, we are seeing that, and we're seeing a lot of new platforms that we're just not on with many of these products. So, this continues to be an area of significant opportunity. Again, in this environment, we're not trying to pretend we know what will happen month to month, but I think we're feeling very good about the direction this takes us. Sure. Well, look, our business and the plans you've all seen are predicated on what we know to be very strong, visible, predictable growth, which again, I think is the most distinctive feature probably of our model, and you're seeing it this quarter and you're going to continue to see it. As Alan said in his comments, we have the regular rhythm. We can see that steady growth organically, and that's all we can count on, so to speak, and of course, what we can control. However, certainly, we're going to continue to be active in the world of evaluating M&A opportunities. There was a good question earlier about what's happening in the marketplace? Look, there is no IPO market for all these firms, and access to capital to the degree people want it for either their own growth purposes or people want to be part of a platform with the scale benefits of being part of something like Blue Owl, this is a pretty interesting environment. So, we're going to continue to be certainly actively engaged, selective. You've heard us say this many times. We're not trying to be all things to all people. We want to be extremely good at the things we do, and we want them all to be adjacent in this ecosystem of providing capital solutions to this broader private market universe. So, all of that will continue to guide us. But listen, if we can find another Oak Street, I mean, there's a spectacular platform and a spectacular set of funds which we think are going to thrive particularly in this environment, but in any environment, if we can find that or some interesting tactical opportunities like a wealth fleet, you'll certainly see us continue to do so."

            "name": "Doug Ostrover",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of growth for Blue Owl. And as I reflect on the growing earnings power of our firm, and contrast that to how our stock has traded over the last few months, I'm really struck by the disparity between these two trends. So, I thought it would be an interesting moment in time to pull the lens back in the midst of this market dislocation and volatility, and really focus on what we have accomplished as a business. We entered the public markets in May of 2021 at $10 per share. At that time, we mapped out and shared with our investors an ambitious growth plan. And over the past six quarters, we have been making substantial progress in outperforming that plan. As you can see on Slide 6, since our entrance to the public markets, we have grown AUM by 112%, fee-paying AUM by 96%, and permanent capital by 86%. We have also grown management fees by 93%, distributable earnings by 77%, and our dividend by 50%. We acquired a $15 billion net lease real estate business, and a $6.5 billion CLO business, and we have continued to expand our already robust retail distribution.  Our earnings are driven 100% with FRE, with 93% of our management fees coming from permanent capital. And over the past few weeks, we have traded below our $10 per share initial trading price, despite an earning stream that looks like a quickly growing and highly durable annuity stream. We can't control the market. All we can do at the end of the day is continue to put up strong results like we did again this quarter. We have made good progress towards the key milestones we highlighted in our Investor Day, raising 50 billion of fee-paying AUM across 2022 and 2023, achieving after-tax DE of $1 billion in 2023, and paying $1 per share dividend in 2025. Across the firm, we have a unique perspective on market dynamics, considering the over 300 portfolio companies we work within our direct lending business, our over 50 partner managers in GP Solutions, and the over 100 companies we work with in real estate. The operating trends we see remain positive and durable across this cohort, despite the elevated volatility in public markets. Portfolio company revenue continues to trend positively, with an ability to pass along impacts of inflation for the most part, which supports the bottom line, and therefore, each company's ability to service its debt. Our partner managers, who tend to be larger, more diversified, and more specialized alternative asset managers, continue to fundraise successfully, meeting their stated capital-raising targets. And in real estate, we continue to see 100% rent payment across our tenants. And ultimately, we believe that as we continue to prove out Blue Owl's resilient business model, that will resonate with public investors through what we expect to be a continued challenging and volatile market backdrop. Moving on to our third quarter results. We demonstrated another quarter of steady and robust growth, with management fees growing 19% quarter-over-quarter and 70% year-over-year. We had a record fundraising quarter, well diversified across institutional and private wealth channels, with $8.8 billion of new capital raised across the platform. The last 12 months, we have raised over $37 billion across new capital and debt, which is nearly three times greater than the prior 12-month period, and we continue to broaden our distribution footprint, as we integrate and cross sell institutionally, and expand our private wealth distribution efforts globally. We had a very robust quarter of institutional fundraising, with significant capital raised across diversified and tech lending and GP minority equity stakes. Institutional accounts constituted roughly 60% of capital raised in the third quarter, including commitments from new and existing LPs across the US, Europe, and Asia, and we have raised $12.7 billion from institutional accounts over the last 12 months. In aggregate, over the past year and a half, we have raised nearly $8 billion from institutional LPs that were non-investors prior to our introduction to the public markets, illustrating the ongoing demand for our strategies, and continued progress in expanding our LP base. And private wealth had another strong quarter of fundraising, with $3.6 billion of inflows for the third quarter, bringing the last 12-month inflows to over $11 billion. Tender requests have remained de minimis, with approximately $75 million across our entire platform. What we hear often from our fund investors is that the defensive nature of our strategies, and their focus on income generation, principal preservation, and inflation protection, are highly desirable during good markets, but they stand out even more during challenging environments. Our fundraising during the third quarter reflects the ongoing demand for these qualities, and for the track record we have generated in our strategies.  Looking ahead, the key messages that we've highlighted over the past year, and most recently at Investor Day, should continue to resonate in today's market. The market backdrop may have changed, but we have not wavered in our long-term strategic focus in the slightest. And in fact, we think this market environment favors Blue Owl's business. We see meaningful runway to raise capital across institutional and wealth channels, and in our view, we have the right strategies, the right people, and deep investment expertise in place to invest that capital well. Permanent capital remains the cornerstone of our business, creating competitive advantages and supporting growth. And with each successive dollar of new assets raised, we will continue to add new layers to Blue Owl's earnings power.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc to give you an update on our direct lending and real estate businesses. Marc. Sure. Good morning and thanks for the question, Alex. So, yes, we are reiterating the $50 billion. We came out with that on our Investor Day in May. I think Alan mentioned we've raised $20 billion to date, and we'll go into this further on. We're expecting a good fourth quarter. You know we had a great third quarter. We raised almost $9 billion, and that breaks out 60% institutional, 40% retail. We don't spend a lot of time on institutional, but if you remember, when we put all these businesses together, we spend a lot of time talking about, we have no overlap in our LP basis, and that opportunity to cross sell is just beginning. And I think what you're seeing is, we are just starting to capitalize on that opportunity. I don't want to overstate it. It takes time, but it's something we're very positive on. In terms of wealth, we raised $3.6 billion for the quarter. I think that is basically in line with what we did in the second quarter, and I think it's important to point out we had virtually no redemptions or de minimis redemptions in the second and third quarter. I also want to comment, with regard to wealth, I know we all want the flows to be very consistent and every quarter up to the right, but you know better than anyone, that's just not how markets work. But I think if you peel the onion back and you think about the products we have, we think they are far superior than what a high-net-worth investor could find in a mutual fund or anywhere in the public markets. We touched on this. High current income that's downside-protected. So, I can't tell you exactly what the wealth flows will be quarter-over-quarter, but I can tell you that over the next five years, we believe strongly we're going to see a significant amount of wealth capital flow into the alternative markets. And we're confident, and I think we've proved over the last number of years, that we're in a position to capture a meaningful amount of those flows. Thanks, Craig. And Alan, could you have something else? Well, thanks for the question. That - we are not seeing that. There's definitely a preference to launch a product first on your platform and have a period of exclusivity. But remember what most firms, big wirehouse is one, they don't want to have their clients be 100% of the capital. It's important to them that there's other capital raised away from them. So, I don't - that's not a trend that we are seeing, but I do agree with you. We are focused, and I think they're focused on working with firms that can bring differentiated product. If you think about what we have in the market right now, we have our diversified lending called core income that looks a lot like other funds, and there's quite a few people competing in that space. We have our tech lending product where we are the only firm in the market with a tech product. We have our triple net lease. It's real estate, but it's a much different wrinkle on real estate, and we're getting really good traction on that. And I think it's fair to say over the next few quarters, you'll see us introduce other products where we have virtually no competition in the wealth channel. And look, what we're always striving for, and we've said this numerous times today, is bring products where we can protect the downside and give investors a meaningful current income and potentially nice capital gains. And so, we're working on a number of products in conjunction with those wirehouses, and I think over the next couple of quarters, we'll have more to say on that. Yes. Thanks for the question. It's a good question. I kind of have to break it out by product. As I think about our diversified lending strategy, our core income, we've built a pretty sizable syndicate there. I should start by saying, we're working with all of the major wirehouses, but we don't have all of our products in those wirehouses. So, in diversified lending, with core income, we're pretty well penetrated, but we have a ways to go. In the technology fund, we're on a couple of wirehouses today, but we still think there's a lot of growth there. And then we're really excited about our non-traded REIT, the Oak Street REIT. We're only in one wirehouse, and I think in the first quarter, you'll see us build out a pretty meaningful syndicate. In terms of the RIAs, we have a team of about 12 people covering that marketplace, and we are actively pushing all three of those strategies right now, and having a lot of success. One thing I do want to comment about the wirehouse is, if you take a step back, you just think about bringing these products, you get on, you don't generate massive sales right away. It takes time. Remember, we're out - we're calling on all the big producers, and then the next layer and the layer beneath that of financial advisors. So, we have to educate them. We have to get them comfortable with the product. We've had great success, but as you think about where we are, I would tell you, we are in the very early innings of what we think we can achieve. Our penetration is nowhere near as high as a firm, let's say, like Blackstone. And I think we can get close to what they've achieved. It's just going to take us a little bit of time. Well, thanks, Operator, and thank you, everyone, for the questions. We do appreciate it. I just want to say, look, we're really pleased with our third quarter results, and we're hopeful that all of you take away that we've built a pretty unique firm with a very steady stream of income from permanent capital. And you tie that with meaningful growth, we think we have a stock that is poised to do quite well. I'll just add, we're grateful for everyone's support. We remain confident in where the firm is heading, and we look forward to hopefully continuing to exceed investors' expectations. So, thanks again."

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Blue Owl Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Ann Dai, Head of Investor Relations, you may start your conference. \nAnn Dai: Thanks, operator and good morning to everyone. Joining me today are Doug Ostrover, our Chief Executive Officer; Marc Lipschultz and Michael Rees, our Co-Presidents; and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer.  I'd like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company's control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in Blue Owl Capital's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We'd also like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website at blueowl.com. This morning, we issued our financial results for the second quarter of 2022 and reported fee-related earnings, or FRE of $0.14 per share and distributable earnings or DE of $0.13 per share. We also declared a dividend of $0.11 per share payable on August 29th to shareholders of record as of August 22nd. During the call today, we'll be referring to the earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning, so please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug.\nDouglas I. Ostrover: Thank you, Ann and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 7 of our earnings presentation, we reported yet another strong quarter of results for Blue Owl with AUM up 91%, management fees up 63%, and FRE up 52%, all from the second quarter of last year. We continue to experience growth across all verticals, underpinned by secular tailwinds, demand for our differentiated strategies, and expansion of Blue Owl's distribution platforms globally. And our significant permanent capital base accounting for 92% of our management fees in conjunction with our 100% FRE based earnings create resiliency and stability in our financial profile. Many of you were either in the audience or listening via webcast, when we had our Investor Day a couple of months ago. And when I think back on the key messages from that day, the business that you heard us describe is one that really stands out during markets like the one we're seeing now. And for those of you that weren't able to tune in for Investor Day, we talked about three key milestones for our business; raising $50 billion of fee-paying AUM across 2022 and 2023, achieving after-tax DE of $1 billion in 2023, and paying $1 dividend per share in 2025. We have always said we're striving to build a different type of alternative asset manager. We want to give you growth that is better than our peers, but with downside protection and absent the volatility of carried interest running through our financials. I think you've seen that clearly shown in our results this quarter, and I expect that to play out even more next quarter. So we look forward to continuing to demonstrate the strength of our differentiated model. Our view has always been that investors should appreciate and ascribe higher value to stable, steady and growing management fee streams. And we are now getting the chance to display that stability against a volatile and challenging market backdrop for our peers.  With that in mind, let me first offer some commentary on the broader market environment and Blue Owl's positioning before I cover our second quarter results. In a continuation of the trends we saw during the first quarter, inflation, interest rates and global GDP growth have remained in the spotlight, driving ongoing public markets volatility. This is exactly the type of environment where we are able to differentiate our business model and the value of our strategies. At the Blue Owl level, we have patient and permanent capital and resilient management fees, providing underlying support to our existing earnings profile even as we continue to grow, the layer cake analogy, and we anticipate a net positive impact to earnings as rates rise, particularly for our direct lending business, where Part 1 fees benefit from higher rates. At the strategy level, that same permanent capital allows us to provide flexible certain financing solutions to sponsors, corporations, and alternative asset managers during a time when liquidity is scarce and public markets are closed are much more expensive than they used to be. And for the investors in our strategies, our products offer attractive qualities in volatile uncertain markets, income generation, downside protection, and structural inflation hedges. All this to say, we feel very well positioned to navigate the current market environment. Pipelines remain robust across the business as we continue to see market share come our way in direct lending despite lower industry M&A volumes and across our businesses. We believe our scale and capital base create meaningful competitive advantages. This is one of the most favorable environments we've seen for direct lending since our inception seven years ago. and we fully intend to capture the attractive risk-adjusted opportunities we're seeing.  Moving on to our second quarter results, we continue to demonstrate steady and robust growth, with management fees growing 14% quarter-over-quarter and 63% year-over-year. Fundraising for the quarter was well diversified with over $7 billion of capital raised across strategies from both institutional and private wealth investors. Keep in mind, that's up from $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. That brings our last 12-month equity capital raised to $17.3 billion for organic growth of 28%. As we mentioned during our recent Investor Day, we launched our new wire house distributed tech lending product, ORTIC during the second quarter, closing on over $700 million through August 1st, primarily driven by one wirehouse in one geography and we are in the process of expanding the distribution for that product substantially over the coming quarters. This is in addition to the multiple closings we've had for our other tech lending BDC, ORTF2, which has now exceeded $3 billion of equity and which remains in the market and we continue to see good traction for a diversified lending strategy as well. Through August 1st, we have raised an additional $2 billion across direct lending of which private wealth constituted over half.  In GP Solutions, we raised $3 billion for Dow Fund V during the quarter and through August 1st, we've raised the subsequent $200 million to take the fund to approximately $10 billion. We anticipate wrapping up fundraising later this year which we expect will bring the fund to over $10.5 billion. And in real estate, we expect the second half of the year to be very active as we come to market with new products and next vintages of existing clients. What we hear often from our investors is that the defensive nature of our strategies and their focus on income generation and principal preservation are highly desirable during good markets, but they stand out even more during challenging environments. And we've been active in deployment across all of our strategies, moving us closer to the next big fund raise for each of those strategies. Looking ahead, the key messages that we've highlighted over the past year and most recently at Investor Day, should continue to resound in today's market. We see meaningful runway to raise capital across institutional and wealth channels and in our view, we have the right strategies, the right people, and deep investment expertise in place to invest that capital well. Permanent capital remains the cornerstone of our business, creating competitive advantages and supporting growth, and with each successive dollar of new assets raised we will continue to add new layers to Blue Owl's earnings power. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc to give you an update on our direct lending and real estate businesses. Marc?\nMarc S. Lipschultz: Great. Thanks so much, Doug. I'd like to pick up where Doug left off in his earlier comments about the terrific opportunities we're seeing in our direct lending business. We've been able to generate strong growth in that business through very constructive market environments, but these choppy markets are even more advantageous for us to deploy capital and are especially where direct lending strategies shine. As a scaled player in direct lending with patient permanent capital, we are well positioned to provide much-needed capital solutions at a time when liquidity is scarce and our market-leading position in tech lending has served us well. We continue to lead a number of large finances for large software firms and attractive spreads and low loan to values. Our continued capital formation puts us in a position to lead the biggest deals happening in the market today such as Zendesk and Anaplan.  So to use a recent example, we were recently named the admin agent on the senior credit facilities for Helman Improvement and Premier's acquisition of Zendesk, a scaled and fast-growing market leader in the customer support service market for midsize and enterprise customers. Zendesk's revenue is highly recurring with attractive retention metrics driven by a strong value proposition and expansion within its existing customer base, precisely the type of characteristics we look for when we've enhanced a software company. So for the first half of the year, we looked at nearly 50 deals with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion, exceeding the over 40 investments of that size, we evaluated in all of 2021 for the full year. Our pipeline remains very robust as sponsors sit on meaningful dry powder and continue to find attractive opportunities. We're also having conversations with various non-sponsored private companies looking for financing solutions. This is an excellent market with favorable supply-demand characteristics for us. For the second quarter, as you can see on Slide 13 of the earnings release, gross originations of $7.6 billion were up nearly 50% year-over-year and over 55% quarter-over-quarter. For the last 12 months, gross originations in direct lending have been $28.9 billion, more than double what we originated in the prior 12-month period. Although we expect capital markets activity will likely remain under pressure in the near term, we're cautiously optimistic that the back half of this year will remain quite active for our direct lending strategy. Credit quality across our direct lending portfolio remained very strong, and we are proud to say we have not had a single new nonaccrual for default in the quarter.  Our annualized net realized losses have remained at approximately 5 basis points since inception. And we continue to focus on downside protection, with a weighted average loan to value in the low 40s across our direct lending portfolio and in the low 30s across our tech portfolio. The interest coverage ratio across direct lending is roughly 3.3 times, we expect that even with a further 200 basis point rating, interest coverage will remain above 2.5 times. So our portfolio is very helpful. So far, we have seen great resiliency in the ability for our portfolio of companies we finance fast costs along to their other customers, protecting their businesses for margin compression. Now turning to performance for the 12 months, the direct lending portfolio appreciated 8% and for the second quarter, while March were negative due to spread widening on how we value our existing loans as a result, our portfolio continued to fundamentally perform very well. Let me take a second and comment on how we think about mark-to-market. You've heard me say this before, but it does bear repeating. While we care very deeply about the performance of our products, and it very much matters to us and the investors and our funds for this particular audience, performance and in particular, unrealized mark-to-market is not really impactful to our shareholders. As you saw during the quarter, there was deminimis impact on our management fees as a result of marks, as evidenced by the management fee growth in direct lending during a period in which public credit markets traded off significantly. Said another way, what we ultimately care about is good credit call and that we get paid back on our investments, and everything in between is simply noise. Unrealized marks from changes in spreads do not impact the overall performance of our investments or our dividends to our investors.  Now moving on to fundraising, we raised $3 billion direct lending strategies during the second quarter, of which wealth constituted $1.9 billion. This incorporates $500 million close for our new tech income fund and ongoing clauses for our core income fund. Furthermore, we've experienced very limited tenders in our core income fund. During the second quarter, investors requested tenders for a deminimis $28 million which compares to $10 billion of AUM in this fund. Subsequent to the end of second quarter, we closed an additional $2 billion across direct lending and more broadly, we continued to expand the distribution for all of our direct lending products flow. Now moving on to our real estate business. As we spoke about at Investor Day, we believe we are in an attractive investment environment and continue to see tailwinds for net lease as corporate borrowing costs continue to increase. As we stand here today, we have roughly $1.5 billion in transaction volume under letter of intent or contract close and a near-term pipeline of more than $25 billion of potential loss. As of today, we have invested over 55% of the equity in our fifth closed-end fund, putting us on track to launch our real estate Fund VI later this year. The pipeline for sale leasebacks is very robust, and the volatility of the markets continues to create opportunities. We've recently picked up approximately $900 million of broken deal flow at an average cap rate that is meaningfully better than that of the prior potential market [ph] but we expect to continue capitalizing on similar opportunities in a challenging financing market.  In addition, we launched our latest open-ended product, Net Lease Trust. We're currently in one large wirehouse with this product today, with an expectation to have the first close in the third quarter, and we will continue expanding. We are very excited about this net lease strategy generally and believe we have a very differentiated approach. Investors in this strategy will be able to access the advantages of the net lease structure, which targets an attractive 7% plus yield, primarily investment-grade counterparties with beneficial tax attributes, and we think this compares favorably to other strategies currently out there. You've heard us say this multiple times now, but I think it bears repeat; income generation, inflation litigation, and downside protection are what investors are looking for in markets such as these, and our net lease strategy provides just that. Since our real estate strategies inception, we have never had a tenant miss a single rent payment, go bankrupt or default on a lease, and we've generated a net IRR of 26% on average across our fully realized closed-end funds and gross appreciation across our real estate portfolio of 6.7% for the second quarter alone, and 30.4% for the last 12 months. These are strong risk-adjusted returns for the underlying credit profile of these portfolios. As you can tell, we are quite excited about our track record and strategy given the large opportunities that we see. So with that, let me turn it to Michael to discuss GP Capital Solutions.\nMichael Rees: Thank you, Marc. We continue to see a very constructive fundraising and investing environment for our GP Capital Solutions business, particularly given our positioning as an attractive and scaled source of capital for growing private managers. Continued growth across the alternative asset manager space not only drives our investable opportunity set as more firms seek growth equity, but it also drives cash flow from our partner managers as they continue to raise and deploy capital. As Doug mentioned earlier, during the second quarter, we closed on roughly $3 billion of new commitments for Dial Fund V, bringing total commitments to $9.8 billion. So far in the third quarter, we've raised an additional $200 million taking the fund to $10 billion. We are excited about the strong momentum and anticipating wrapping up fundraising later this year, which we expect will bring the fund to over $10.5 billion, exceeding the $9 billion we had on the cover. At $10.5 billion, the size of Fund V will be a record in the GP stakes industry and nearly twice as large as the next competitor. This puts us in a position to continue deploying capital into large firms with leading track records. As we've highlighted at our Investor Day, our market share of deals above $600 million in check size has been approximately 88%. We remained active on the capital deployment front as well, adding two positions in leading firms that are new partner managers as well as three commitments to firms we have funded previously. As you can see on Slide 16 of the earnings presentation, this brings total commitments for Dial V to $7.4 billion. Having already surpassed Fund V's target size by $1 billion as of August 1st and with additional capital expected to close this year, we anticipate the launch of Fund VI towards the end of 2023 with fees turning on in 2024.  Performance across the Dial funds remained strong with gross IRR of 31% for Fund III and 112% for Fund IV. Looking ahead, we're very optimistic about what the next 12 months holds for the GP Capital Solutions business. Not only is Dial well positioned within a very small set of firms that have scale and capability to provide growth capital to fund these managers, but we continue to partner with managers who are the greatest beneficiaries of flows to alternatives and GP consolidation. Overall, we see ample opportunities to take advantage of this dislocation in the current market environment. With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation, as Ann mentioned, so please feel free to have that available to follow along. Okay, let's start off by covering our quarterly results. We closed our acquisition of Wellfleet on April 1st, so you will see those numbers included in our results today. Our second quarter was another quarter of strong growth for our business. FRE revenues are up $45.2 million or 17% from last quarter and up 51% from the second quarter a year ago. Management fees are up $36.7 million or 14% from last quarter and up 63% from the second quarter a year ago. Broken down by divisions direct lending management fees are up $12 million or 9% from last quarter and 39% from the second quarter a year ago. GP Capital Solutions management fees are up $22.6 million or 21% from last quarter and up 70% from the second quarter a year ago. When you adjust for catch-up fees in Dial Fund V, we are up $12.8 million and real estate management fees are up $2.1 million or 12% from last quarter.  FRE is up $25.7 million or 15% from last quarter and up 52% from the second quarter a year ago. FRE margins are roughly flat from last quarter at approximately 62%. We expect this will tick down for the second half of this year due largely to distribution costs we expect to book in the remainder of the year. Our ratio of compensation as a percentage of revenue is roughly flat to last quarter at 27%. And we announced a dividend of $0.11 per share for the second quarter, up from $0.10 per share last quarter. All of this is in line with our expectations and what I noted on our earnings call last quarter and in February, we continue to be on track with reaching our 2022 goals of $1.3 billion of revenues and an FRE margin of 60%.  I wanted to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts as we put up very large numbers over the past four months. In the second quarter, we raised $7.2 billion and since quarter end, we have raised an additional $2.2 billion. So in total, we have raised $9.4 billion of equity commitments from April 1st through today. I'm going to break down these fundraising numbers across our products, so everyone has more transparency here. In direct lending, we raised $5 billion. $1.8 billion was raised for our core income BDC, OR CIC, which is now over $4.5 billion of equity. $1.7 billion was raised for ORTF2, which is now over $3 billion of equity, surpassing the size of ORTF. As a reminder, we earn fees on total assets for these two products which, including ORTIC, we have now raised approximately $7 billion of equity. And with a turn of leverage, that's approaching $15 billion of total assets for our tech dedicated products, $700 million in ORTIC, our Technology Wealth platform products and $500 million in CLOs. In GP Capital Solutions, we raised $4.2 billion, $3.2 billion was raised for Dial Fund V and an additional almost $1 billion of co-invest, which is fee free. In real estate, we raised $200 million and are in the process of launching two new products as you heard in more detail from Marc, a few minutes ago.  As it relates to our AUM metrics on Slide 11, we reported AUM of $119.1 billion, fee-paying AUM of $77.5 billion, and total permanent capital of $95.5 billion. AUM not yet paying fees, was $8.8 billion as of June 30th. AUM grew $17.1 billion to $119.1 billion, an increase of 17% from last quarter and a 91% increase from the second quarter a year ago. Fee paying AUM grew $11.9 billion to $77.5 million, an 18% increase from last quarter and an 81% increase from the second quarter a year ago. Both metrics driven primarily by deployment of capital and direct lending, capital raised in Dial Fund V, and when looking at the growth from a year ago, the addition of our real estate and CLO businesses.  Permanent capital grew $9.9 billion to $95.5 billion, an 11% increase from last quarter and a 68% increase from the second quarter a year ago, driven primarily by deployment in direct lending, capital raised in Dial Fund V, as well as the addition of our real estate business when compared to a year ago. AUM not yet paying fees was $8.8 billion, including $6.4 billion in direct lending, $0.8 billion in GP Capital Solutions, and $1.6 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling over $105 million. As Marc highlighted earlier, we had another strong quarter of deployment in direct lending, with gross originations of $7.6 billion and net funded deployment of $4.6 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $28.9 billion with $16 billion of net funded deployments. So as it relates to the $6.4 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us less than two quarters to fully deploy this based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on Slide 22, we currently have over $1 billion of liquidity with an average 14-year maturity and low 2.9% fixed cost. So to wrap up here before getting to Q&A, there's a few last items I want to cover. On distribution costs, last quarter, I talked about a large onetime upfront distribution or placement fee expense, on certain equity dollars raised. Some of that we closed during 2Q and the rest, the majority of what I was referring to last quarter will close in the second half of the year. During the second quarter, we had distribution costs elevated by upper single-digit millions versus the first quarter, and the majority of what we expected will now be booked in the second half of the year. On our Investor Day we held in May, we put out some financial milestones we wanted to achieve. These milestones included achieving $1.3 billion of revenue this year and a 60% FRE margin, as well as milestones for 2023, which included doubling our 2021 revenues to $1.8 billion, hitting $1 billion of after-tax distributable earnings, and raising $50 billion of fee-paying AUM during 2022 and 2023 combined. As I noted earlier, although we're all facing a pretty choppy market environment with strong headwinds, we are on track with our 2022 goals, and I'll note here, we are also on track with our 2023 goals, including our $50 billion fundraising goal. Of the $50 billion, we have raised $10.5 billion through June 30th and an additional $2.2 billion through today. At the end of June, we were added to the Russell 1000 and 3000. That was a process we have been very focused on being a part of, and we're glad to be included in these indices. Both on last quarter's earnings call as well as at Investor Day, I commented on the rising rate environment we're in and the potential impact that could have on our business. I've included here again on Slide 14 the impact of rising rates to our direct lending business. We are expecting to see a lift in our management fee line in the third quarter due to rising rates as well as another possible lift in the fourth quarter. If the Fed continues to raise rates, we would expect continued increases to our management fee line due to an increase in Part 1 fees across our BDC business.  So summing it all up, we are very pleased with our results again this quarter, delivering double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter in all of our key metrics, AUM, fee paying AUM, FRE revenues, FRE and DE. We are hitting in all of our key metrics, and we continue to have very exciting growth plans ahead of us as outlined during our Investor Day, which we feel we continue to be well positioned to execute on. Thank you again to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that, operator, can we please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein. Your line is open. \nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning everybody. Thank you for the question. So maybe we could start with just more details around the retail channel. Obviously, it's a huge growth opportunity and a focus for you guys and nice to see traction there. Environment has changed pretty materially, but it doesn't seem like there's been a lot of negative impact on you guys just based on some of the reduction comments that you had earlier in the prepared remarks. So I was hoping to get a better sense in terms of how much of the net flows are coming from sort of existing platforms versus maybe some of the newer ones that you've added, just to get a better sense of kind of same-store sale dynamics? And then you mentioned a lot of numbers, so I was hoping to unpack this a little bit. But the $2 billion that you raised so far in direct lending in the third quarter, I just want to double check that that's effectively through early August, and maybe you can give us a sense of sort of the open-ended products versus kind of continued fund rate towards the up to?\nDouglas I. Ostrover: Why don't I -- good morning Alex, why don\u2019t I have Alan start on the $2 billion direct lending piece, and then I can address retail.\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Doug. Hey, good morning Alex. The answer is yes, it grew effectively today. So it includes the August 1st close as well as the July 1st close for our wealth distributed products.\nDouglas I. Ostrover: And then let me just start by saying in fund raising this quarter, we were really pleased. It was a great quarter. We raised $7.2 billion. I think, as Alan mentioned, $3.6 billion of that came from wealth, and that's versus $2.2 billion in the first quarter. And I think I have this number right, it's about $1.3 billion has been raised from wealth, quarter-to-date. So continue to do well, definitely seeing a little bit of weakness. We're reiterating our $50 billion of fundraising goal for the next 2022 and 2023. We mentioned that our tenders have been deminimis, just $28 million in the second quarter out of $10 billion. And so over the intermediate and longer term, our views haven't changed. We're confident in our ability to continue to raise capital from wealth. And I think the products we're offering in the channel have attributes that really resonate, lots of income generation, downside protection, positive leverage to rising rates, especially in direct lending. I think at our last call, we talked about the wealth channel and how allocations thoughts remain very low. In Investor Day, you'll remember, we put up a number that we thought the wealth channel would control $220 trillion by 2025, and that an incremental 20% of that could move into the alternative market, that's $40 trillion to $50 trillion. So when we talk about wealth, our enthusiasm hasn't waned at all. In fact, we're more excited than ever. We have spent a lot of time building our brand. Our distribution now is truly global as good as anyone in the market. You know we've been at this since the day we launched approximately seven years. So I think we're in a really unique position to not only continue to maintain market share but to grow market share in that channel for the next number of years. Just to reiterate, super excited about it and hopefully, Marc mentioned this, you'll start to see that as we roll out our nontraded REIT.\nAlexander Blostein: Great, thanks for all that color. My second question is probably for Alan, around the G&A commentary on the distribution cost, understanding that, that could be pretty lumpy, obviously, based on this quarter results and sounds like that number is coming up next quarter. But I guess, a) maybe you could just kind of help us clean up what you actually expect G&A dollars to be for Q3, Q4, just to get some of the noise out of the way. But more importantly, as you guys are expanding into more distribution platforms, can you just kind of help us think about the framework of how holistically distribution costs work for you guys, whether it's a basis points on retail AUM or some framework around that would be helpful?\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: Yes, of course, Alex. Thanks for the question. So look, when I think about placement costs for the rest of this year, for 3Q, we could expect $20 million to $25 million incremental from our 1Q level. And for 4Q, we could potentially expect and look, this is subject to obviously to where we end up actually fundraising and where fundraising levels end up in 4Q, but an additional $15 million to $25 million incremental from 1Q. Please don't extrapolate the amount of fundraising that we did in 2Q relative to the placement cost and extrapolate fundraising to 3Q and 4Q. The costs vary and I'll talk -- I'll answer your second question in a second. The costs vary quite a bit across different wealth and wirehouse platforms. And just to pull the lens back for a minute, although these -- some of these numbers are big numbers for our G&A line, I would pay these costs every day of the week, right. I've talked about last quarter, if we raised, let's say, $1 billion as an example and we pay, let's assume $20 million to $25 million in placement costs for that, and that's blended across again, different wirehouse and wealth platform costs, that would over time, equate to roughly $30 million or $40 million of annual management. So it effectively, it does pay itself off in one year. And so to answer your second question, there are some platforms that charge everything upfront. There are some platforms that charge a small amount upfront and an annual trail over time. Generally speaking, we could pay 2% to 4% either upfront or over time, depending on that platform.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. But just I guess to close this topic, the elevated distribution costs that you guys can see from placing these products in the back half of the year, is that largely a 2022 dynamic because you're getting the new platforms, and you obviously have RCF2 and a couple of other large kind of launches or do you think the distribution expense run rate could ultimately be higher in 2023 as well?\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: I think we're going to continue to ramp up what we're doing across the retail and wealth platform channels. And it certainly could be something that you'll see for the foreseeable short and intermediate term. And look, that -- with that said, keep in mind in my prepared remarks, I commented on where we think we're going to be in 2022. Our guidance continues to be spot on with where we expect to end the year, right. The $1.3 billion of revenue, 60% FRE margins, which equates to $780 million of FRE, and the 2023 goals that we put out there, the milestones that both Doug and I commented on, on the call, in our prepared remarks, we continue to feel very good about those milestones, and we continue to feel that we will achieve those milestones. Everything we just talked about for placement costs is already embedded in our expectations for 2022 and 2023. So there's nothing -- there's no new incremental distribution costs here that we see today or in the foreseeable future that would change the guidance we've already given.\nAlexander Blostein: Very helpful, thanks so much.\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: Of course. Thank you. Thank you very much, Alex.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello, thanks very much. A question on the direct lending side. I think I got the numbers right. You mentioned 50 deals in the first half, over $1 billion versus 40 of all last year that you've looked at. So the question I have is if you could help peel back the onion of what is it that's driving this higher activity level because it's not just you, it seems like that marketplace is expanding, you happen to be great in it, but is it the deal structures that you can provide the relationships, anything to do with rates, maybe lower capital ratios at banks, just curious on how you're sourcing them and the big picture drivers there? Thanks. \nMarc S. Lipschultz: Great. Thanks, Glenn. First of all, definitely I want to echo your comment. I think we're great at it. So here's what's happening, we're seeing a continued market share evolution. Look, at the end of the day, there's a very big marketplace out there for capital solutions. And the direct lending is a minority portion of it and will be a minority portion of it probably for a very long time. That said, there's $2 trillion of dry powder in the hands of private equity firms. And just assuming one turn of leverage, that's $2 trillion of incremental demand for financings, plus you got to refinance the trillions of dollars of financing that's already in place in the market. So from the point of view of where Blue Owl sits, it's a nearly limitless sort of white space, so to speak. And what's happening for us in particular, and as you know, it's not for us alone, the market in total for direct lending, has been growing, and it's been growing for, I think, a few reasons. One, of course, has been the expansion of the depth of the pools of capital we have to offer. So our relevance to the ever larger financing opportunities has changed over the last five years. And that you can see in those same calculations, that 50 deals over $1 billion that we looked at, you go back to, say 2016, there were zero of that scale that were relevant to -- that have been done in direct lending. So it is an evolution of the depths of capital pools.  It's also very importantly, I think most importantly, that we've been able to prove that the model for direct lending, when we started Blue Owl, we really had a view that what we wanted to take was a direct lending business whose legacy had been a lender of last resort, for the companies that sort of couldn't get financed elsewhere and turn it into the lender of first choice for the best companies and the best sponsors. And that meant creating the value proposition. And today, what we call the 3P is, right, predictability, privacy and partnership. People, I think, call them, in many cases, the very best firms, the best companies to say, look, I understand we pay more spread. I understand it's a tougher document, but I really appreciate the value proposition that comes with it. And so today, this year, think about this, we at Blue Owl have led Anaplan, $10 billion plus take private, was announced that we're leading Zendesk, another $10 billion plus take private. Yesterday, you may have seen that Tomarabo announced Ping, we're the lead in financing the Ping take private. So I think you've just seen this model and its value proposition to these world-class companies, world-class sponsor to prove out.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. I appreciate all that. Whoever wants to take this one, I'm just curious on what factors we should be looking at or what you're looking at that might indicate closer towards listing of the BDCs? Thanks. \nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: Sure. Of course, Glenn, we obviously can't comment on the timing of an IPO with an SEC registrant. I would comment that the ORTF portfolio is fully invested, fully deployed, fully levered. Our shareholders are enjoying a great cash-on-cash return, dividend, IRR, the ORCC 3 portfolio is fully invested, fully deployed, fully levered. And ORTF, we're just now continuing to ramp. We've now exceeded the size of ORTF, as I mentioned on the call. But we have a long way to go in terms of deploying that capital. So maybe I'll leave it there, if that's okay.\nGlenn Schorr: Sure. If you're not able to comment on just the factors that lead to it not the timing, in other words, what market conditions might make it more reasonable?\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: Sure. So the factors I just mentioned, certainly is a large contributor towards the timing. So ORCC 3 is a more recently raised product. But ORTF, we raised in 2018. ORCC, we did about a little less than three and half years from the initial close to the IPO, ORTF we raised in 2018. So that's been about four years. The factors, like I said, fully invested, fully deployed, fully levered are certainly a contributing factor. And now we're just looking for a good market environment, which just isn't there right now.\nDouglas I. Ostrover: Yes. I'll just make one quick comment. At the end of the day, we want to give our investors liquidity. They want it. We want to give it to them. But we're all in agreement that we want to do it at a time where we feel really good that when we listed, it will trade well. And we're certainly not in that environment today. There's virtually no IPOs. So as you think about the right environment, think about an environment where it's a fairly robust environment to get IPOs done. And I think we will be one of the firms that list and get a good reception, because it is, as Alan mentioned, it's a mature portfolio doing well. And I think when the time is right, I think our marketplace will find it interesting.\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: Yes. And another factor, just to add maybe one more component is you want a really good portfolio to take to market, really pristine from a credit perspective. And you really couldn't ask for more with ORTF. We've had no defaults, no arrears [ph]. Our portfolio has been performing in an incredible way since inception. So that is certainly another factor when you think about taking something to the market, that's certainly a material component of how we think about it.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you for all that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi, good morning, everyone. First question is on kind of the tenor of transaction fees. It looks like your deployment and funding was more like 4Q 2021, but the transaction fee was meaning below the $39 million you reported then. So could you flesh out the dynamics around those kind of disconnects between deployment and the actual transaction fees again as we think about how it looks going forward?\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: Sure, happy to Patrick. So I've commented on prior calls. Sometimes you'll see originations up, transaction fees could be flat or slightly up. They're not going to move in total lockstep. It's really going to depend on which deals we lead, which deals we participate in. So there's a number of factors that go into that. You certainly can see transaction fees up strongly versus 1Q. 1Q tends to be a slower quarter seasonally from a transaction fee perspective. But we certainly -- transaction fees are where we would have generally expected them this quarter.\nPatrick Davitt: Okay, thanks. And then I do want to go back to the distribution discussion again. I think you guided to $25 million, $30 million in mid-2Q placement fees which I would assume would be a timing you'd have good visibility on that number, so what were the dynamics that made it so much lower than you were expecting? And should we -- does that mean that the guidance you just gave for 3Q and 4Q is pretty fluid?\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: So the -- when I spoke last quarter, it really was driven by the timing of when we closed the capital and so the timing of when we closed the capital as opposed to part of that coming in 2Q, part of that slipped to 3Q. And so what you're seeing is the 3Q guidance I gave, I feel very good about. The 4Q guidance is anticipating a certain level of fundraising that we just -- we can't predict sitting here today. But the 3Q numbers, I feel very comfortable providing.\nPatrick Davitt: Got it, thank you. \nDouglas I. Ostrover: Thank you Patrick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning everyone. Hope you are all doing well. \nDouglas I. Ostrover: Thanks Craig, doing great. \nCraig Siegenthaler: So my question is on the Wellfleet acquisition, which closed on April 1st. Do you guys have handy what the management fee and FRE contribution was in the second quarter? And as we're forecasting into 3Q and 4Q, is this a good run rate to build off of for 3Q?\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: So we don't take divisions down to the FRE level, Craig. But I can certainly tell you that the revenue contribution to the direct lending business from Wellfleet was in the mid to upper single-digit millions. And yes, that you can anticipate that as a run rate going forward, we will grow that business. So certainly, we'll look to add to that over the coming quarters as we continue to launch CLOs, but that's a good base to start with.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great, thank you Alan. And just as my follow-up, I know you hit on retail flows overall, earlier in the call, but how have ORCIC's flows trended since June 30th?\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: So we had a -- we've done a July 1 and August 1 close. Those numbers have trended down a little bit, not dramatically, but they have trended down a little bit, which would be in line with our expectations. And maybe I would argue better than what we've been seeing in the industry.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great, thank you Alan. Take care everyone. \nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: Very well, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Brian McKenna [ph]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks. So just to follow up on direct lending. There's clearly a significant amount of deployment opportunities across the market, and this is just going to steadily increase over time for a number of reasons that you already touched on. But how do you think about the size of your investment team in place today to continue to successfully underwrite deals? And what's the expectation for related headcount growth in the business longer term?\nMarc S. Lipschultz: Thanks for the question. And you hit on a really important point, which is to do this business well it is a very people-intensive business. That is to say it's a very intensive work exercise, right. We have to do a tremendous amount of investing in origination to find the thousands and thousands of opportunities that we look at to do the very small number we ultimately do. Deep due diligence, extensive work on credit agreements, which as we've said before, to sound arcane is really important part of what we do in terms of protecting capital. So this is a business that we've had to invest very heavily in building the team. Now we have done that. We have one of the largest dedicated teams in the world to do this, we have coming up on 100 people, professionals doing direct lending and that's really what we live and breathe. So I think we're very, very well staffed to support the level of activities we have. We'll always be continuing to look to build our team and make sure we have the best team on the field, and we're always being proactive and finding the best opportunities. But we look back to our activity levels in 4Q last year, look at this quarter, we're in very good shape to support the kind of level of activity that we're talking about and seeing. \nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Helpful. And then just broadly, you've done a couple of strategic transactions recently, but I'm curious, just given the backdrop more broadly today, are conversations picking up at all for additional M&A and what are the some of the more interesting areas you would potentially look to expand into inorganically?\nMarc S. Lipschultz: So the pace of activity in those conversations has picked up, as you've said. Now pace of activity mean the pace of available opportunities and conversations available to have. We're going to continue to be extremely selective. Remember, in Oak Street, what we had and have is just a market leader, extraordinary risk-return results, great team, a great leader in Mark Zar. So it's a great culture fit as a result and we won't need all of that to make an acquisition. Well, similarly, not as large, of course and strategic but again, a fantastic team, a great culture fit and a great complement to our core business. So we're in the picks and shovels business. We're in the capital solutions business and so you should, I think, continue to think about us looking for places where we can adopt other solutions that are adjacent. We can be another go-to source of capital, particularly for this private markets ecosystem.  So we have a foothold in real estate today and a very strong one at that. It's obviously a very large space that we can continue to explore. We are a very U.S. centric business collectively today. Obviously, we're -- we could explore things outside the U.S. So I think you'll continue to see us be very engaged. In a world where the IPOs managers is no longer a particularly practical idea for most today, I think we will continue to see people who are saying, I see an opportunity to grow, I like the benefits of being part of a larger platform, and we're going to continue to engage with those folks and selectively hopefully add to the platform.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks Marc.\nMarc S. Lipschultz: Thank you Brian. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty. Your line is open.\nAdam Beatty: Hello, thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the vastly kind of increased pipeline in direct lending that you're seeing. It's a multiyear theme, you call it out at the Investor Day, of banks kind of pulling back from some of that. I imagine, given the current environment, that stepped up a bit. And you also mentioned kind of non-sponsor activity being a little bit more prominent. So my question is, how sustainable is that, particularly on the non-sponsor side, would you expect a little bit of reversion, or is the pie just growing from here in the future? Thanks. \nMarc S. Lipschultz: I think and obviously, time will tell, I think the pie will continue to grow because there's a great value proposition. Really, at the end of the day, again, we're clear. We -- our loans -- we charge more, and there's no doubt that our documents are more restrictive and rigorous, but we offer people absolute certainty on their capital. They're going to have the money at the time and place they want it on the terms that they want it, that predictability. Private equity, and you want to be able to take a long-term view to build these businesses. We're the match to that. We're the private credit. We bring the whole system together and take a view of where you want to be three years from now to have a bigger, better business, and partnership. When things like the pandemic hit or current uncertainties in the world arise today, knowing you can speak to your partner, the person who owns in our case, on average, lend through kind of the low 40% value of an enterprise we are going to call that person saying let's talk about the future and getting from here to there, that's worth it.  And so what I think we're seeing is two things happening in today's market, the continued overall secular trend, which is, hey, that's a great value proposition. And once people try it, many people, great sponsors, great companies, private businesses alike, return to it, saying that was a really good experience. I'm going to do that again. So that becomes like a step function increase in the marketplace that we work with. Then there's another thing happening today that we should keep an eye on, which is, look, there is basically no meaningful syndicated market. So today, if you want to make a large acquisition, really direct lending is the primary opportunity, the primary option. So there's certainly also a bit of a cyclical element right now in terms of available opportunities to direct lending. So it's a combination of both that we're seeing, but the secular trend is the more powerful one. And I think as long as we continue to develop pools of capital and deliver the value proposition, that should continue. I will say that one of the -- the greater challenge from where we sit and I think where the market will sit is we just don't have enough capital to meet the need. We don't have enough capital to make the loans that, frankly, today, we deem very attractive. We're seeing some of the best risk return opportunities we've seen since inception. And we don't have the capital to meet it and nor does the industry for that matter. So the bigger challenge, I think, gets down to capital allocators deciding and recognizing the opportunity here to have a safe floating rate experience, which is what we offer and delivering the capital so that we can in turn deliver it through our platforms to these great companies. \nAdam Beatty: That's interesting, yes, about the constraints around capital. Maybe kind of to that point, you talked a little bit about resources around direct lending in terms of underwriting and diligence and what have you. In terms of distribution, maybe ramping up the capital gathering even more. Where do you see -- how far along are you in kind of the build-out of that globally, how much more in terms of resources should we expect either to meet your fundraising targets or maybe go a little bit beyond that in the coming years? Thank you. \nDouglas I. Ostrover: Yes. This is Doug. Thanks for the question. Look, since the Dial merger, we've really ramped up our global distribution. One of the things we got really excited about when we merged with Dial then with Oak Street was there was very little overlap between our LP base. In fact, shockingly like 2% to 3%. And so we are in the very early stages of cross-selling one another's products to each of these LPs. And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but we are having really good success. To answer your question, I'd say we're probably 85% of the way there. There's one or two jurisdictions that will probably add a few people. But from a cost standpoint, I think it's a deminimis cost and I don't think it will have any impact on the financials.\nAdam Beatty: Great, very helpful. Thank you Doug. \nOperator: Your next line comes from the line of Ken Worthington. Your line is open.\nKenneth Worthington: Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. First on direct lending credit quality, there seems to be a fair amount of anxiety about credit quality going into the second half or the latter half of the year. You seem sanguine about credit today, you highlighted the low LTVs and high coverage. But this anxiety persists. Is investor anxiety misguided, maybe what are your thoughts here?\nMarc S. Lipschultz: I think people should be anxious about markets, but not just now. I mean that is to say our business in direct lending is built for exactly this environment. So we performed very well during strong times as we have for the past many years, but our -- we really shine in times like this, this is what we're built for, senior secured loans against very large companies, very high-quality, world-class businesses with world-class sponsors, floating rate exposure. So this is really the market we're built for. So I wouldn't say that anxiety is misplaced, it's a very uncertain world out there. I would say probably investors should be kind of anxious but because you're anxious is the reason you go to direct lending, you say, I want to be senior secured I want to be at the top of the capital structure. I want to be protected from interest rate changes. And I want to do that with people that do vigorous underwriting, deeply in origination, work with the best sponsors and work with the best company. So I think our particular position in the market for specifically because that's really our strike zone, which are the best companies best sponsors, that's really our strike zone. That's a particularly strong place to be. Really important point to note for this audience is what we all care tremendously about the performance of our portfolio and presumably, I think shows our since assumption performance was 5 basis points annualized loss rates. Remember, for the shareholders, people on this call it doesn't matter really at all. That is to say we are an entirely fee-based business, right. 100% of our revenues are fee based. So unlike anybody else in the marketplace where there's carry heavily embedded in their alt structures, we don't have that carry component, we're fee-based. So we care a lot about credit quality, and we're -- fair to say one of the best at it. But for you all as shareholders, to be clear, it actually doesn't affect the results.\nKenneth Worthington: Okay. Perfect. And I apologize if I missed this, what were the catch-up fees this quarter?\nAlan J. Kirshenbaum: Catch-up fees were $12.8 million. \nKenneth Worthington: Okay, awesome. Thank you very much.\nDouglas I. Ostrover: Thank you Ken.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Chris Kotowski [ph]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst : Yes, good morning and thanks. I wonder if you can just give us a bit more color on the handoff from Dial V to Dial VI. I think we're all kind of used to the typical private equity structure where you raise a X billion dollar fund and then it gets invested over three, four, five years, whereas the Dial funds seem to be more on a pays just-in-time kind of fundraising basis. Is that what you anticipate for Dial VI and any idea when you start fundraising for it and then how much a year comes in, is it coming in at a couple of billion a year over four years or how is it going to work?\nMichael Rees: Yes, well thanks for the question. As we look at the business for GP Solutions, Q2 and into Q3 is really highlighting the strategic position of our business and the Dial funds. We are seeing increased demand from investors so our fund size, we were able to increase. We're also seeing a really strong and building pipeline of continued deals with the biggest and what we believe to be the best players in this space. So we are, at the same time, raising a larger fund but we're deploying it in real time. So it means that we'll be back out on the road in calendar 2023. We'll have plenty of dry powder to get us into the beginning of 2023, but we'll want to make sure that Fund VI, that handoff is ready at some point in that calendar year, and we expect the fees to turn on towards the end of the year or very beginning of the following. But it's important for us to have ample capital but our investors like to see some of the portfolio names and the strength of it as we go, which is why having this market-leading position, we believe we have partners like CBC and Veritas and HIG and Dragonair and many, many others like it, is such a strong position to market from. So I hope that answered your question, but really proud of the quarter and the way we were able to put the Fund V finishing touches on and then start setting our sights on Fund VI.\nDouglas I. Ostrover: And Chris, I want you to know all of us in the room are really grateful that you asked a question about the GP Solutions business because as Michael said, I think there was some skepticism in the market of us hitting our target. We've exceeded it handily, and that fund is doing really well. The investors are thrilled and as you alluded to, I think it's setting us up for a really successful Fund VI sometime in the not-too-distant future.\nUnidentified Analyst : Great, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks. \nMichael Rees: Thank you Chris. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. CEO, Doug Ostrover, I turn the call back over to you.\nDouglas I. Ostrover: Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Hopefully, you got a sense that our business continues to have really good momentum. Just to reiterate one thing we talked about at Investor Day, we put up a slide at the end with three words: stability, predictability and growth. And I think what this quarter demonstrated is that we have a unique model. We have more permanent capital than any of our peers with best-in-class growth. So we're excited for what lays ahead. We're grateful for everyone's support, and I hope everyone enjoys the rest of the summer. And hopefully, we'll have a chance to see all of you soon. Thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan J. Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation, as Ann mentioned, so please feel free to have that available to follow along. Okay, let's start off by covering our quarterly results. We closed our acquisition of Wellfleet on April 1st, so you will see those numbers included in our results today. Our second quarter was another quarter of strong growth for our business. FRE revenues are up $45.2 million or 17% from last quarter and up 51% from the second quarter a year ago. Management fees are up $36.7 million or 14% from last quarter and up 63% from the second quarter a year ago. Broken down by divisions direct lending management fees are up $12 million or 9% from last quarter and 39% from the second quarter a year ago. GP Capital Solutions management fees are up $22.6 million or 21% from last quarter and up 70% from the second quarter a year ago. When you adjust for catch-up fees in Dial Fund V, we are up $12.8 million and real estate management fees are up $2.1 million or 12% from last quarter.  FRE is up $25.7 million or 15% from last quarter and up 52% from the second quarter a year ago. FRE margins are roughly flat from last quarter at approximately 62%. We expect this will tick down for the second half of this year due largely to distribution costs we expect to book in the remainder of the year. Our ratio of compensation as a percentage of revenue is roughly flat to last quarter at 27%. And we announced a dividend of $0.11 per share for the second quarter, up from $0.10 per share last quarter. All of this is in line with our expectations and what I noted on our earnings call last quarter and in February, we continue to be on track with reaching our 2022 goals of $1.3 billion of revenues and an FRE margin of 60%.  I wanted to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts as we put up very large numbers over the past four months. In the second quarter, we raised $7.2 billion and since quarter end, we have raised an additional $2.2 billion. So in total, we have raised $9.4 billion of equity commitments from April 1st through today. I'm going to break down these fundraising numbers across our products, so everyone has more transparency here. In direct lending, we raised $5 billion. $1.8 billion was raised for our core income BDC, OR CIC, which is now over $4.5 billion of equity. $1.7 billion was raised for ORTF2, which is now over $3 billion of equity, surpassing the size of ORTF. As a reminder, we earn fees on total assets for these two products which, including ORTIC, we have now raised approximately $7 billion of equity. And with a turn of leverage, that's approaching $15 billion of total assets for our tech dedicated products, $700 million in ORTIC, our Technology Wealth platform products and $500 million in CLOs. In GP Capital Solutions, we raised $4.2 billion, $3.2 billion was raised for Dial Fund V and an additional almost $1 billion of co-invest, which is fee free. In real estate, we raised $200 million and are in the process of launching two new products as you heard in more detail from Marc, a few minutes ago.  As it relates to our AUM metrics on Slide 11, we reported AUM of $119.1 billion, fee-paying AUM of $77.5 billion, and total permanent capital of $95.5 billion. AUM not yet paying fees, was $8.8 billion as of June 30th. AUM grew $17.1 billion to $119.1 billion, an increase of 17% from last quarter and a 91% increase from the second quarter a year ago. Fee paying AUM grew $11.9 billion to $77.5 million, an 18% increase from last quarter and an 81% increase from the second quarter a year ago. Both metrics driven primarily by deployment of capital and direct lending, capital raised in Dial Fund V, and when looking at the growth from a year ago, the addition of our real estate and CLO businesses.  Permanent capital grew $9.9 billion to $95.5 billion, an 11% increase from last quarter and a 68% increase from the second quarter a year ago, driven primarily by deployment in direct lending, capital raised in Dial Fund V, as well as the addition of our real estate business when compared to a year ago. AUM not yet paying fees was $8.8 billion, including $6.4 billion in direct lending, $0.8 billion in GP Capital Solutions, and $1.6 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling over $105 million. As Marc highlighted earlier, we had another strong quarter of deployment in direct lending, with gross originations of $7.6 billion and net funded deployment of $4.6 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $28.9 billion with $16 billion of net funded deployments. So as it relates to the $6.4 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us less than two quarters to fully deploy this based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on Slide 22, we currently have over $1 billion of liquidity with an average 14-year maturity and low 2.9% fixed cost. So to wrap up here before getting to Q&A, there's a few last items I want to cover. On distribution costs, last quarter, I talked about a large onetime upfront distribution or placement fee expense, on certain equity dollars raised. Some of that we closed during 2Q and the rest, the majority of what I was referring to last quarter will close in the second half of the year. During the second quarter, we had distribution costs elevated by upper single-digit millions versus the first quarter, and the majority of what we expected will now be booked in the second half of the year. On our Investor Day we held in May, we put out some financial milestones we wanted to achieve. These milestones included achieving $1.3 billion of revenue this year and a 60% FRE margin, as well as milestones for 2023, which included doubling our 2021 revenues to $1.8 billion, hitting $1 billion of after-tax distributable earnings, and raising $50 billion of fee-paying AUM during 2022 and 2023 combined. As I noted earlier, although we're all facing a pretty choppy market environment with strong headwinds, we are on track with our 2022 goals, and I'll note here, we are also on track with our 2023 goals, including our $50 billion fundraising goal. Of the $50 billion, we have raised $10.5 billion through June 30th and an additional $2.2 billion through today. At the end of June, we were added to the Russell 1000 and 3000. That was a process we have been very focused on being a part of, and we're glad to be included in these indices. Both on last quarter's earnings call as well as at Investor Day, I commented on the rising rate environment we're in and the potential impact that could have on our business. I've included here again on Slide 14 the impact of rising rates to our direct lending business. We are expecting to see a lift in our management fee line in the third quarter due to rising rates as well as another possible lift in the fourth quarter. If the Fed continues to raise rates, we would expect continued increases to our management fee line due to an increase in Part 1 fees across our BDC business.  So summing it all up, we are very pleased with our results again this quarter, delivering double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter in all of our key metrics, AUM, fee paying AUM, FRE revenues, FRE and DE. We are hitting in all of our key metrics, and we continue to have very exciting growth plans ahead of us as outlined during our Investor Day, which we feel we continue to be well positioned to execute on. Thank you again to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that, operator, can we please open the line for questions. Thanks, Doug. Hey, good morning Alex. The answer is yes, it grew effectively today. So it includes the August 1st close as well as the July 1st close for our wealth distributed products. Yes, of course, Alex. Thanks for the question. So look, when I think about placement costs for the rest of this year, for 3Q, we could expect $20 million to $25 million incremental from our 1Q level. And for 4Q, we could potentially expect and look, this is subject to obviously to where we end up actually fundraising and where fundraising levels end up in 4Q, but an additional $15 million to $25 million incremental from 1Q. Please don't extrapolate the amount of fundraising that we did in 2Q relative to the placement cost and extrapolate fundraising to 3Q and 4Q. The costs vary and I'll talk -- I'll answer your second question in a second. The costs vary quite a bit across different wealth and wirehouse platforms. And just to pull the lens back for a minute, although these -- some of these numbers are big numbers for our G&A line, I would pay these costs every day of the week, right. I've talked about last quarter, if we raised, let's say, $1 billion as an example and we pay, let's assume $20 million to $25 million in placement costs for that, and that's blended across again, different wirehouse and wealth platform costs, that would over time, equate to roughly $30 million or $40 million of annual management. So it effectively, it does pay itself off in one year. And so to answer your second question, there are some platforms that charge everything upfront. There are some platforms that charge a small amount upfront and an annual trail over time. Generally speaking, we could pay 2% to 4% either upfront or over time, depending on that platform. I think we're going to continue to ramp up what we're doing across the retail and wealth platform channels. And it certainly could be something that you'll see for the foreseeable short and intermediate term. And look, that -- with that said, keep in mind in my prepared remarks, I commented on where we think we're going to be in 2022. Our guidance continues to be spot on with where we expect to end the year, right. The $1.3 billion of revenue, 60% FRE margins, which equates to $780 million of FRE, and the 2023 goals that we put out there, the milestones that both Doug and I commented on, on the call, in our prepared remarks, we continue to feel very good about those milestones, and we continue to feel that we will achieve those milestones. Everything we just talked about for placement costs is already embedded in our expectations for 2022 and 2023. So there's nothing -- there's no new incremental distribution costs here that we see today or in the foreseeable future that would change the guidance we've already given. Of course. Thank you. Thank you very much, Alex. Sure. Of course, Glenn, we obviously can't comment on the timing of an IPO with an SEC registrant. I would comment that the ORTF portfolio is fully invested, fully deployed, fully levered. Our shareholders are enjoying a great cash-on-cash return, dividend, IRR, the ORCC 3 portfolio is fully invested, fully deployed, fully levered. And ORTF, we're just now continuing to ramp. We've now exceeded the size of ORTF, as I mentioned on the call. But we have a long way to go in terms of deploying that capital. So maybe I'll leave it there, if that's okay. Sure. So the factors I just mentioned, certainly is a large contributor towards the timing. So ORCC 3 is a more recently raised product. But ORTF, we raised in 2018. ORCC, we did about a little less than three and half years from the initial close to the IPO, ORTF we raised in 2018. So that's been about four years. The factors, like I said, fully invested, fully deployed, fully levered are certainly a contributing factor. And now we're just looking for a good market environment, which just isn't there right now. Yes. And another factor, just to add maybe one more component is you want a really good portfolio to take to market, really pristine from a credit perspective. And you really couldn't ask for more with ORTF. We've had no defaults, no arrears [ph]. Our portfolio has been performing in an incredible way since inception. So that is certainly another factor when you think about taking something to the market, that's certainly a material component of how we think about it. Sure, happy to Patrick. So I've commented on prior calls. Sometimes you'll see originations up, transaction fees could be flat or slightly up. They're not going to move in total lockstep. It's really going to depend on which deals we lead, which deals we participate in. So there's a number of factors that go into that. You certainly can see transaction fees up strongly versus 1Q. 1Q tends to be a slower quarter seasonally from a transaction fee perspective. But we certainly -- transaction fees are where we would have generally expected them this quarter. So the -- when I spoke last quarter, it really was driven by the timing of when we closed the capital and so the timing of when we closed the capital as opposed to part of that coming in 2Q, part of that slipped to 3Q. And so what you're seeing is the 3Q guidance I gave, I feel very good about. The 4Q guidance is anticipating a certain level of fundraising that we just -- we can't predict sitting here today. But the 3Q numbers, I feel very comfortable providing. So we don't take divisions down to the FRE level, Craig. But I can certainly tell you that the revenue contribution to the direct lending business from Wellfleet was in the mid to upper single-digit millions. And yes, that you can anticipate that as a run rate going forward, we will grow that business. So certainly, we'll look to add to that over the coming quarters as we continue to launch CLOs, but that's a good base to start with. So we had a -- we've done a July 1 and August 1 close. Those numbers have trended down a little bit, not dramatically, but they have trended down a little bit, which would be in line with our expectations. And maybe I would argue better than what we've been seeing in the industry. Very well, thank you. Catch-up fees were $12.8 million."

            "content": "Great. Thanks so much, Doug. I'd like to pick up where Doug left off in his earlier comments about the terrific opportunities we're seeing in our direct lending business. We've been able to generate strong growth in that business through very constructive market environments, but these choppy markets are even more advantageous for us to deploy capital and are especially where direct lending strategies shine. As a scaled player in direct lending with patient permanent capital, we are well positioned to provide much-needed capital solutions at a time when liquidity is scarce and our market-leading position in tech lending has served us well. We continue to lead a number of large finances for large software firms and attractive spreads and low loan to values. Our continued capital formation puts us in a position to lead the biggest deals happening in the market today such as Zendesk and Anaplan.  So to use a recent example, we were recently named the admin agent on the senior credit facilities for Helman Improvement and Premier's acquisition of Zendesk, a scaled and fast-growing market leader in the customer support service market for midsize and enterprise customers. Zendesk's revenue is highly recurring with attractive retention metrics driven by a strong value proposition and expansion within its existing customer base, precisely the type of characteristics we look for when we've enhanced a software company. So for the first half of the year, we looked at nearly 50 deals with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion, exceeding the over 40 investments of that size, we evaluated in all of 2021 for the full year. Our pipeline remains very robust as sponsors sit on meaningful dry powder and continue to find attractive opportunities. We're also having conversations with various non-sponsored private companies looking for financing solutions. This is an excellent market with favorable supply-demand characteristics for us. For the second quarter, as you can see on Slide 13 of the earnings release, gross originations of $7.6 billion were up nearly 50% year-over-year and over 55% quarter-over-quarter. For the last 12 months, gross originations in direct lending have been $28.9 billion, more than double what we originated in the prior 12-month period. Although we expect capital markets activity will likely remain under pressure in the near term, we're cautiously optimistic that the back half of this year will remain quite active for our direct lending strategy. Credit quality across our direct lending portfolio remained very strong, and we are proud to say we have not had a single new nonaccrual for default in the quarter.  Our annualized net realized losses have remained at approximately 5 basis points since inception. And we continue to focus on downside protection, with a weighted average loan to value in the low 40s across our direct lending portfolio and in the low 30s across our tech portfolio. The interest coverage ratio across direct lending is roughly 3.3 times, we expect that even with a further 200 basis point rating, interest coverage will remain above 2.5 times. So our portfolio is very helpful. So far, we have seen great resiliency in the ability for our portfolio of companies we finance fast costs along to their other customers, protecting their businesses for margin compression. Now turning to performance for the 12 months, the direct lending portfolio appreciated 8% and for the second quarter, while March were negative due to spread widening on how we value our existing loans as a result, our portfolio continued to fundamentally perform very well. Let me take a second and comment on how we think about mark-to-market. You've heard me say this before, but it does bear repeating. While we care very deeply about the performance of our products, and it very much matters to us and the investors and our funds for this particular audience, performance and in particular, unrealized mark-to-market is not really impactful to our shareholders. As you saw during the quarter, there was deminimis impact on our management fees as a result of marks, as evidenced by the management fee growth in direct lending during a period in which public credit markets traded off significantly. Said another way, what we ultimately care about is good credit call and that we get paid back on our investments, and everything in between is simply noise. Unrealized marks from changes in spreads do not impact the overall performance of our investments or our dividends to our investors.  Now moving on to fundraising, we raised $3 billion direct lending strategies during the second quarter, of which wealth constituted $1.9 billion. This incorporates $500 million close for our new tech income fund and ongoing clauses for our core income fund. Furthermore, we've experienced very limited tenders in our core income fund. During the second quarter, investors requested tenders for a deminimis $28 million which compares to $10 billion of AUM in this fund. Subsequent to the end of second quarter, we closed an additional $2 billion across direct lending and more broadly, we continued to expand the distribution for all of our direct lending products flow. Now moving on to our real estate business. As we spoke about at Investor Day, we believe we are in an attractive investment environment and continue to see tailwinds for net lease as corporate borrowing costs continue to increase. As we stand here today, we have roughly $1.5 billion in transaction volume under letter of intent or contract close and a near-term pipeline of more than $25 billion of potential loss. As of today, we have invested over 55% of the equity in our fifth closed-end fund, putting us on track to launch our real estate Fund VI later this year. The pipeline for sale leasebacks is very robust, and the volatility of the markets continues to create opportunities. We've recently picked up approximately $900 million of broken deal flow at an average cap rate that is meaningfully better than that of the prior potential market [ph] but we expect to continue capitalizing on similar opportunities in a challenging financing market.  In addition, we launched our latest open-ended product, Net Lease Trust. We're currently in one large wirehouse with this product today, with an expectation to have the first close in the third quarter, and we will continue expanding. We are very excited about this net lease strategy generally and believe we have a very differentiated approach. Investors in this strategy will be able to access the advantages of the net lease structure, which targets an attractive 7% plus yield, primarily investment-grade counterparties with beneficial tax attributes, and we think this compares favorably to other strategies currently out there. You've heard us say this multiple times now, but I think it bears repeat; income generation, inflation litigation, and downside protection are what investors are looking for in markets such as these, and our net lease strategy provides just that. Since our real estate strategies inception, we have never had a tenant miss a single rent payment, go bankrupt or default on a lease, and we've generated a net IRR of 26% on average across our fully realized closed-end funds and gross appreciation across our real estate portfolio of 6.7% for the second quarter alone, and 30.4% for the last 12 months. These are strong risk-adjusted returns for the underlying credit profile of these portfolios. As you can tell, we are quite excited about our track record and strategy given the large opportunities that we see. So with that, let me turn it to Michael to discuss GP Capital Solutions. Great. Thanks, Glenn. First of all, definitely I want to echo your comment. I think we're great at it. So here's what's happening, we're seeing a continued market share evolution. Look, at the end of the day, there's a very big marketplace out there for capital solutions. And the direct lending is a minority portion of it and will be a minority portion of it probably for a very long time. That said, there's $2 trillion of dry powder in the hands of private equity firms. And just assuming one turn of leverage, that's $2 trillion of incremental demand for financings, plus you got to refinance the trillions of dollars of financing that's already in place in the market. So from the point of view of where Blue Owl sits, it's a nearly limitless sort of white space, so to speak. And what's happening for us in particular, and as you know, it's not for us alone, the market in total for direct lending, has been growing, and it's been growing for, I think, a few reasons. One, of course, has been the expansion of the depth of the pools of capital we have to offer. So our relevance to the ever larger financing opportunities has changed over the last five years. And that you can see in those same calculations, that 50 deals over $1 billion that we looked at, you go back to, say 2016, there were zero of that scale that were relevant to -- that have been done in direct lending. So it is an evolution of the depths of capital pools.  It's also very importantly, I think most importantly, that we've been able to prove that the model for direct lending, when we started Blue Owl, we really had a view that what we wanted to take was a direct lending business whose legacy had been a lender of last resort, for the companies that sort of couldn't get financed elsewhere and turn it into the lender of first choice for the best companies and the best sponsors. And that meant creating the value proposition. And today, what we call the 3P is, right, predictability, privacy and partnership. People, I think, call them, in many cases, the very best firms, the best companies to say, look, I understand we pay more spread. I understand it's a tougher document, but I really appreciate the value proposition that comes with it. And so today, this year, think about this, we at Blue Owl have led Anaplan, $10 billion plus take private, was announced that we're leading Zendesk, another $10 billion plus take private. Yesterday, you may have seen that Tomarabo announced Ping, we're the lead in financing the Ping take private. So I think you've just seen this model and its value proposition to these world-class companies, world-class sponsor to prove out. Thanks for the question. And you hit on a really important point, which is to do this business well it is a very people-intensive business. That is to say it's a very intensive work exercise, right. We have to do a tremendous amount of investing in origination to find the thousands and thousands of opportunities that we look at to do the very small number we ultimately do. Deep due diligence, extensive work on credit agreements, which as we've said before, to sound arcane is really important part of what we do in terms of protecting capital. So this is a business that we've had to invest very heavily in building the team. Now we have done that. We have one of the largest dedicated teams in the world to do this, we have coming up on 100 people, professionals doing direct lending and that's really what we live and breathe. So I think we're very, very well staffed to support the level of activities we have. We'll always be continuing to look to build our team and make sure we have the best team on the field, and we're always being proactive and finding the best opportunities. But we look back to our activity levels in 4Q last year, look at this quarter, we're in very good shape to support the kind of level of activity that we're talking about and seeing. So the pace of activity in those conversations has picked up, as you've said. Now pace of activity mean the pace of available opportunities and conversations available to have. We're going to continue to be extremely selective. Remember, in Oak Street, what we had and have is just a market leader, extraordinary risk-return results, great team, a great leader in Mark Zar. So it's a great culture fit as a result and we won't need all of that to make an acquisition. Well, similarly, not as large, of course and strategic but again, a fantastic team, a great culture fit and a great complement to our core business. So we're in the picks and shovels business. We're in the capital solutions business and so you should, I think, continue to think about us looking for places where we can adopt other solutions that are adjacent. We can be another go-to source of capital, particularly for this private markets ecosystem.  So we have a foothold in real estate today and a very strong one at that. It's obviously a very large space that we can continue to explore. We are a very U.S. centric business collectively today. Obviously, we're -- we could explore things outside the U.S. So I think you'll continue to see us be very engaged. In a world where the IPOs managers is no longer a particularly practical idea for most today, I think we will continue to see people who are saying, I see an opportunity to grow, I like the benefits of being part of a larger platform, and we're going to continue to engage with those folks and selectively hopefully add to the platform. Thank you Brian. I think and obviously, time will tell, I think the pie will continue to grow because there's a great value proposition. Really, at the end of the day, again, we're clear. We -- our loans -- we charge more, and there's no doubt that our documents are more restrictive and rigorous, but we offer people absolute certainty on their capital. They're going to have the money at the time and place they want it on the terms that they want it, that predictability. Private equity, and you want to be able to take a long-term view to build these businesses. We're the match to that. We're the private credit. We bring the whole system together and take a view of where you want to be three years from now to have a bigger, better business, and partnership. When things like the pandemic hit or current uncertainties in the world arise today, knowing you can speak to your partner, the person who owns in our case, on average, lend through kind of the low 40% value of an enterprise we are going to call that person saying let's talk about the future and getting from here to there, that's worth it.  And so what I think we're seeing is two things happening in today's market, the continued overall secular trend, which is, hey, that's a great value proposition. And once people try it, many people, great sponsors, great companies, private businesses alike, return to it, saying that was a really good experience. I'm going to do that again. So that becomes like a step function increase in the marketplace that we work with. Then there's another thing happening today that we should keep an eye on, which is, look, there is basically no meaningful syndicated market. So today, if you want to make a large acquisition, really direct lending is the primary opportunity, the primary option. So there's certainly also a bit of a cyclical element right now in terms of available opportunities to direct lending. So it's a combination of both that we're seeing, but the secular trend is the more powerful one. And I think as long as we continue to develop pools of capital and deliver the value proposition, that should continue. I will say that one of the -- the greater challenge from where we sit and I think where the market will sit is we just don't have enough capital to meet the need. We don't have enough capital to make the loans that, frankly, today, we deem very attractive. We're seeing some of the best risk return opportunities we've seen since inception. And we don't have the capital to meet it and nor does the industry for that matter. So the bigger challenge, I think, gets down to capital allocators deciding and recognizing the opportunity here to have a safe floating rate experience, which is what we offer and delivering the capital so that we can in turn deliver it through our platforms to these great companies. I think people should be anxious about markets, but not just now. I mean that is to say our business in direct lending is built for exactly this environment. So we performed very well during strong times as we have for the past many years, but our -- we really shine in times like this, this is what we're built for, senior secured loans against very large companies, very high-quality, world-class businesses with world-class sponsors, floating rate exposure. So this is really the market we're built for. So I wouldn't say that anxiety is misplaced, it's a very uncertain world out there. I would say probably investors should be kind of anxious but because you're anxious is the reason you go to direct lending, you say, I want to be senior secured I want to be at the top of the capital structure. I want to be protected from interest rate changes. And I want to do that with people that do vigorous underwriting, deeply in origination, work with the best sponsors and work with the best company. So I think our particular position in the market for specifically because that's really our strike zone, which are the best companies best sponsors, that's really our strike zone. That's a particularly strong place to be. Really important point to note for this audience is what we all care tremendously about the performance of our portfolio and presumably, I think shows our since assumption performance was 5 basis points annualized loss rates. Remember, for the shareholders, people on this call it doesn't matter really at all. That is to say we are an entirely fee-based business, right. 100% of our revenues are fee based. So unlike anybody else in the marketplace where there's carry heavily embedded in their alt structures, we don't have that carry component, we're fee-based. So we care a lot about credit quality, and we're -- fair to say one of the best at it. But for you all as shareholders, to be clear, it actually doesn't affect the results."

            "name": "Douglas I. Ostrover",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 7 of our earnings presentation, we reported yet another strong quarter of results for Blue Owl with AUM up 91%, management fees up 63%, and FRE up 52%, all from the second quarter of last year. We continue to experience growth across all verticals, underpinned by secular tailwinds, demand for our differentiated strategies, and expansion of Blue Owl's distribution platforms globally. And our significant permanent capital base accounting for 92% of our management fees in conjunction with our 100% FRE based earnings create resiliency and stability in our financial profile. Many of you were either in the audience or listening via webcast, when we had our Investor Day a couple of months ago. And when I think back on the key messages from that day, the business that you heard us describe is one that really stands out during markets like the one we're seeing now. And for those of you that weren't able to tune in for Investor Day, we talked about three key milestones for our business; raising $50 billion of fee-paying AUM across 2022 and 2023, achieving after-tax DE of $1 billion in 2023, and paying $1 dividend per share in 2025. We have always said we're striving to build a different type of alternative asset manager. We want to give you growth that is better than our peers, but with downside protection and absent the volatility of carried interest running through our financials. I think you've seen that clearly shown in our results this quarter, and I expect that to play out even more next quarter. So we look forward to continuing to demonstrate the strength of our differentiated model. Our view has always been that investors should appreciate and ascribe higher value to stable, steady and growing management fee streams. And we are now getting the chance to display that stability against a volatile and challenging market backdrop for our peers.  With that in mind, let me first offer some commentary on the broader market environment and Blue Owl's positioning before I cover our second quarter results. In a continuation of the trends we saw during the first quarter, inflation, interest rates and global GDP growth have remained in the spotlight, driving ongoing public markets volatility. This is exactly the type of environment where we are able to differentiate our business model and the value of our strategies. At the Blue Owl level, we have patient and permanent capital and resilient management fees, providing underlying support to our existing earnings profile even as we continue to grow, the layer cake analogy, and we anticipate a net positive impact to earnings as rates rise, particularly for our direct lending business, where Part 1 fees benefit from higher rates. At the strategy level, that same permanent capital allows us to provide flexible certain financing solutions to sponsors, corporations, and alternative asset managers during a time when liquidity is scarce and public markets are closed are much more expensive than they used to be. And for the investors in our strategies, our products offer attractive qualities in volatile uncertain markets, income generation, downside protection, and structural inflation hedges. All this to say, we feel very well positioned to navigate the current market environment. Pipelines remain robust across the business as we continue to see market share come our way in direct lending despite lower industry M&A volumes and across our businesses. We believe our scale and capital base create meaningful competitive advantages. This is one of the most favorable environments we've seen for direct lending since our inception seven years ago. and we fully intend to capture the attractive risk-adjusted opportunities we're seeing.  Moving on to our second quarter results, we continue to demonstrate steady and robust growth, with management fees growing 14% quarter-over-quarter and 63% year-over-year. Fundraising for the quarter was well diversified with over $7 billion of capital raised across strategies from both institutional and private wealth investors. Keep in mind, that's up from $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. That brings our last 12-month equity capital raised to $17.3 billion for organic growth of 28%. As we mentioned during our recent Investor Day, we launched our new wire house distributed tech lending product, ORTIC during the second quarter, closing on over $700 million through August 1st, primarily driven by one wirehouse in one geography and we are in the process of expanding the distribution for that product substantially over the coming quarters. This is in addition to the multiple closings we've had for our other tech lending BDC, ORTF2, which has now exceeded $3 billion of equity and which remains in the market and we continue to see good traction for a diversified lending strategy as well. Through August 1st, we have raised an additional $2 billion across direct lending of which private wealth constituted over half.  In GP Solutions, we raised $3 billion for Dow Fund V during the quarter and through August 1st, we've raised the subsequent $200 million to take the fund to approximately $10 billion. We anticipate wrapping up fundraising later this year which we expect will bring the fund to over $10.5 billion. And in real estate, we expect the second half of the year to be very active as we come to market with new products and next vintages of existing clients. What we hear often from our investors is that the defensive nature of our strategies and their focus on income generation and principal preservation are highly desirable during good markets, but they stand out even more during challenging environments. And we've been active in deployment across all of our strategies, moving us closer to the next big fund raise for each of those strategies. Looking ahead, the key messages that we've highlighted over the past year and most recently at Investor Day, should continue to resound in today's market. We see meaningful runway to raise capital across institutional and wealth channels and in our view, we have the right strategies, the right people, and deep investment expertise in place to invest that capital well. Permanent capital remains the cornerstone of our business, creating competitive advantages and supporting growth, and with each successive dollar of new assets raised we will continue to add new layers to Blue Owl's earnings power. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc to give you an update on our direct lending and real estate businesses. Marc? Why don't I -- good morning Alex, why don't I have Alan start on the $2 billion direct lending piece, and then I can address retail. And then let me just start by saying in fund raising this quarter, we were really pleased. It was a great quarter. We raised $7.2 billion. I think, as Alan mentioned, $3.6 billion of that came from wealth, and that's versus $2.2 billion in the first quarter. And I think I have this number right, it's about $1.3 billion has been raised from wealth, quarter-to-date. So continue to do well, definitely seeing a little bit of weakness. We're reiterating our $50 billion of fundraising goal for the next 2022 and 2023. We mentioned that our tenders have been deminimis, just $28 million in the second quarter out of $10 billion. And so over the intermediate and longer term, our views haven't changed. We're confident in our ability to continue to raise capital from wealth. And I think the products we're offering in the channel have attributes that really resonate, lots of income generation, downside protection, positive leverage to rising rates, especially in direct lending. I think at our last call, we talked about the wealth channel and how allocations thoughts remain very low. In Investor Day, you'll remember, we put up a number that we thought the wealth channel would control $220 trillion by 2025, and that an incremental 20% of that could move into the alternative market, that's $40 trillion to $50 trillion. So when we talk about wealth, our enthusiasm hasn't waned at all. In fact, we're more excited than ever. We have spent a lot of time building our brand. Our distribution now is truly global as good as anyone in the market. You know we've been at this since the day we launched approximately seven years. So I think we're in a really unique position to not only continue to maintain market share but to grow market share in that channel for the next number of years. Just to reiterate, super excited about it and hopefully, Marc mentioned this, you'll start to see that as we roll out our nontraded REIT. Yes. I'll just make one quick comment. At the end of the day, we want to give our investors liquidity. They want it. We want to give it to them. But we're all in agreement that we want to do it at a time where we feel really good that when we listed, it will trade well. And we're certainly not in that environment today. There's virtually no IPOs. So as you think about the right environment, think about an environment where it's a fairly robust environment to get IPOs done. And I think we will be one of the firms that list and get a good reception, because it is, as Alan mentioned, it's a mature portfolio doing well. And I think when the time is right, I think our marketplace will find it interesting. Thank you Patrick. Thanks Craig, doing great. Yes. This is Doug. Thanks for the question. Look, since the Dial merger, we've really ramped up our global distribution. One of the things we got really excited about when we merged with Dial then with Oak Street was there was very little overlap between our LP base. In fact, shockingly like 2% to 3%. And so we are in the very early stages of cross-selling one another's products to each of these LPs. And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but we are having really good success. To answer your question, I'd say we're probably 85% of the way there. There's one or two jurisdictions that will probably add a few people. But from a cost standpoint, I think it's a deminimis cost and I don't think it will have any impact on the financials. Thank you Ken. And Chris, I want you to know all of us in the room are really grateful that you asked a question about the GP Solutions business because as Michael said, I think there was some skepticism in the market of us hitting our target. We've exceeded it handily, and that fund is doing really well. The investors are thrilled and as you alluded to, I think it's setting us up for a really successful Fund VI sometime in the not-too-distant future. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Hopefully, you got a sense that our business continues to have really good momentum. Just to reiterate one thing we talked about at Investor Day, we put up a slide at the end with three words: stability, predictability and growth. And I think what this quarter demonstrated is that we have a unique model. We have more permanent capital than any of our peers with best-in-class growth. So we're excited for what lays ahead. We're grateful for everyone's support, and I hope everyone enjoys the rest of the summer. And hopefully, we'll have a chance to see all of you soon. Thanks again."

            "content": "Thank you, Marc. We continue to see a very constructive fundraising and investing environment for our GP Capital Solutions business, particularly given our positioning as an attractive and scaled source of capital for growing private managers. Continued growth across the alternative asset manager space not only drives our investable opportunity set as more firms seek growth equity, but it also drives cash flow from our partner managers as they continue to raise and deploy capital. As Doug mentioned earlier, during the second quarter, we closed on roughly $3 billion of new commitments for Dial Fund V, bringing total commitments to $9.8 billion. So far in the third quarter, we've raised an additional $200 million taking the fund to $10 billion. We are excited about the strong momentum and anticipating wrapping up fundraising later this year, which we expect will bring the fund to over $10.5 billion, exceeding the $9 billion we had on the cover. At $10.5 billion, the size of Fund V will be a record in the GP stakes industry and nearly twice as large as the next competitor. This puts us in a position to continue deploying capital into large firms with leading track records. As we've highlighted at our Investor Day, our market share of deals above $600 million in check size has been approximately 88%. We remained active on the capital deployment front as well, adding two positions in leading firms that are new partner managers as well as three commitments to firms we have funded previously. As you can see on Slide 16 of the earnings presentation, this brings total commitments for Dial V to $7.4 billion. Having already surpassed Fund V's target size by $1 billion as of August 1st and with additional capital expected to close this year, we anticipate the launch of Fund VI towards the end of 2023 with fees turning on in 2024.  Performance across the Dial funds remained strong with gross IRR of 31% for Fund III and 112% for Fund IV. Looking ahead, we're very optimistic about what the next 12 months holds for the GP Capital Solutions business. Not only is Dial well positioned within a very small set of firms that have scale and capability to provide growth capital to fund these managers, but we continue to partner with managers who are the greatest beneficiaries of flows to alternatives and GP consolidation. Overall, we see ample opportunities to take advantage of this dislocation in the current market environment. With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results. Yes, well thanks for the question. As we look at the business for GP Solutions, Q2 and into Q3 is really highlighting the strategic position of our business and the Dial funds. We are seeing increased demand from investors so our fund size, we were able to increase. We're also seeing a really strong and building pipeline of continued deals with the biggest and what we believe to be the best players in this space. So we are, at the same time, raising a larger fund but we're deploying it in real time. So it means that we'll be back out on the road in calendar 2023. We'll have plenty of dry powder to get us into the beginning of 2023, but we'll want to make sure that Fund VI, that handoff is ready at some point in that calendar year, and we expect the fees to turn on towards the end of the year or very beginning of the following. But it's important for us to have ample capital but our investors like to see some of the portfolio names and the strength of it as we go, which is why having this market-leading position, we believe we have partners like CBC and Veritas and HIG and Dragonair and many, many others like it, is such a strong position to market from. So I hope that answered your question, but really proud of the quarter and the way we were able to put the Fund V finishing touches on and then start setting our sights on Fund VI. Thank you Chris."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Blue Owl First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]  Ann Dai, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nAnn Dai: Thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Douglas Ostrover, our Chief Executive Officer; Marc Lipschultz and Michael Rees, our Co-President; and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company\u2019s control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in Blue Owl Capital\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We\u2019d also like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website at blueowl.com. This morning we issued our financial results for the first quarter of 2022 and reported fee related earnings or FEE of $0.12 per share, and distributable earnings or DE of $0.11 per share. We also declared dividend of $0.10 per share payable on May 27 to shareholders of record as of May 20. During the call today, we\u2019ll be referring to the earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning. So please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Doug.\nDouglas Ostrover: Thank you, Ann. And good morning, everyone. As you see captured on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation, we reported another quarter of strong results for Blue Owl with AUM up 76%, private wealth fundraising up 172%, management fees up 51%, and FRE up 56% on a year-over-year basis. Pro forma for the Wellfleet acquisition, which closed on April 1, AUM, would have been approximately $109 billion. Originations for the quarter more than doubled versus a year ago, and private wealth fundraising reaching $2.2 billion. And with permanent capital driving 95% of our management fees and an earning stream consisting of stable and growing fee-related earnings Blue Owl\u2019s financial profile stood in stark contrast to a volatile public equity and debt market backdrop during the first quarter. Our strategies, focused on income generation and downside protection, continued to perform well. Investment pipelines across the platform have been robust, and fundraising for the quarter was strong, but more importantly, as we look ahead, there are some meaningful fundraising initiatives starting to bear fruit which I will highlight in more detail in a few minutes. First, let me start with some commentary on the broader market environment, which has been top of mind for shareholders. Over the past quarter, we have witnessed volatility and dispersion in the public markets resulting from high and persistent inflation, a shifting interest rate environment, geopolitical events, and ongoing impact from COVID globally. These factors unsurprisingly created some near-term headwinds to industry-wide M&A and capital markets activity as investors paused to react to updated information, market expectations and a changing investment landscape. Given our scale and patient permanent capital, Blue Owl has been a beneficiary of this market volatility as an increasing number of sponsors and private companies have looked to direct lending for flexible and dependable financing. We are having dialogues on larger deals than we\u2019ve ever seen. And in particular, this has been a very robust environment for our tech lending strategy. And the increasing number of public to private transactions have driven incremental market share towards direct lenders who can offer certainty of execution through what can be a lengthy process. For our GP Solutions business, the pipeline for investment has only strengthened as alternative asset managers evaluate the options they have for liquidity and growth capital in today\u2019s market. And the opportunity for alternative asset managers to put dry powder to work has improved, pulling forward deployment activity and setting firms up for the next round of fundraising. In real estate, rising corporate borrowing costs should drive incremental demand for our net lease solutions. So in aggregate, we\u2019re seeing positive impacts to the investment landscape across Blue Owl as a result of the current market environment. And with regards to the rising interest rate environment, as we discussed last quarter, we anticipate a net positive impact across the platform. We expect direct lending to be a beneficiary of rising rates as investor demand increases for senior secured floating rate assets, focused on downside protection. And over time, the effective rising rates would be positive for the net interest income of our loan portfolios, which Alan will touch on shortly. For GP Solutions, market volatility should drive demand for products managed by large diversified managers benefiting the types of firms Dyal has typically taken stakes in. With respect to our real estate business, we believe there will continue to be strong demand for real estate strategies with long-term contractual income that are positively correlated to inflation and backed by investment-grade tenants. Moving on to our first quarter results. We continue to demonstrate steady robust growth, hallmarks of the Blue Owl business model as a result of our permanent capital and FRE-centric earnings. Since we don\u2019t have the volatility of carried interest running through our revenue, we just continue to add to the layer cake of earnings through new capital raised and deployed. Fundraising for the quarter was well diversified, with nearly $4 billion of equity capital raised primarily from our diversified lending, technology lending and GP minority stake strategies, bringing our last 12 month equity capital raise to $11.3 billion. And for the second quarter to-date, we\u2019re up to a great start, raising $2.8 billion across the platform. In direct lending, we have raised an additional $2.2 billion subsequent to quarter-end across institutional and wealth channels. As we have spoken about in prior quarters, we anticipate that tech lending will be one of the fastest-growing parts of our business over the next few years as our strong performance and exceptional credit quality in that strategy resonates with a wide spectrum of investors. As it relates to our growing private wealth distribution, which we\u2019ve also spoken about frequently as an important focus for Blue Owl, we continue to make very good progress in expanding our platform across products and geographies. $2.2 billion of the capital we raised in the first quarter or over half of the total was driven by private wealth. This is over 4x the amount we raised through wealth in the second quarter of 2021, less than a year ago. We are generating over 9% annualized organic growth just from our current private wealth flows, which are permanent capital and which we think we can grow meaningfully over time. And this doesn\u2019t take into account any institutional fundraising, new products that we plan to introduce to the market or continued expansion of our wealth distribution platform globally. As of May 2, we raised a further $2.1 billion from private wealth across direct lending, GP Solutions and real estate in the second quarter. As you\u2019ve heard from us before, and will continue to hear going forward, we are very excited about the opportunity ahead in private wealth and look forward to sharing more developments at Investor Day on May 20. Looking forward, as I think about the key elements of our growth over the next few years, I truly believe that each of our businesses has significant growth ahead. We see meaningful runway to raise capital across institutional and wealth channels as investors look for income, inflation-hedge solutions and downside protection in an uncertain market environment. Each of our businesses has generated scale and offers real competitive advantages that translate into differentiated investment performance. And the returns have resonated with our investors. Today, we have multiple products raising capital on various platforms globally in private wealth. Dyal V fundraising continues, and we are well on our way to fully deploying that fund and being back in the market for Fund VI. We also have, and will have a number of funds raising capital from institutional investors across direct lending and real estate over the course of the year. Later this month at our Investor Day, we plan to lay out some key growth goals and get into greater detail on the investment and fundraising landscape that we see for each of our businesses. We hope to see all of you there in person or on the webcast and look forward to spending some time highlighting our strategic vision and the substantial growth we see ahead. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to mark, to give you an update on our direct lending and real estate businesses. Mark?\nMarc Lipschultz: Thanks, Doug. As you can see on Slide 16, we continue to expand our direct lending business with gross originations of $4.9 billion, more than double what we originated in the first quarter of 2021. Industry-wide the first quarter was a seasonally lighter quarter for M&A, and was also affected by market volatility. As Doug alluded to in his remarks, we continue to expand our market share, driven by the predictability, privacy and partnership that we offer to borrowers. We\u2019re also seeing larger deals come to the direct lending space, which we are very well-positioned to address given the scale of Blue Owl\u2019s platform and capital base. For context, last year we evaluated over 40 investments with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion and signed or closed on roughly half of them. Just in the first quarter of 2022 we sourced over 20 investments with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion and committed to roughly half of them. And of those greater than 20 opportunities, 5 had facilities sizes in excess of $2.5 billion. We expect some of these to close during the second quarter. For the last 12 months, gross originations and direct lending have been $26.4 billion or 3x what we originated in the prior 12-month period. And we continue to see an extremely active pipeline, setting ourselves up for a robust quarter in 2Q. Performance remains strong, with growth and net appreciation of the direct lending products of approximately 1% and 0.2% for the first quarter respectively, and 14.1% and 9.7% respectively for the last 12 months. And we\u2019ve continued to focus on downside protection with a weighted average loan-to-value in the low 40s across direct lending portfolios. Credit quality remains very robust, with annualized net realized losses of approximately 5 basis points since inception. We raised $1.9 billion in direct lending strategies during the first quarter, of which retail constituted $1.4 billion, primarily for our Core Income Fund, one of our diversified lending BDCs. Also contributing to the fundraising during the first quarter were closes in tech lending. As of May 2, we raised a further $2.2 billion across direct lending in the second quarter so far. Also on April 1 we announced the closing of our Wellfleet acquisition, which will add almost $7 billion of AUM to our second quarter numbers. Our direct lending business continues to broaden in size and scope, and we remain optimistic about the growth opportunities we see ahead, supported by robust demand from both retail and institutional investors. Now moving on to our real estate business. We continue to a robust opportunity set with roughly $2 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract to close and a near-term pipeline of more than $20 billion of potential volume. As of today, we\u2019ve invested over half of the equity in our fifth closed-end fund, bringing us closer to launching our real estate fund 6. As Doug mentioned in his remarks, our real estate strategy should benefit from investor demand for inflation-protected cash flows backed by investment-grade and credit-worthy tenants. And our investment opportunity set continues to improve as corporate borrowing costs increase. Contractual rent escalations are structured into all of our triple net leases. And 100% of all operating expenses, including cost increases are borne by the tenant, which further limits the strategies from any adverse effects of inflation. Since inception, we have never had a tenant miss a rent payment, go bankrupt or default on a lease. And we\u2019ve generated a net IRR of 26% on average across our fully realized closed-end funds. And gross and net appreciation across our real estate portfolio of 5.7% and 5% respectively for the first quarter and 36% and 32.1% respectively for the last 12 months. These are remarkable risk-adjusted returns for the underlying credit profile of these portfolios. As we look ahead, we expect to launch our sixth real estate closed-end fund in the latter half of the year, and continue to accept capital into our open-end fund net lease property fund. We\u2019re also in the process of working on new products that we will look to discuss in greater detail at Investor Day. With that, let me turn it to Michael to discuss GP Solutions.\nMichael Rees: Thank you, Marc. Our GP Capital Solutions business has continued to benefit from the secular tailwinds across the alternative asset manager space as more firms enter our investible opportunity set and as these managers needs for capital continues to expand. Across our partner managers, we continue to see robust fundraising and deployment, particularly as the market sell-off created new and interesting investment opportunities. As of today, we have invested, committed or have an agreement in principle to commit approximately two-thirds of what we expect to raise for Dyal Fund 5. And the pipeline remains strong. Performance remains similarly strong with a gross and net IRR of 32% and 24% respectively for Fund III and 127% and 81% respectively were Fund IV. In addition to the $1 billion raised for Fund V during the first quarter, we have closed on a subsequent $400 million of capital in April, bringing us to $7.2 billion raised for the fund. We remain confident in our prior capital raising expectations for this strategy. Further, we look forward to launching a follow-on vehicle sometime in 2023, as we become more fully committed in this current fund. As we look ahead, we\u2019re very optimistic about what the next year holds for the GP Capital Solutions business, given the constructive trends for growth and the demand we\u2019re experiencing for our strategies. Market volatility and shifts to the status quo will continue to create interesting fundraising and investment opportunities and we will benefit from that environment as the premier capital solution provider to these managers. With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter, and then I\u2019ll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I\u2019ll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation as Ann mentioned. So please feel free to have that available to follow along. Okay, let\u2019s start off by covering our quarterly results. We closed our acquisition of Wellfleet on April 1. So you won\u2019t see those numbers in our results until the second quarter. Our first quarter was another quarter of strong growth for our business. Management fees are up $41.1 million or 19% from last quarter, and up over 50% from the first quarter a year ago when you adjust out catch-up fees for Dyal Fund V. Broken down by divisions, direct lending management fees are up $12.8 million or 11% from last quarter, and up 41% from the first quarter a year ago. GP Capital Solutions\u2019 management fees are up $11.1 million or 12% from last quarter and up 42% from the first quarter a year ago again when you adjust out catch-up fees and Dyal Fund V. And real estate management fees, which began contributing to our results on Jan 1 of this year were $17.2 million. FRE is up 4% from last quarter, and up 56% from the first quarter a year ago. FRE margins are up a little from last quarter as well. Our ratio of compensation as a percentage of revenue came down a little this quarter to 27.5%. I expect for 2022 we will be in the lower half of the range that we\u2019ve previously guided to, which was 25% to 30%. And we announced a dividend of $0.10 cents per share for the first quarter. All of this is in line with our expectations in what I noted on our earnings call last quarter. We have started off the year in making good progress towards reaching $1.3 billion of revenues for 2022, which would be a 45% growth rate year-over-year and an FRE margin of 60-plus percent for 2022. As it relates to our AUM metrics, on Slide 13, we reported AUM of $102 billion, repaying AUM of $65.6 billion and total permanent capital of $85.6 billion. AUM not yet paying fees was $7.7 billion as of March 31. As Doug mentioned, inclusive of the Wellfleet acquisition, our AUM would be approximately $109 billion. AUM grew $7.5 billion to $102 billion, an 8% increase from last quarter and a 76% increase from the first quarter a year ago, driven primarily by deployment of capital and debt raised in direct lending, the addition of our real estate division and capital raising across the firm. Fee-paying AUM grew $4.1 billion to $65.6 billion, a 7% increase from last quarter, and a 64% increase from the first quarter a year ago, driven primarily by deployment in direct lending, the addition of our real estate division and capital raising across the firm. Permanent capital grew $6.8 billion to $85.6 billion, a 9% increase from last quarter and a 61% increase from the first quarter a year ago, driven primarily by deployment in direct lending, the addition of our real estate division and capital raising across the firm. AUM not yet paying fees was $7.7 billion, including $5.4 billion in direct lending, $0.7 billion in GP Capital Solutions and $1.6 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling approximately $105 million, primarily upon deployment for direct lending and real estate. As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, if our tech BDC were to go public, we expect that could be another incremental $65 million of annual management fees due to the fee step-ups. With the launch of our new tech lending BDC, ORTF II and combined with ORCC III, upon the listing of all 3 of these BDCs, we expect that could be a total incremental $185 million of annual management fees. I plan to get into this more on Investor Day, so please stay tuned for that. As Marc highlighted earlier, we had another strong quarter of deployment in direct lending with gross originations of $4.9 billion and net funded deployment of $3.4 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $26.4 billion with $14.7 billion of net funded deployment. So as it relates to the $5.4 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us less than 2 quarters to fully deploy this based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on Slide 23, we currently have almost $1 billion of liquidity with a very long-dated capital structure. On another note, as Marc touched on, we have raised a significant amount of equity in our direct lending business year-to-date, in particular since quarter end. There are 2 items here I wanted to flag for everyone on this point. The first item, as we continue to fund raise, there will be varying levels of distribution replacement costs associated with different raises for our various BDCs. So to provide more clarity here using the example of raising $1 billion and assuming we pay out $25 million to $30 million in onetime upfront distribution replacement fee expenses on certain equity dollars raised, this will generate over time approximately $50 million of management fees, including Part I fees per year, every year, it\u2019s permitting capital. So just making the point here that for our second quarter of 2022, based on what we\u2019re seeing so far, we expect to show a potentially large nonrecurring expense in our G&A line related to these fundraises and a much smaller amount of incremental management fees for that quarter due to this timing mismatch. I\u2019ll be sure to call this out in my prepared remarks when and as this happens, so it\u2019s visible and transparent to everyone. The second item, more specifically, as it relates to our ORTIC product, just a reminder here that we have a fee waiver in place for this product through October 31 of this year, so we\u2019re not earning management fees on this product for almost all of this year. Full fee start up on November 1. Both of these items were part of the 2022 outlook that I discussed on our last earnings call in February. So to wrap up here, before getting to Q&A, there\u2019s a few last items I want to cover. First, at our Investor Day coming up on May 20, we\u2019ll be talking about a number of different ways in which we believe we can drive shareholder value. One of the areas we identified was the potential to be included in the Russell indices. On April 11 we announced the change to the voting power of our Class A shares, which represents our public float. When we initially looked into this, we believe we had satisfied all of the other required criteria to be included in the Russell indices with this one exception. We did this to open the potential to be included in the newly reconstituted Russell indices at the end of next month. Next, our stock buyback program. During the first quarter, Blue Owl bought back 2 million shares of stock at an average cost of $12.09 per share. Pulling the lens back a little on this topic, starting this year we generally expect to buy back stock that we issue in connection with stock compensation. We\u2019re not trying to get this exactly right on a quarterly basis or even annually, but over the course of time we expect to buy back shares to offset dilution from stock compensation. Finally, Doug touched on inflation and rising rates in his remarks, so I wanted to hit this with everyone. Our business is very well positioned for a rising rate environment. If you look at Slide 17 of our earnings presentation, you will see that our 1Q annualized FRE revenue could increase by 2- to 4-plus percent if rates increase by 200 to 300 basis points. This would all be incremental to anything we have previously discussed. We didn\u2019t include potential rate changes in our forecast, but not included in the 2022 revenue target given in February of $1.3 billion. Summing it all up, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter. We are hitting in all of our key metrics, and we continue to have very exciting growth plans ahead of us, which we feel we are well positioned to execute on. We look forward to seeing everyone later this month at our Investor Day event. Thank you again to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that, operator, can we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler.\nCraig Siegenthaler: This is Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. So Doug, I was actually hoping that you could elaborate on your bullishness on the tech lending backdrop because I\u2019m just thinking if economic conditions moderate, and there\u2019s a period of slower underlying profit growth from the portfolio companies and less investment activity from the private equity industry, which you lend to, I was just curious behind your confidence in the robust growth trajectory in tech.\nMarc Lipschultz: Craig, it\u2019s Marc. I\u2019ll take that one. So I think it\u2019s both our expectations, but it\u2019s also the reality. The activity levels right now, we have never seen more large and high-quality opportunities, and they\u2019re almost entirely in the software space, and we are the market leader in terms of capabilities in that space. So both sitting here now and just to give you a statistic to go with this, again, the preponderance of this being driven by software. If you look at last year, there\u2019s a total of 40 private financings that we saw of $1 billion or greater, again, very heavily driven by software. This first quarter alone, we see over 20 that are $1 billion or greater. And now a new category has entered $2.5 billion or greater. And the reason that matters is not just the size, it does speak to deployment opportunity, but these are incredibly large market-leading global companies. So I couldn\u2019t -- and we\u2019re not trying to comment on whether their growth rates be exactly what the sponsors think better, worse, 20%, 15%, 25%, that\u2019s not what matters to us. It\u2019s the durability and attractiveness of the long-term franchise in our tech portfolio, our tech -- Own Rock Tech I we lend on average in the low 30% level. So if one just took an abstract $5 billion buyout, which is no longer large in the tax sector, that would be $1.5 billion of debt with a $3.5 billion equity check. So our bullishness comes from both the current activity level, which is quite exceptional. Our outlook, which is with all the dry powder, $2 trillion of dry powder in the hands of private equity, again with a particular concentration, heavily tipped towards software and tech that needs to be and will be deployed. Many of the sponsors see this disruption in the market as a moment of opportunity. The time will tell if that\u2019s true or not, but that is clearly the action that\u2019s been undertaken. And that\u2019s leading to some of the best things we\u2019ve seen, frankly. And I guess just add one more, remember, we also have this structured capability in tech. This is our yield-enhanced capability that was really built for this exact environment, which is companies that are great private tech companies that maybe got ahead of themselves on valuations. It doesn\u2019t mean they are deeply valuable. And these are some of our most exciting lowest-risk opportunities where we also get equity upside. So I\u2019m really not trying to overstate it. We feel like now is exactly kind of the pinnacle moment for the tech opportunity.\nDouglas Ostrover: Yes. And I\u2019ll just chime in for 30 seconds. Marc, really hit on all the high points. But I think it\u2019s important to remember, when we talk about technology, we\u2019re talking mostly about enterprise software. We don\u2019t do start-ups. We look for things that have high recurring revenue, very little churn, high predictability of cash flow. And so as we look out across the lending landscape, we actually think these businesses are some, maybe the best things we can lend to. So we\u2019re excited about it, and we\u2019re excited about our position in the market.\nMarc Lipschultz: And I apologize [indiscernible] small comment on that point, which is in our tech lending platform, Owl Rock Tech I, we have since inception still never had a default. We\u2019ve never had a loan in arrears. So the durability, again, isn\u2019t really a case of theory. It\u2019s been the most durable sector in our portfolio and broader than that. But I think there\u2019s a lot to like right now.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And Marc, if we broaden that conversation out to include the whole credit business, all of Owl Rock, and it\u2019s nice to know there was never a default in the tech business. And also, I think you said earlier that realized losses are pretty much very low. But if we move earlier into this -- the credit quality stage, so early stage credit quality like delinquencies, nonaccruals, what you\u2019re seeing with covenants. How does the portfolio look today versus 6 months ago just because economic conditions have moderated a little bit?\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. A couple of things. It\u2019s a great question, of course. So first, let me take one step back and as a Blue Owl matter I think it\u2019s really important for the shareholders. Remember, Blue Owl as a firm, we are essentially 100% fee-driven revenue, management fee-driven revenue. And so we care deeply about the performance of our products. But actually, the question you\u2019re raising doesn\u2019t affect the earnings of Blue Owl. We don\u2019t have carry. So that question is going to be very salient for firms that are carry centric and have a variety of products that go up and down with the answer to a question like that or an equity valuation changes. We don\u2019t, we get paid fees. So for Blue Owl shareholders on this call, the fortunate answer to questions like what happens if credit quality issues tick up or what happens with inflation, the answer doesn\u2019t matter to people on this call. Now it matters to us matters, it matters to all of us when we think about growth of products. So let me still answer your question because of course we care a lot about it as a firm and for our LPs. So credit quality has remained very strong, very robust. We continue to run at extremely low delinquency rates, default rates. I mean, any measure you want to use, we continue to feel extremely good. The portfolio is in robust shape. Across our platform in total, we\u2019re running at loan to values in the low 40s. We refer to 30s for tech. It\u2019s in the low 40s across the whole firm. As we go into this, most of our borrowers are in very strong shape. Remember, we\u2019ve always built at Owl Rock, Blue Owl in particular, a very defensive strategy. That is to say we\u2019ve always erred on the side of low risk, which, to summary you can say hasn\u2019t mattered over the last several years. Well, now it\u2019s going to matter. And we have built into our franchise on, look, we want the best companies with low loan to values and you can give us 50 extra basis points to get us to take impairment risk. That\u2019s just not how we operate. And those differences are going to start to show amongst managers. So here again, let\u2019s go with the statistics, we\u2019re in $56 billion of loans, and we\u2019re running at a 5 basis point realized loss rate and the losses in total associate with $300 million of original notional loans. So of course, a more rocky environment. Of course, that\u2019s an uptick. I don\u2019t think any of invest planning for what amounts to [indiscernible] 0 losses. But portfolio is looking very strong and final statistics as we go into this across the broader portfolio, EBITDA to interest coverage. We\u2019re heading in with an average of 2.7x. So there\u2019s a lot of room in that statistic for both declines in EBITDA, even though these are generally pretty robust businesses that we invest in as well as rising rates off a low floor. So again, we\u2019re not being dismissive. We\u2019re thinking real hard about the volatile environment, but we\u2019re feeling quite good.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein.\nAlex Blostein: So, I wanted to start maybe with a question around real estate. There\u2019s a couple of stats I think, Marc, you mentioned in your prepared remarks. I just wanted to understand them a little better. I think one of the things you mentioned was around a $20 billion [indiscernible]. I want to say it was for deployment, but it wasn\u2019t 100% clear. So can you maybe contextualize that a little bit more? And maybe taking a step back, how are you guys thinking about prospects for real estate platform over the next 12 to 18 months, given your comments around the new fund raise and the opportunities seen in retail.\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. Very happy to, Alex. Thank you. So first off, the $20 billion really refer to sort of pipeline. So it really speaks, I mean, it has to flow through, of course, like in every investment business, we end up doing a very small portion of the things we look at and consider. But really the point of the statistic is it remains a very, very robust opportunity set much, much larger than our target deployment levels. So book-to-bill, so to speak, not quite book, but the opportunity set is very robust as we sit here. So that was really the purpose of that statistic, remains very strong compared to historical standards. As to the outlook to your very good point, so there\u2019s a few forces at work. By and large, this environment is quite appealing for our real estate business. It\u2019s appealing because as cost of capital within the corporate structure rises, then of course our triple net lease solutions may in many cases, look more competitive to what, I guess, we might have thought of before as low, maybe kind of oddly low borrowing costs for strong corporate borrowers back last year, last quarter for that matter. So as those costs come up, I think our solutions actually look more competitive, number one. Number two, in a more volatile environment, people obviously look for other ways to finance outside of what might be just the obvious, okay, well, I\u2019ll go issue a bond, I\u2019ll just go borrow from a bank. And so we offer these structured solutions that for those who have real estate assets, they could tap into. So we look at the backdrop as quite positive for the point of deployment. And from the point of view of what that means, though, for the quality of the assets and the performance, here is the beauty of it. First off, since inception of Oak Street we were very excited about our credit performance of 5 basis points realized loss. In Oak Street, we\u2019ve never had a single rent payment missed, a single rent payment missed, let alone a default. I mean that durability is, I would say, pretty extraordinary. And so what we like about this composition is more people are looking for creative solutions, cost of capital are up, so that gives more room for us to put our solutions in place. And then the durability of having both the asset and the corporate counterparty on a 15-, 20-year net lease feels in a volatile environment to a true flight to safety.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Great. The other question that I had, and this is probably for you, just wanted to dig in a little bit more into the kind of these placement fee structures and really just kind of trying to understand if we\u2019re going to be in this pretty robust retail fundraising environment, are these placement fees going to be fairly then recurring and sizable for the next sort of several quarters? Or is it more a function of once you get on to a certain platform, there\u2019s a larger upfront cost that you pay and then it kind of goes down a bit. But help me just kind of understand the distribution in place in fee cost that I guess you guys are going to start calling out in future quarters?\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. Thanks, Alex. The lumpiest ones or the larger upfront ones are really on our private to public BDC raises. And we\u2019ve had this a couple of times in the past over the last 7 years, and it could continue from time to time. I expect you\u2019ll see that in 2Q. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll see it again for the rest of this year on a private to public. And then some of our permanent privates, we will have some wirehouse costs. They won\u2019t be the big lumpy upfronts like you\u2019ll see in the private to public, but we\u2019ll have that on an ongoing basis as well. That again is not as lumpy as the private to public.\nDouglas Ostrover: Yes. One -- and Alex, good to chat with you. Look, when you take a step back, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be recurring per se. But for the near term, we\u2019re kind of hoping for large numbers because that means we\u2019ve raised quite a bit of capital and the payback is relatively quick. And obviously, we do our best to drive that cost as low as possible. But it\u2019s a competitive market out there, and we\u2019re not paying any more than any of our peers. But we\u2019re hopeful in the near term to have big numbers, and then I think it will slow down over time. The biggest numbers, as Alan was alluding to, are not really from our recurring funds, our core income funds. It\u2019s when we\u2019re doing a specific BDC, and it\u2019s more of an episodic fund raise. So you\u2019ll see those less frequent and a much smaller number for the funds that are perpetually offered.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: I\u2019m expecting the biggest number, Alex, and we\u2019ll see how the year plays out. But I would expect the biggest number this year comes in 2Q, and that could bring a 15- to 20-plus percent G&A number as a ratio to revenues. And then I would expect it ticks down significantly from there in 3Q and then again in 4Q.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. All right. That makes sense. Just one other cleanup for me. A little nuance, but on the equity-based comp, if we look at the back of the deck, I think it\u2019s running quite a bit higher than what we\u2019re used to seeing. I think it\u2019s like $96 million for the quarter. Can you just flush out one more time what the equity-based comp run rate should be on a kind of go-forward basis and why it was elevated this quarter?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Yes, you\u2019re going to start to see now, and this is all GAAP numbers, obviously, Alex, you\u2019re going to start to see amortization of some of our earnouts for both Oak Street and coming up Wellfleet. But that piece you\u2019re seeing is largely Oak Street.\nAlex Blostein: Okay. But that\u2019s run rate, so like $90-plus million a quarter?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: It should be run rate, yes. We closed that at the very end of December, so you have a full quarter in for 1Q.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee.[Ph]\nUnidentified Analyst: Maybe, Doug, I kind of probably missed some of it, but could you maybe unpack a little bit some of the quarter-to-date fundraising? And I think I probably missed some of the numbers, but if you could just step through it, was the $2.8 million total so far, the right total. I kind of missed some of it.\nDouglas Ostrover: I\u2019m going to let Alan do it because I\u2019ll make a mistake.\u00a6\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Robert, how are you?\nUnidentified Analyst: Good. Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: So we\u2019ve got, year-to-date is about $6.7 billion. The quarter-to-date in 2Q is $2.8 billion. It\u2019s obviously through a couple of days ago. We have some products that closed on the 1st of the month like a core income product and some products that closed mid-month like Dyal Fund V. So it\u2019s a little bit of a mixed bag, whether that\u2019s 1 month or 2 months in our quarter-to-date numbers. But of the $2.8 billion, you\u2019ve got $2.2 billion of that that was raised in direct lending, about $500 million of that in GP Capital Solutions and then a very small contribution from real estate.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And then maybe on the GP Solutions business for Mike. Can you maybe -- you touched on it a little bit, but maybe drill a little bit deeper how this environment, and I don\u2019t know if it affects it at all, but how maybe the performance of the public managers impacts deployment or pricing as you see in the private markets? And then maybe as you think about Fund VI starting up in 2023, is there any reason to expect a different side targeted fund raise versus Fund V, I guess, call it the $9 billion? How should we think of that as we look ahead to next year?\nMichael Rees: Yes. Thanks, Rob. Good to speak with you. Sorry to give you a boring answer, but the GP Solution business, these partnerships come together after years and years of relationship building, a lot of deep thought on the side of these GPs that are the biggest and most important leaders in this space. So the wheels get set in motion, not just quarters ago, but years ago. And so there is very little market -- very little that the market volatility will do to impact the long-term strategic planning of these relationships. So our deployment is very sort of consistent when you look at it over multiple quarters or years. We\u2019re not seeing any slowdown. In fact, if anything, deal activity is quite robust. There\u2019s season seasonality in these conversations. We typically have -- since 2015, we\u2019ve only deployed about 10% of our capital in the first quarter and close to 65% to 70% of it builds as we move past the summer. So we see that happening now and why we\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019ll be on the Fund VI in 2023. So sizeable TBD, as we\u2019ve talked about our goals for V, our Fund V are $9 billion, and we\u2019ll see exactly where we land in that plane. Certainly confident in that number. And we\u2019ll see if we go above. But that will then sort of take us to our views on the size of Fund VI as we get into \u201823.\nUnidentified Analyst: And maybe digging into that a tiny bit, I mean how -- maybe how is this environment impacting your pace of fundraising. I mean I think there\u2019s been just generic -- some concern out there, not specific to the industry obviously, about the pace of fundraising given the volatility. And I think given your -- the nature of your LP base, maybe you find this as a kind of extending it a little more than it normally would? Or how should we think of that?\nMichael Rees: Yes, Rob, as you look at the performance of the funds, I mean, they\u2019re quite exceptional, we believe. And so the demand is there. We\u2019ve heard other peers talk about the denominator effect and how total commitments might be down. We don\u2019t see that. We don\u2019t see that at all across Blue Owl as you\u2019ve heard a big focus on retail. And as we focus on institutional fundraising, we\u2019re not seeing a slow -- we\u2019re not seeing a lower total commitment from large institutional investors. What we\u2019re seeing is a crowded market where bandwidth is the key constraint across the institutional set. As an example, we\u2019re working with a large institution that\u2019s going to make a commitment. They did all their work in January and February, and they\u2019ve just been trying to get us a slot on their investment committee calendar knowing that others in the market are having closes before ours. So we\u2019re -- for our product lineup, we don\u2019t see any real denominator effect, and we\u2019re raising capital ahead of the need for it from a deployment perspective. And we\u2019re able to think about a sooner raise for Fund VI than we had anticipated when you look back a couple of years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr.\nGlenn Schorr: So when I look at Slide 16 on the direct lending originations, you see it down sharply for the last couple of quarters and down a little bit year-on-year. But I heard your comments about the big pipeline and the second quarter looks good. So I wonder if we could talk about what produces that type of volatility. And if you could talk about whether it be second quarter or the rest of \u201822 in relation to some of the better quarters that you\u2019ve had.\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. Well, first, let me just kind of level set and then call on to sort of kind of where it goes from here. Actually this quarter, remember, there is definitely a seasonality to the private equity business and therefore the lending business. The fourth quarter will almost always be the strongest market conditions, obviously considered in terms of people closing before year-end and then restarting new transactions into the beginning of the year. So let\u2019s just take kind of a step back and compare numbers. Year-over-year, our originations were double last year. And our net originations were the second highest we\u2019ve ever experienced as a firm. So I just want to clarify and probably reframe the interpretation of Slide 16. This is actually -- if you look, this would be for 4 quarters running. If I do the comparison year-over-year, so added one more bar, the origination this quarter actually doubled, and the $3.4 million, as I said, is the highest -- second highest net we\u2019ve ever had. So starting point. Part 2, as I noted, how busy we have been, and it\u2019s been extraordinarily productively busy, I guess, not just busy. The tails though, to close things -- first of all, it always takes some amount of time between, hey, we started something in the beginning of the year, did a war breakout in February, obviously, and -- but importantly, and this is actually part of the strength of our model, a lot of these deals, the really large ones, are now take privates, as you know. And take private by their nature, of course, take longer from sign to close. That\u2019s quite fine by us. We obviously plan accordingly in terms of deployment of the capital. That\u2019s one of the great advantages of private capital over the syndicated market in a volatile environment like this, someone who doesn\u2019t actually want to own the risk is trying to make 2 points hoping they can clear the trade out to somebody else having to do that for 4, 5, 6 months. I don\u2019t think seems very appealing. For us, we\u2019re trying to own the paper. Now whether we have to wait a few months, 3 months on or 6 months in the context of our 5- to 7-year loan is quite fine. So with all that said, I think we expect Q2 to be a very robust quarter and into Q3, frankly, given the tails of some of these things. So the forward pipeline and this sets pipeline of signed but not yet closed, is extremely strong.\nGlenn Schorr: And that very robust, could we take that as similar year-on-year growthish?\nMarc Lipschultz: I can\u2019t give you guidance on exactly because of the timing of each of these deals, some are quite large. I just don\u2019t know. But I think you can take it as a definitely strong indication that we\u2019re heading into Q2 and Q3 with a typically large amount of paper already committed to not yet closed.\nDouglas Ostrover: I think it\u2019s important to remember, we are primarily funding new buyouts. And with over $2 trillion of dry powder sitting in the PE market, we expect M&A to remain robust, and we\u2019re really at the epicenter of all that. And so I think as you think about direct lending, I would focus a lot on PE fundraising. And as long as that stays strong, we expect over time to continue to have record originations. As Mark said, timing it quarter-to-quarter is nearly impossible. But I can tell you when we look at the amount of activity out there and the amount of dry powder, we expect the pipeline for financing and the pipeline for capital to -- or the capital needs to remain really robust.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: And I would also add, Glenn, that as you saw, transaction fees come down in 1Q, commensurate with gross originations. Marc is talking about atypical levels in 2Q and 3Q. You could generally expect transaction fees will follow that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt.\nPatrick Davitt: Most of my questions have been answered. Maybe just one on the tech lending side. So you\u2019ve got RTF 2 in the market right, ORTIC launched and the hope that ORTF I could go public. So as we look to the IPO of ORTF I in particular, how do we think about the potential for that to actually happen given the amount of fundraising you\u2019re doing for ORTF II or ORTIC. And I think the latter has lower fees than ORTF I would have once it goes public. So could you kind of unpack all those dynamics? And does it push out, I guess, the view to ORTF I going public?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Patrick, and good question. Look, we can\u2019t comment publicly on the exact timing of an IPO, obviously, ORTF has had a [CC registrant]. Just pulling the lens back on that for a moment, though, obviously right now the markets aren\u2019t the right type of markets to try to do an IPO. That portfolio is fully invested, it\u2019s fully levered. Our shareholders are enjoying a low fee structure. So we\u2019re not in a rush to get out an IPO. We want to make sure we have the right markets to do that. And we\u2019re done fundraising there. We\u2019re done fundraising. We\u2019re done with deployment. We\u2019re just replacing paydowns at this point. So again, fully invested, fully levered portfolio. And we\u2019re obviously fundraising now for ORTF 2. So exact timing, TBD, we\u2019ll have to see what the markets hold in the back half of this year, but obviously right now is not the right time to take it out.\nMarc Lipschultz: Maybe just adding a comment, stitching it together. It is certainly true that the market volatility has implications for the exact timing of when we list it, and I [indiscernible] really as opposed to IPO because once listed is when the fees step up. And that can be done obviously in quite different environments from potential IPO. But we\u2019re not going to try to do anything that doesn\u2019t make good sense for everyone, for all the investors. And so with that said, I mean, could it vary by a quarter as to when that step up, which then lasts permanently comes in. It could. I mean, so within a quarter, as Doug keeps saying, we don\u2019t try to think about our business quarter-to-quarter that way, but we know where the destination is with that one. But that same volatility is what\u2019s creating so much opportunity for investment in the tech space. But we already talked about this, I won\u2019t rehash it, but the enormous amount of activity to purchase software companies and then what we think will be the significant need for private businesses intact for structured capital, that volatility is quite [the front] for what we think will be the strong results we can deliver in OR Tech II and ORTIC.\nDouglas Ostrover: And just one quick thing. And I think on the 20th at Investor Day we will give everyone a lot more color about our expectations of fundraising in all of those products.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: The other thing I\u2019d add, Patrick, when I gave my guidance on our February call about the $1.3 billion of revenues that we would expect to post for 2022, I\u2019ve talked separately about the $65 million fee step up. There\u2019s very little of that $65 million in my $1.3 billion.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty.\nAdam Beatty: Probably just 1 for me today about Wellfleet. And just wanted to understand, obviously we saw a business, a good addition to the franchise. I want to understand how you\u2019re thinking about synergies on the product side and maybe the distribution side as well. We\u2019ve been talking a lot about retail and other product development. How does Wellfleet fit into that kind of bigger picture?\nDouglas Ostrover: Well, thanks for the question. Well, there\u2019s just a tremendous amount of synergies with our direct lending business, especially in our core income product where we provide some liquidity. So we really needed the public market expertise. And we were debating, do we build it internally or do we go out and acquire it and have a group that has a dedicated track record, a great track record, by the way, pays for themselves, and we think we can grow that business significantly. So they just joined recently. I think it was April 1. It\u2019s been a seamless transaction. We\u2019re really excited about having that team on. And it\u2019s a relatively small business, 6 and change billion of assets. I think we can create a tremendous amount of value there. And I think we can make multiples of a return on our investment. But it was a relatively small investment. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a material impact on our earnings, but I think it will be highly accretive. And again, on Investor Day, we\u2019ll spend some time going through that in a lot more detail.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. CEO, Doug Ostrover, I turn the call back over to you.\nDouglas Ostrover: Well, we appreciate everybody spending about an hour with us. We\u2019re grateful for everybody listening in. And as always, our goal is to try to exceed expectations. I really encourage all of you, if you can make it to Investor Day on the 20th, I think you\u2019d find it worthwhile. You\u2019ll be able to watch it over Zoom as well, and we\u2019re excited to really share the vision of what we think we can build here. So we look forward to following up again in a few weeks. Thanks again, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Thanks, Doug. As you can see on Slide 16, we continue to expand our direct lending business with gross originations of $4.9 billion, more than double what we originated in the first quarter of 2021. Industry-wide the first quarter was a seasonally lighter quarter for M&A, and was also affected by market volatility. As Doug alluded to in his remarks, we continue to expand our market share, driven by the predictability, privacy and partnership that we offer to borrowers. We're also seeing larger deals come to the direct lending space, which we are very well-positioned to address given the scale of Blue Owl's platform and capital base. For context, last year we evaluated over 40 investments with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion and signed or closed on roughly half of them. Just in the first quarter of 2022 we sourced over 20 investments with facility sizes in excess of $1 billion and committed to roughly half of them. And of those greater than 20 opportunities, 5 had facilities sizes in excess of $2.5 billion. We expect some of these to close during the second quarter. For the last 12 months, gross originations and direct lending have been $26.4 billion or 3x what we originated in the prior 12-month period. And we continue to see an extremely active pipeline, setting ourselves up for a robust quarter in 2Q. Performance remains strong, with growth and net appreciation of the direct lending products of approximately 1% and 0.2% for the first quarter respectively, and 14.1% and 9.7% respectively for the last 12 months. And we've continued to focus on downside protection with a weighted average loan-to-value in the low 40s across direct lending portfolios. Credit quality remains very robust, with annualized net realized losses of approximately 5 basis points since inception. We raised $1.9 billion in direct lending strategies during the first quarter, of which retail constituted $1.4 billion, primarily for our Core Income Fund, one of our diversified lending BDCs. Also contributing to the fundraising during the first quarter were closes in tech lending. As of May 2, we raised a further $2.2 billion across direct lending in the second quarter so far. Also on April 1 we announced the closing of our Wellfleet acquisition, which will add almost $7 billion of AUM to our second quarter numbers. Our direct lending business continues to broaden in size and scope, and we remain optimistic about the growth opportunities we see ahead, supported by robust demand from both retail and institutional investors. Now moving on to our real estate business. We continue to a robust opportunity set with roughly $2 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract to close and a near-term pipeline of more than $20 billion of potential volume. As of today, we've invested over half of the equity in our fifth closed-end fund, bringing us closer to launching our real estate fund 6. As Doug mentioned in his remarks, our real estate strategy should benefit from investor demand for inflation-protected cash flows backed by investment-grade and credit-worthy tenants. And our investment opportunity set continues to improve as corporate borrowing costs increase. Contractual rent escalations are structured into all of our triple net leases. And 100% of all operating expenses, including cost increases are borne by the tenant, which further limits the strategies from any adverse effects of inflation. Since inception, we have never had a tenant miss a rent payment, go bankrupt or default on a lease. And we've generated a net IRR of 26% on average across our fully realized closed-end funds. And gross and net appreciation across our real estate portfolio of 5.7% and 5% respectively for the first quarter and 36% and 32.1% respectively for the last 12 months. These are remarkable risk-adjusted returns for the underlying credit profile of these portfolios. As we look ahead, we expect to launch our sixth real estate closed-end fund in the latter half of the year, and continue to accept capital into our open-end fund net lease property fund. We're also in the process of working on new products that we will look to discuss in greater detail at Investor Day. With that, let me turn it to Michael to discuss GP Solutions. Craig, it's Marc. I'll take that one. So I think it's both our expectations, but it's also the reality. The activity levels right now, we have never seen more large and high-quality opportunities, and they're almost entirely in the software space, and we are the market leader in terms of capabilities in that space. So both sitting here now and just to give you a statistic to go with this, again, the preponderance of this being driven by software. If you look at last year, there's a total of 40 private financings that we saw of $1 billion or greater, again, very heavily driven by software. This first quarter alone, we see over 20 that are $1 billion or greater. And now a new category has entered $2.5 billion or greater. And the reason that matters is not just the size, it does speak to deployment opportunity, but these are incredibly large market-leading global companies. So I couldn't -- and we're not trying to comment on whether their growth rates be exactly what the sponsors think better, worse, 20%, 15%, 25%, that's not what matters to us. It's the durability and attractiveness of the long-term franchise in our tech portfolio, our tech -- Own Rock Tech I we lend on average in the low 30% level. So if one just took an abstract $5 billion buyout, which is no longer large in the tax sector, that would be $1.5 billion of debt with a $3.5 billion equity check. So our bullishness comes from both the current activity level, which is quite exceptional. Our outlook, which is with all the dry powder, $2 trillion of dry powder in the hands of private equity, again with a particular concentration, heavily tipped towards software and tech that needs to be and will be deployed. Many of the sponsors see this disruption in the market as a moment of opportunity. The time will tell if that's true or not, but that is clearly the action that's been undertaken. And that's leading to some of the best things we've seen, frankly. And I guess just add one more, remember, we also have this structured capability in tech. This is our yield-enhanced capability that was really built for this exact environment, which is companies that are great private tech companies that maybe got ahead of themselves on valuations. It doesn't mean they are deeply valuable. And these are some of our most exciting lowest-risk opportunities where we also get equity upside. So I'm really not trying to overstate it. We feel like now is exactly kind of the pinnacle moment for the tech opportunity. And I apologize [indiscernible] small comment on that point, which is in our tech lending platform, Owl Rock Tech I, we have since inception still never had a default. We've never had a loan in arrears. So the durability, again, isn't really a case of theory. It's been the most durable sector in our portfolio and broader than that. But I think there's a lot to like right now. Yes. A couple of things. It's a great question, of course. So first, let me take one step back and as a Blue Owl matter I think it's really important for the shareholders. Remember, Blue Owl as a firm, we are essentially 100% fee-driven revenue, management fee-driven revenue. And so we care deeply about the performance of our products. But actually, the question you're raising doesn't affect the earnings of Blue Owl. We don't have carry. So that question is going to be very salient for firms that are carry centric and have a variety of products that go up and down with the answer to a question like that or an equity valuation changes. We don't, we get paid fees. So for Blue Owl shareholders on this call, the fortunate answer to questions like what happens if credit quality issues tick up or what happens with inflation, the answer doesn't matter to people on this call. Now it matters to us matters, it matters to all of us when we think about growth of products. So let me still answer your question because of course we care a lot about it as a firm and for our LPs. So credit quality has remained very strong, very robust. We continue to run at extremely low delinquency rates, default rates. I mean, any measure you want to use, we continue to feel extremely good. The portfolio is in robust shape. Across our platform in total, we're running at loan to values in the low 40s. We refer to 30s for tech. It's in the low 40s across the whole firm. As we go into this, most of our borrowers are in very strong shape. Remember, we've always built at Owl Rock, Blue Owl in particular, a very defensive strategy. That is to say we've always erred on the side of low risk, which, to summary you can say hasn't mattered over the last several years. Well, now it's going to matter. And we have built into our franchise on, look, we want the best companies with low loan to values and you can give us 50 extra basis points to get us to take impairment risk. That's just not how we operate. And those differences are going to start to show amongst managers. So here again, let's go with the statistics, we're in $56 billion of loans, and we're running at a 5 basis point realized loss rate and the losses in total associate with $300 million of original notional loans. So of course, a more rocky environment. Of course, that's an uptick. I don't think any of invest planning for what amounts to [indiscernible] 0 losses. But portfolio is looking very strong and final statistics as we go into this across the broader portfolio, EBITDA to interest coverage. We're heading in with an average of 2.7x. So there's a lot of room in that statistic for both declines in EBITDA, even though these are generally pretty robust businesses that we invest in as well as rising rates off a low floor. So again, we're not being dismissive. We're thinking real hard about the volatile environment, but we're feeling quite good. Sure. Very happy to, Alex. Thank you. So first off, the $20 billion really refer to sort of pipeline. So it really speaks, I mean, it has to flow through, of course, like in every investment business, we end up doing a very small portion of the things we look at and consider. But really the point of the statistic is it remains a very, very robust opportunity set much, much larger than our target deployment levels. So book-to-bill, so to speak, not quite book, but the opportunity set is very robust as we sit here. So that was really the purpose of that statistic, remains very strong compared to historical standards. As to the outlook to your very good point, so there's a few forces at work. By and large, this environment is quite appealing for our real estate business. It's appealing because as cost of capital within the corporate structure rises, then of course our triple net lease solutions may in many cases, look more competitive to what, I guess, we might have thought of before as low, maybe kind of oddly low borrowing costs for strong corporate borrowers back last year, last quarter for that matter. So as those costs come up, I think our solutions actually look more competitive, number one. Number two, in a more volatile environment, people obviously look for other ways to finance outside of what might be just the obvious, okay, well, I'll go issue a bond, I'll just go borrow from a bank. And so we offer these structured solutions that for those who have real estate assets, they could tap into. So we look at the backdrop as quite positive for the point of deployment. And from the point of view of what that means, though, for the quality of the assets and the performance, here is the beauty of it. First off, since inception of Oak Street we were very excited about our credit performance of 5 basis points realized loss. In Oak Street, we've never had a single rent payment missed, a single rent payment missed, let alone a default. I mean that durability is, I would say, pretty extraordinary. And so what we like about this composition is more people are looking for creative solutions, cost of capital are up, so that gives more room for us to put our solutions in place. And then the durability of having both the asset and the corporate counterparty on a 15-, 20-year net lease feels in a volatile environment to a true flight to safety. Sure. Thanks, Alex. The lumpiest ones or the larger upfront ones are really on our private to public BDC raises. And we've had this a couple of times in the past over the last 7 years, and it could continue from time to time. I expect you'll see that in 2Q. I don't know that you'll see it again for the rest of this year on a private to public. And then some of our permanent privates, we will have some wirehouse costs. They won't be the big lumpy upfronts like you'll see in the private to public, but we'll have that on an ongoing basis as well. That again is not as lumpy as the private to public. Sure. Well, first, let me just kind of level set and then call on to sort of kind of where it goes from here. Actually this quarter, remember, there is definitely a seasonality to the private equity business and therefore the lending business. The fourth quarter will almost always be the strongest market conditions, obviously considered in terms of people closing before year-end and then restarting new transactions into the beginning of the year. So let's just take kind of a step back and compare numbers. Year-over-year, our originations were double last year. And our net originations were the second highest we've ever experienced as a firm. So I just want to clarify and probably reframe the interpretation of Slide 16. This is actually -- if you look, this would be for 4 quarters running. If I do the comparison year-over-year, so added one more bar, the origination this quarter actually doubled, and the $3.4 million, as I said, is the highest -- second highest net we've ever had. So starting point. Part 2, as I noted, how busy we have been, and it's been extraordinarily productively busy, I guess, not just busy. The tails though, to close things -- first of all, it always takes some amount of time between, hey, we started something in the beginning of the year, did a war breakout in February, obviously, and -- but importantly, and this is actually part of the strength of our model, a lot of these deals, the really large ones, are now take privates, as you know. And take private by their nature, of course, take longer from sign to close. That's quite fine by us. We obviously plan accordingly in terms of deployment of the capital. That's one of the great advantages of private capital over the syndicated market in a volatile environment like this, someone who doesn't actually want to own the risk is trying to make 2 points hoping they can clear the trade out to somebody else having to do that for 4, 5, 6 months. I don't think seems very appealing. For us, we're trying to own the paper. Now whether we have to wait a few months, 3 months on or 6 months in the context of our 5- to 7-year loan is quite fine. So with all that said, I think we expect Q2 to be a very robust quarter and into Q3, frankly, given the tails of some of these things. So the forward pipeline and this sets pipeline of signed but not yet closed, is extremely strong. I can't give you guidance on exactly because of the timing of each of these deals, some are quite large. I just don't know. But I think you can take it as a definitely strong indication that we're heading into Q2 and Q3 with a typically large amount of paper already committed to not yet closed. Maybe just adding a comment, stitching it together. It is certainly true that the market volatility has implications for the exact timing of when we list it, and I [indiscernible] really as opposed to IPO because once listed is when the fees step up. And that can be done obviously in quite different environments from potential IPO. But we're not going to try to do anything that doesn't make good sense for everyone, for all the investors. And so with that said, I mean, could it vary by a quarter as to when that step up, which then lasts permanently comes in. It could. I mean, so within a quarter, as Doug keeps saying, we don't try to think about our business quarter-to-quarter that way, but we know where the destination is with that one. But that same volatility is what's creating so much opportunity for investment in the tech space. But we already talked about this, I won't rehash it, but the enormous amount of activity to purchase software companies and then what we think will be the significant need for private businesses intact for structured capital, that volatility is quite [the front] for what we think will be the strong results we can deliver in OR Tech II and ORTIC."

            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation as Ann mentioned. So please feel free to have that available to follow along. Okay, let's start off by covering our quarterly results. We closed our acquisition of Wellfleet on April 1. So you won't see those numbers in our results until the second quarter. Our first quarter was another quarter of strong growth for our business. Management fees are up $41.1 million or 19% from last quarter, and up over 50% from the first quarter a year ago when you adjust out catch-up fees for Dyal Fund V. Broken down by divisions, direct lending management fees are up $12.8 million or 11% from last quarter, and up 41% from the first quarter a year ago. GP Capital Solutions' management fees are up $11.1 million or 12% from last quarter and up 42% from the first quarter a year ago again when you adjust out catch-up fees and Dyal Fund V. And real estate management fees, which began contributing to our results on Jan 1 of this year were $17.2 million. FRE is up 4% from last quarter, and up 56% from the first quarter a year ago. FRE margins are up a little from last quarter as well. Our ratio of compensation as a percentage of revenue came down a little this quarter to 27.5%. I expect for 2022 we will be in the lower half of the range that we've previously guided to, which was 25% to 30%. And we announced a dividend of $0.10 cents per share for the first quarter. All of this is in line with our expectations in what I noted on our earnings call last quarter. We have started off the year in making good progress towards reaching $1.3 billion of revenues for 2022, which would be a 45% growth rate year-over-year and an FRE margin of 60-plus percent for 2022. As it relates to our AUM metrics, on Slide 13, we reported AUM of $102 billion, repaying AUM of $65.6 billion and total permanent capital of $85.6 billion. AUM not yet paying fees was $7.7 billion as of March 31. As Doug mentioned, inclusive of the Wellfleet acquisition, our AUM would be approximately $109 billion. AUM grew $7.5 billion to $102 billion, an 8% increase from last quarter and a 76% increase from the first quarter a year ago, driven primarily by deployment of capital and debt raised in direct lending, the addition of our real estate division and capital raising across the firm. Fee-paying AUM grew $4.1 billion to $65.6 billion, a 7% increase from last quarter, and a 64% increase from the first quarter a year ago, driven primarily by deployment in direct lending, the addition of our real estate division and capital raising across the firm. Permanent capital grew $6.8 billion to $85.6 billion, a 9% increase from last quarter and a 61% increase from the first quarter a year ago, driven primarily by deployment in direct lending, the addition of our real estate division and capital raising across the firm. AUM not yet paying fees was $7.7 billion, including $5.4 billion in direct lending, $0.7 billion in GP Capital Solutions and $1.6 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling approximately $105 million, primarily upon deployment for direct lending and real estate. As I've mentioned in the past, if our tech BDC were to go public, we expect that could be another incremental $65 million of annual management fees due to the fee step-ups. With the launch of our new tech lending BDC, ORTF II and combined with ORCC III, upon the listing of all 3 of these BDCs, we expect that could be a total incremental $185 million of annual management fees. I plan to get into this more on Investor Day, so please stay tuned for that. As Marc highlighted earlier, we had another strong quarter of deployment in direct lending with gross originations of $4.9 billion and net funded deployment of $3.4 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $26.4 billion with $14.7 billion of net funded deployment. So as it relates to the $5.4 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us less than 2 quarters to fully deploy this based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on Slide 23, we currently have almost $1 billion of liquidity with a very long-dated capital structure. On another note, as Marc touched on, we have raised a significant amount of equity in our direct lending business year-to-date, in particular since quarter end. There are 2 items here I wanted to flag for everyone on this point. The first item, as we continue to fund raise, there will be varying levels of distribution replacement costs associated with different raises for our various BDCs. So to provide more clarity here using the example of raising $1 billion and assuming we pay out $25 million to $30 million in onetime upfront distribution replacement fee expenses on certain equity dollars raised, this will generate over time approximately $50 million of management fees, including Part I fees per year, every year, it's permitting capital. So just making the point here that for our second quarter of 2022, based on what we're seeing so far, we expect to show a potentially large nonrecurring expense in our G&A line related to these fundraises and a much smaller amount of incremental management fees for that quarter due to this timing mismatch. I'll be sure to call this out in my prepared remarks when and as this happens, so it's visible and transparent to everyone. The second item, more specifically, as it relates to our ORTIC product, just a reminder here that we have a fee waiver in place for this product through October 31 of this year, so we're not earning management fees on this product for almost all of this year. Full fee start up on November 1. Both of these items were part of the 2022 outlook that I discussed on our last earnings call in February. So to wrap up here, before getting to Q&A, there's a few last items I want to cover. First, at our Investor Day coming up on May 20, we'll be talking about a number of different ways in which we believe we can drive shareholder value. One of the areas we identified was the potential to be included in the Russell indices. On April 11 we announced the change to the voting power of our Class A shares, which represents our public float. When we initially looked into this, we believe we had satisfied all of the other required criteria to be included in the Russell indices with this one exception. We did this to open the potential to be included in the newly reconstituted Russell indices at the end of next month. Next, our stock buyback program. During the first quarter, Blue Owl bought back 2 million shares of stock at an average cost of $12.09 per share. Pulling the lens back a little on this topic, starting this year we generally expect to buy back stock that we issue in connection with stock compensation. We're not trying to get this exactly right on a quarterly basis or even annually, but over the course of time we expect to buy back shares to offset dilution from stock compensation. Finally, Doug touched on inflation and rising rates in his remarks, so I wanted to hit this with everyone. Our business is very well positioned for a rising rate environment. If you look at Slide 17 of our earnings presentation, you will see that our 1Q annualized FRE revenue could increase by 2- to 4-plus percent if rates increase by 200 to 300 basis points. This would all be incremental to anything we have previously discussed. We didn't include potential rate changes in our forecast, but not included in the 2022 revenue target given in February of $1.3 billion. Summing it all up, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter. We are hitting in all of our key metrics, and we continue to have very exciting growth plans ahead of us, which we feel we are well positioned to execute on. We look forward to seeing everyone later this month at our Investor Day event. Thank you again to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that, operator, can we please open the line for questions? I'm expecting the biggest number, Alex, and we'll see how the year plays out. But I would expect the biggest number this year comes in 2Q, and that could bring a 15- to 20-plus percent G&A number as a ratio to revenues. And then I would expect it ticks down significantly from there in 3Q and then again in 4Q. Yes, you're going to start to see now, and this is all GAAP numbers, obviously, Alex, you're going to start to see amortization of some of our earnouts for both Oak Street and coming up Wellfleet. But that piece you're seeing is largely Oak Street. It should be run rate, yes. We closed that at the very end of December, so you have a full quarter in for 1Q. Robert, how are you? So we've got, year-to-date is about $6.7 billion. The quarter-to-date in 2Q is $2.8 billion. It's obviously through a couple of days ago. We have some products that closed on the 1st of the month like a core income product and some products that closed mid-month like Dyal Fund V. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag, whether that's 1 month or 2 months in our quarter-to-date numbers. But of the $2.8 billion, you've got $2.2 billion of that that was raised in direct lending, about $500 million of that in GP Capital Solutions and then a very small contribution from real estate. And I would also add, Glenn, that as you saw, transaction fees come down in 1Q, commensurate with gross originations. Marc is talking about atypical levels in 2Q and 3Q. You could generally expect transaction fees will follow that. Thanks, Patrick, and good question. Look, we can't comment publicly on the exact timing of an IPO, obviously, ORTF has had a [CC registrant]. Just pulling the lens back on that for a moment, though, obviously right now the markets aren't the right type of markets to try to do an IPO. That portfolio is fully invested, it's fully levered. Our shareholders are enjoying a low fee structure. So we're not in a rush to get out an IPO. We want to make sure we have the right markets to do that. And we're done fundraising there. We're done fundraising. We're done with deployment. We're just replacing paydowns at this point. So again, fully invested, fully levered portfolio. And we're obviously fundraising now for ORTF 2. So exact timing, TBD, we'll have to see what the markets hold in the back half of this year, but obviously right now is not the right time to take it out. The other thing I'd add, Patrick, when I gave my guidance on our February call about the $1.3 billion of revenues that we would expect to post for 2022, I've talked separately about the $65 million fee step up. There's very little of that $65 million in my $1.3 billion."

            "name": "Michael Rees",
            "content": "Thank you, Marc. Our GP Capital Solutions business has continued to benefit from the secular tailwinds across the alternative asset manager space as more firms enter our investible opportunity set and as these managers needs for capital continues to expand. Across our partner managers, we continue to see robust fundraising and deployment, particularly as the market sell-off created new and interesting investment opportunities. As of today, we have invested, committed or have an agreement in principle to commit approximately two-thirds of what we expect to raise for Dyal Fund 5. And the pipeline remains strong. Performance remains similarly strong with a gross and net IRR of 32% and 24% respectively for Fund III and 127% and 81% respectively were Fund IV. In addition to the $1 billion raised for Fund V during the first quarter, we have closed on a subsequent $400 million of capital in April, bringing us to $7.2 billion raised for the fund. We remain confident in our prior capital raising expectations for this strategy. Further, we look forward to launching a follow-on vehicle sometime in 2023, as we become more fully committed in this current fund. As we look ahead, we're very optimistic about what the next year holds for the GP Capital Solutions business, given the constructive trends for growth and the demand we're experiencing for our strategies. Market volatility and shifts to the status quo will continue to create interesting fundraising and investment opportunities and we will benefit from that environment as the premier capital solution provider to these managers. With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results. Yes. Thanks, Rob. Good to speak with you. Sorry to give you a boring answer, but the GP Solution business, these partnerships come together after years and years of relationship building, a lot of deep thought on the side of these GPs that are the biggest and most important leaders in this space. So the wheels get set in motion, not just quarters ago, but years ago. And so there is very little market -- very little that the market volatility will do to impact the long-term strategic planning of these relationships. So our deployment is very sort of consistent when you look at it over multiple quarters or years. We're not seeing any slowdown. In fact, if anything, deal activity is quite robust. There's season seasonality in these conversations. We typically have -- since 2015, we've only deployed about 10% of our capital in the first quarter and close to 65% to 70% of it builds as we move past the summer. So we see that happening now and why we're pretty confident that we'll be on the Fund VI in 2023. So sizeable TBD, as we've talked about our goals for V, our Fund V are $9 billion, and we'll see exactly where we land in that plane. Certainly confident in that number. And we'll see if we go above. But that will then sort of take us to our views on the size of Fund VI as we get into \u201823. Yes, Rob, as you look at the performance of the funds, I mean, they're quite exceptional, we believe. And so the demand is there. We've heard other peers talk about the denominator effect and how total commitments might be down. We don't see that. We don't see that at all across Blue Owl as you've heard a big focus on retail. And as we focus on institutional fundraising, we're not seeing a slow -- we're not seeing a lower total commitment from large institutional investors. What we're seeing is a crowded market where bandwidth is the key constraint across the institutional set. As an example, we're working with a large institution that's going to make a commitment. They did all their work in January and February, and they've just been trying to get us a slot on their investment committee calendar knowing that others in the market are having closes before ours. So we're -- for our product lineup, we don't see any real denominator effect, and we're raising capital ahead of the need for it from a deployment perspective. And we're able to think about a sooner raise for Fund VI than we had anticipated when you look back a couple of years."

            "name": "Douglas Ostrover",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann. And good morning, everyone. As you see captured on Slide 9 of our earnings presentation, we reported another quarter of strong results for Blue Owl with AUM up 76%, private wealth fundraising up 172%, management fees up 51%, and FRE up 56% on a year-over-year basis. Pro forma for the Wellfleet acquisition, which closed on April 1, AUM, would have been approximately $109 billion. Originations for the quarter more than doubled versus a year ago, and private wealth fundraising reaching $2.2 billion. And with permanent capital driving 95% of our management fees and an earning stream consisting of stable and growing fee-related earnings Blue Owl's financial profile stood in stark contrast to a volatile public equity and debt market backdrop during the first quarter. Our strategies, focused on income generation and downside protection, continued to perform well. Investment pipelines across the platform have been robust, and fundraising for the quarter was strong, but more importantly, as we look ahead, there are some meaningful fundraising initiatives starting to bear fruit which I will highlight in more detail in a few minutes. First, let me start with some commentary on the broader market environment, which has been top of mind for shareholders. Over the past quarter, we have witnessed volatility and dispersion in the public markets resulting from high and persistent inflation, a shifting interest rate environment, geopolitical events, and ongoing impact from COVID globally. These factors unsurprisingly created some near-term headwinds to industry-wide M&A and capital markets activity as investors paused to react to updated information, market expectations and a changing investment landscape. Given our scale and patient permanent capital, Blue Owl has been a beneficiary of this market volatility as an increasing number of sponsors and private companies have looked to direct lending for flexible and dependable financing. We are having dialogues on larger deals than we've ever seen. And in particular, this has been a very robust environment for our tech lending strategy. And the increasing number of public to private transactions have driven incremental market share towards direct lenders who can offer certainty of execution through what can be a lengthy process. For our GP Solutions business, the pipeline for investment has only strengthened as alternative asset managers evaluate the options they have for liquidity and growth capital in today's market. And the opportunity for alternative asset managers to put dry powder to work has improved, pulling forward deployment activity and setting firms up for the next round of fundraising. In real estate, rising corporate borrowing costs should drive incremental demand for our net lease solutions. So in aggregate, we're seeing positive impacts to the investment landscape across Blue Owl as a result of the current market environment. And with regards to the rising interest rate environment, as we discussed last quarter, we anticipate a net positive impact across the platform. We expect direct lending to be a beneficiary of rising rates as investor demand increases for senior secured floating rate assets, focused on downside protection. And over time, the effective rising rates would be positive for the net interest income of our loan portfolios, which Alan will touch on shortly. For GP Solutions, market volatility should drive demand for products managed by large diversified managers benefiting the types of firms Dyal has typically taken stakes in. With respect to our real estate business, we believe there will continue to be strong demand for real estate strategies with long-term contractual income that are positively correlated to inflation and backed by investment-grade tenants. Moving on to our first quarter results. We continue to demonstrate steady robust growth, hallmarks of the Blue Owl business model as a result of our permanent capital and FRE-centric earnings. Since we don't have the volatility of carried interest running through our revenue, we just continue to add to the layer cake of earnings through new capital raised and deployed. Fundraising for the quarter was well diversified, with nearly $4 billion of equity capital raised primarily from our diversified lending, technology lending and GP minority stake strategies, bringing our last 12 month equity capital raise to $11.3 billion. And for the second quarter to-date, we're up to a great start, raising $2.8 billion across the platform. In direct lending, we have raised an additional $2.2 billion subsequent to quarter-end across institutional and wealth channels. As we have spoken about in prior quarters, we anticipate that tech lending will be one of the fastest-growing parts of our business over the next few years as our strong performance and exceptional credit quality in that strategy resonates with a wide spectrum of investors. As it relates to our growing private wealth distribution, which we've also spoken about frequently as an important focus for Blue Owl, we continue to make very good progress in expanding our platform across products and geographies. $2.2 billion of the capital we raised in the first quarter or over half of the total was driven by private wealth. This is over 4x the amount we raised through wealth in the second quarter of 2021, less than a year ago. We are generating over 9% annualized organic growth just from our current private wealth flows, which are permanent capital and which we think we can grow meaningfully over time. And this doesn't take into account any institutional fundraising, new products that we plan to introduce to the market or continued expansion of our wealth distribution platform globally. As of May 2, we raised a further $2.1 billion from private wealth across direct lending, GP Solutions and real estate in the second quarter. As you've heard from us before, and will continue to hear going forward, we are very excited about the opportunity ahead in private wealth and look forward to sharing more developments at Investor Day on May 20. Looking forward, as I think about the key elements of our growth over the next few years, I truly believe that each of our businesses has significant growth ahead. We see meaningful runway to raise capital across institutional and wealth channels as investors look for income, inflation-hedge solutions and downside protection in an uncertain market environment. Each of our businesses has generated scale and offers real competitive advantages that translate into differentiated investment performance. And the returns have resonated with our investors. Today, we have multiple products raising capital on various platforms globally in private wealth. Dyal V fundraising continues, and we are well on our way to fully deploying that fund and being back in the market for Fund VI. We also have, and will have a number of funds raising capital from institutional investors across direct lending and real estate over the course of the year. Later this month at our Investor Day, we plan to lay out some key growth goals and get into greater detail on the investment and fundraising landscape that we see for each of our businesses. We hope to see all of you there in person or on the webcast and look forward to spending some time highlighting our strategic vision and the substantial growth we see ahead. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to mark, to give you an update on our direct lending and real estate businesses. Mark? Yes. And I'll just chime in for 30 seconds. Marc, really hit on all the high points. But I think it's important to remember, when we talk about technology, we're talking mostly about enterprise software. We don't do start-ups. We look for things that have high recurring revenue, very little churn, high predictability of cash flow. And so as we look out across the lending landscape, we actually think these businesses are some, maybe the best things we can lend to. So we're excited about it, and we're excited about our position in the market. Yes. One -- and Alex, good to chat with you. Look, when you take a step back, I don't think they'll be recurring per se. But for the near term, we're kind of hoping for large numbers because that means we've raised quite a bit of capital and the payback is relatively quick. And obviously, we do our best to drive that cost as low as possible. But it's a competitive market out there, and we're not paying any more than any of our peers. But we're hopeful in the near term to have big numbers, and then I think it will slow down over time. The biggest numbers, as Alan was alluding to, are not really from our recurring funds, our core income funds. It's when we're doing a specific BDC, and it's more of an episodic fund raise. So you'll see those less frequent and a much smaller number for the funds that are perpetually offered. I'm going to let Alan do it because I'll make a mistake.\u00a6 I think it's important to remember, we are primarily funding new buyouts. And with over $2 trillion of dry powder sitting in the PE market, we expect M&A to remain robust, and we're really at the epicenter of all that. And so I think as you think about direct lending, I would focus a lot on PE fundraising. And as long as that stays strong, we expect over time to continue to have record originations. As Mark said, timing it quarter-to-quarter is nearly impossible. But I can tell you when we look at the amount of activity out there and the amount of dry powder, we expect the pipeline for financing and the pipeline for capital to -- or the capital needs to remain really robust. And just one quick thing. And I think on the 20th at Investor Day we will give everyone a lot more color about our expectations of fundraising in all of those products. Well, thanks for the question. Well, there's just a tremendous amount of synergies with our direct lending business, especially in our core income product where we provide some liquidity. So we really needed the public market expertise. And we were debating, do we build it internally or do we go out and acquire it and have a group that has a dedicated track record, a great track record, by the way, pays for themselves, and we think we can grow that business significantly. So they just joined recently. I think it was April 1. It's been a seamless transaction. We're really excited about having that team on. And it's a relatively small business, 6 and change billion of assets. I think we can create a tremendous amount of value there. And I think we can make multiples of a return on our investment. But it was a relatively small investment. So I don't think it's going to have a material impact on our earnings, but I think it will be highly accretive. And again, on Investor Day, we'll spend some time going through that in a lot more detail. Well, we appreciate everybody spending about an hour with us. We're grateful for everybody listening in. And as always, our goal is to try to exceed expectations. I really encourage all of you, if you can make it to Investor Day on the 20th, I think you'd find it worthwhile. You'll be able to watch it over Zoom as well, and we're excited to really share the vision of what we think we can build here. So we look forward to following up again in a few weeks. Thanks again, everyone."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ann Dai, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nAnn Dai: Thanks operator and good morning everyone. Joining me today are Marc Lipschultz, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company's control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time-to-time in Blue Owl's Capital's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We'd also like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, available on the Investor Resources section of our website at blueowl.com. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blue Owl funds. This morning, we issued our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, reporting fee-related earnings, or FRE of $0.20 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.70 per share for the year and distributable earnings, or DE of $0.18 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.65 per share for the year. We declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth quarter payable on March 5th to holders of record as of February 23rd and also announced an annual fixed dividend of $0.72 for 2024 or $0.18 per quarter, starting with our 2024 first quarter earnings. During the call today, we'll be referring to the earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning. So, please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thank you, Ann. We finished 2023 on a strong note with another consecutive quarter of management fee and FRE growth, 11 for 11 since we've been a public company against a market backdrop that has been exceptionally volatile and uncertain. We're confident that our steady, strong, and resilient growth continues to differentiate Blue Owl and highlight the benefits of our business model. Over the past year, we've operated in an environment where the ongoing impact of higher interest rates and future rate uncertainty have constrained capital market activity and capital deployment. And exiting this year, the short-term path of interest rates, geopolitical risk levels, and economic growth trends remain heavily debating. By design, Blue Owl's growth has been distinctly more predictable, which is very thesis from the beginning. Our assets are generally permanent capital and our earnings don't include more volatile revenues such as carry and substantial capital markets fees. We strive to be market leaders in the segments in which we operate and our growth has been supported by structural demand for our strategies and secular tailwinds for those markets. We strive to generate strong growth in periods where market conditions are favorable, like in 2021. But importantly, to be able to offer strong and differentiated growth in much tougher environments like 2022 and 2023. I think we have certainly done that. We grew FRE and DE 25% this past year following over 40% growth in both metrics in 2022. In the last two years, AUM has increased by over 75% and the over $50 billion we've added in equity and fee eligible debt over that period, represents over 80% of our starting fee paying AUM. This robust growth has allowed us to return significant capital to our shareholders. And today, we announced our annual fixed dividend for 2024 of $0.72, or $0.18 per quarter. This dividend represents a 29% step-up from 2023, which follows a 22% dividend increase from 2022. Since our listing in May of 2021, total return for our shareholders has been over 60%. These are impressive results in any market environment, and much more so given the conditions that we've observed. Well, there are a multitude of successes across the business that I'd love to highlight. I'll call out just a few that I think represent the advances we are making at Blue Owl. In spite of the very difficult backdrop for real estate fundraising, our latest triple net lease fund was the single largest U.S. real estate fund raised in 2023. We expect to exceed our hard cap of $5 billion, more than doubling the size of the predecessor fund. Furthermore, our overall real estate platform performed admirably on both a relative and absolute basis, returning 9% for the year. In GP stakes, we saw robust investor demand and deployment pipeline, resulting in an initial close of over $2 billion for our sixth GP minority equity stakes fund, earlier than originally anticipated, and despite having just held our final close for Fund V at the end of 2022. In addition, we announced a joint venture with Luna in Abu Dhabi-based global alternative investment manager to provide growth capital to leading midsized private capital GPs. This will supplement our dominant position as a capital provider to large GPs, and we feel this partnership will create a powerful and differentiated proposition for mid-market managers. In private wealth, the resources we've invested into scaling the business continue to pay dividends with Blue Owl remaining a top fundraiser in both the non-traded BDC and rechannels. Gross flows from our perpetually offered products were $1.9 billion during the fourth quarter, 65% higher than the first quarter. Inflows have been six times greater than redemption requests, both in the quarter and for the last 12 months. And we think we are just getting started as far as what's possible in wealth over time. Finally, couple of weeks ago, Blue Owl Capital Corporation III, or OBDE, successfully listed on the New York Stock Exchange, delivering liquidity to those investors as promised. OBDE is the second of our BDCs to become a publicly traded company, and this listing follows the remarkable 2023 results of our first publicly traded BDC, OBDC, which returned 40% in 2023. Our focus remains on providing our direct lending investors flexibility and optionality through product structure, while retaining the excellent credit quality, attractive income, downside protection and scale benefits that Blue Owl is known for. Moving on to business performance. In credit, we again saw booming trends in deployment in the fourth quarter with a constructive environment so far in 2024. Repayments were somewhat elevated, providing additional opportunities to redeploy capital. As Alan will detail, direct lending metrics remain strong, with no notable changes to the health of our portfolio companies. We remain at 6 basis points of annualized realized loss since inception, which has been more than offset by realized gains and the underlying revenue and EBITDA growth of the portfolio are robust at low double digits on average. We are well positioned to benefit from incremental sponsor-driven activity and growing market share. In our GP Stakes business, we continue to witness the resilience of larger cap GPs, with the market share gains of these managers accelerating during more challenging fundraising environments. This phenomenon has been consistent across asset classes. And combined with LPs continuing to allocate more to alternatives broadly translates to the impressive growth we have seen in our partner managers. In addition, we are witnessing a rising pace of consolidation across alternatives, further substantiating the value of scale in this industry and creating incremental tailwinds for the investments in our funds. In real estate, we continue to actively deploy capital at attractive cap rates close to 8% and have consistently monetized at meaningful spreads to our entry points. The scale benefits of our triple net lease strategy allow us to offer attractive risk return for essentially investment-grade secured credit, and this has resonated well with our investors looking for steady income enhanced live appreciation potential. Our more recent real estate funds have invested heavily into the demand created by the on-shoring movement. With geopolitical tensions and supply chain issues continuing to dominate headlines, companies have elevated on-shoring to the top of their priority list. This $1 trillion opportunity represents, in our view, not a moment in time, but a transformational manufacturing renaissance in the US. The capital needs driven by this theme, combined with more constrained capital availability at large have created a very strong pipeline into which we continue to deploy capital. We're very pleased with the outcomes we've achieved across Blue Owl in 2023. Looking ahead, there are a number of growth avenues we are pursuing to supplement the expansion of our existing platforms. We intend to launch a strategy focused on triple net lease in Europe, driven by deal flow we already see today. Our strategic equity strategy held a first close and committed to its first investment during the fourth quarter, and we expect that we'll continue to expand our alternative credit strategy. And in addition to further expanding our institutional and wealth distribution, we continue to evaluate ways to partner with other large long-duration pools of capital, such as insurance. Generally, we intend to grow organically where we have institutional expertise and the conviction to grow into market leadership. And we will look to acquire, where we can benefit from immediate scale and strategic positioning. I speak to the entire team in saying, we are very excited about what lies ahead for the business, and there's a lot to look forward to. With that, let me please turn it to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. To start off, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Mark mentioned this, but I'd like to reiterate that this is our 11th consecutive quarter of both management fee and FRE sequential growth, the only alternative asset manager that has demonstrated this over this period. And along with that, as we show on slide 5, we've been able to grow our dividend 57% over the past two years, driven solely by recurring and growing management fees. Let's go through some of the key highlights of our 2023 results on a full year comparative basis. Management fees were up 26% and 92% of these management fees are from permanent capital vehicles. FRE is up 25%, and our FRE margin is right on top of our 60% target, which we continue to expect to be the target for the next few years, and DE is up 25%. To double-click on this a little bit, as Mark mentioned earlier, we built our business with the intention of driving strong growth, not only during favorable market conditions, but more importantly, in tougher environments, like we've seen over the past year or so. And we believe the fact that we were able to generate 25-plus percent growth across these key metrics when peers on average generated low-teens management fee growth and DE declines over the past year, is a testament to how we are proving out our model. Now I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts. As you can see on slide 12, we raised $6.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $15.8 billion for the full year. Inclusive of debt capital, we raised $25 billion in 2023. I'll break down the fourth quarter numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised over $2.5 billion. This includes $1.9 billion raised in our diversified and first lien lending strategies with $1.2 billion raised in our non-traded BDC, OCIC, up 30% quarter-over-quarter. The remainder was raised across software lending and our newly launched strategic equity strategy. In GP Strategic Capital, we had an initial close of $2.1 billion for our sixth minority equity stakes funds as well as over $400 million in a co-investment fund for this strategy. In real estate, we raised approximately $1.1 billion with over $650 million for the sixth vintage drawdown fund, which brings that fund to $4.7 billion and over $350 million in our non-traded REIT, ORENT, up roughly 20% quarter-over-quarter. We are starting to see early signs of production coming from the distribution platforms that added ORENT in late 2023 and look forward to expanding our presence further on each, while also adding incremental platforms in 2024. As Mark alluded to earlier, the over $50 billion of fee-paying AUM we have added since Jan 1, 2022, represents over 80% growth in our fee-paying AUM since the end of 2021. While that number is notable in it of itself, I have to emphasize that this is also AUM that is largely permanent capital, so these assets will stay in our system and be the next layer in our layer case. During the quarter, we raised $4.6 for every dollar that was paid out as a result of distributions or redemptions. For context, last quarter, our peers on average raised $1.7 for every dollar that was paid out. And in addition to the staying power of existing AUM and the benefit of ongoing fundraising, we have substantial embedded earnings that we will unlock over time. AUM not yet paying fees was $14.5 billion at December 31, and corresponding to roughly $200 million of incremental annual management fees once deployed. Separately, we had also previously talked about another $200-plus million of incremental management fees that would turn on upon the listing of our private BDCs over time. And as many of you know, one of those BDCs did, in fact, list recently. OBDE's listing translates to approximately $80 million of that $200-plus million of additional annual management fees to Blue Owl. Moving on to our credit platform. We had gross originations of $8.1 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $3.2 billion. This brings our gross originations for 2023 and to $17.6 billion with $8.2 billion of net funded deployment. Our credit portfolio returned 4% in the fourth quarter and almost 18% in 2023. The weighted average LTVs remain in the low-40s across direct lending and in the low-30s specifically in our software lending portfolio. For our GP strategic capital platform, total invested commitments for our fifth GP stakes fund, including agreements in principle or over $11 billion of capital with line of sight into over $2 billion of opportunities, which if all signs would bring us through the remaining capital available in Fund V. And performance across these funds remained strong with a net IRR of 24% for Fund III, 43% for Fund IV and 17% for Fund V, which compare favorably to the median returns for private equity funds of the same vintages. And in our real estate platform, deployment activity remains robust with over $600 million deployed during the quarter, and our pipeline of opportunities remains strong with nearly $6 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract to close. With regards to performance, we achieved gross returns across our real estate portfolio of 9% in 2023 comparing very favorably to the broader real estate market as a result of our distinctive net lease strategy and the timing of capital deployment. The net lease structure insulates our returns from the expense inflation that many are experiencing, while the long duration and contractual rent escalators on our leases shield our portfolio from the declining rent growth trends that others across the industry are seeing. And most of our recent funds were raised and are being deployed into a capital scarce environment, which presents attractive risk-adjusted opportunities. Okay. I'd like to end with a couple of comments on tax rates and FRE margins to set the stage for 2024 and beyond. On taxes, the headline here is we expect our effective tax rate to be lower for longer. We saw the impact of various tax benefits, keeping our effective tax rate for 2023 at a low 2%. For 2024, we are currently expecting that rate to be in the mid-single digits, say, 5% and for 2025, we expect a high single-digit effective tax rate. We will be making our first cash TRA payment in the first quarter of 2024, which should result in an elevated rate in the mid-teens, say, 15%. For that quarter alone, before stepping down in the subsequent three quarters to approximately 2%, averaging for 2024, the roughly 5% I just noted. And on FRE margins, I've spoken frequently about our 60% FRE margin, which we feel very comfortable operating in the business for the next few years and is among the best in the industry. Let's talk a bit more about why this is the right level for us. We're putting very valuable R&D dollars back into the business, investing in the future so that we can continue to lead the industry in revenue growth. So for every follow-on product launch that helps us scale our business, like our sixth real estate funds or GP stakes fund, we have a new product we're launching like strategic equity or European net lease. We're also putting those valuable R&D dollars into continuing to grow and expand our wealth and institutional fundraising efforts. All the while, we're not sacrificing growth for FRE margin, our revenue and dividend growth is among the best in the industry. With that, I'd like to thank everyone who has joined us on the call today. Operator, can we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello, there.\nMark Lipschultz: Hi, there. Good morning.\nGlenn Schorr: Good morning. So I love all the growth, and I love the outlook stuff. You're doing everything that you said you were going to do. I know we've talked about this before, but I like hearing it continue. Your confidence in Owl defending its big fee premium, you do get paid well for what you do. You are putting up good returns, but your fees are towards the high side of the peer group. So can we just talk through that a little bit? Thank you.\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. Well, without sounding snarky at all, I mean, look, to a degree of property, you get what you pay for. I mean, we are offering an exceptional result with exceptional performance. And we have, very importantly, when you look at the average fee rate, and you know this, we have always been focused on the quality of our AUM, the quality of what we take on. And so as we've talked about before, we really don't focus on gathering AUM because that is exactly how you drive your average fee rates down. You can depend whether that's good, bad or otherwise. But the reality is that we focus on where we can generate really high value-added returns for investors and therefore, high value, high fee income for Blue Owl. So at the end of the day, you can grow a lot of AUM at ever lower fees or you can say, look, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take lesser AUM, relatively speaking, and I'm going to deliver really high-value results on that and get paid for it. So I think we also look at the end of the day, our pioneering different strategies where we can add that value. And again, people are willing to pay for that appropriately so take tech, right? We were really very, very early with the idea of focusing on software lending. And I can remember Clear's Day and the number of people that said, well, why would you do that? And sitting here today, again, I don't say that with any arrogance or anything. But I think at the end of the day, today, I was like, well, of course, software loans are where you want to be. Well, we started that years ago and have pioneered that space. And so I think that's really the way we do it by having distinctive strategies, having really a direct angle on triple net lease when everybody else's real estate products are suffering this year we have a thriving real estate product is a differentiated strategy. So that's really the heart and soul of it. But at the end of the day, we got to keep delivering value for our investors, delivering great results. We know that and we plan to.\nGlenn Schorr: And can you update us on timing on healthcare, given Cowen and this conversation I would think that health care product is right in line with this congo?\nMarc Lipschultz: Well, the healthcare product certainly is in line and -- or put it another way, let me contextualize the Cowen acquisition. Healthcare has been another very active sector for us. And we have done, I think, about $11 billion actually of loans and investments in healthcare including an ever expanded level of activity in royalties, which, again, you saw this year. And adding Cowen brings us yet another set of adjacent capabilities extremely deep on better the earlier part of that cycle and in particular, more of the pharma side, the science side. We have a series of PhDs that are part of that team that really understand the science on drug development, and that's additive to where we've been more in healthcare services and in things like structured solutions for, as I said, royalties and the like. And so now we have a full suite, full life cycle of capabilities. And by the way, as you've seen, the Cowen team has outstanding results, and they're really in a very, very interesting innovative area where they've dramatically outperformed their peers. So we now have all those pieces together. We see two big areas for growth. Healthcare is absolutely one of them. We've been starting to talk to investors. Again, we have to make sure we can come up with exactly the right structure, exactly the right product to your good first question. We have to do it in a way that's distinctive in a way that really adds value. We think we've got the pieces of that puzzle and now we've got to finish assembling that. So healthcare certainly has a meaningful analog to that tech story of six years ago. And then alternative credits, the other area, which I just Jason, while we're talking about it, this area outside of the traditional sponsor credit, we've really been developing a lot of capabilities in-house on things like ABL and airplane leasing, and that's another rich area that we're focused on. We think about credit opportunities for healthcare and alternative credit.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks for all that, Marc.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So the real estate business has had some terrific growth \u2013 growth since you acquired Oak Street at the end of 2021, with AUM up about 80% in just two years. And then the outlook is pretty bright as well. Mark and the team have done a terrific job here. But one thing that stands out to me is their ability to source transactions and just the absolute level of deal flow. So -- can you talk about the size of the investment team today? What's their capacity from an origination perspective? And ultimately, how much AUM can the business support over time?\nMarc Lipschultz: Well, Mark Zahr has done a spectacular job. So if I could -- thank you, Brian, and I'll join you in commending our partner there, really has architected a unique business model, which durability and attributes, of course, shine through this year. The business, as you know, with our new fund, we have now raised $5 billion, that's twice the size of the last fund, the largest fund, real estate fund in the US this entire year. And I will tell you that deployment is already off to a strong start. We already have hundreds of millions of dollars in LOIs and over 1 billion -- I'm sorry, in transactions and over $1 billion in LOIs -- so right at this moment, I would say we're probably pacing ahead of the ordinary pace of our product. And the demand is high because it's an alternative solution to capital needs for large corporate users and much like private credit, there's this element of adaptation, people finding the product and ultimately using it in more disruptive markets like people have experienced over the last year, you get more people thinking about innovative ways to finance. And so we have, right, at this point, our overall backlogs are really running at record highs in terms of all the things in our pipeline, over $10 billion. So we have plenty to focus on. And of course, also as we continue to extend that reach into Europe. So I don't want to say there's no constraint. I mean if you think about the massive amount of critical real estate owned by investment-grade institutions around the world. I mean that is a very, very large -- and it's mostly a white space. It's just not an area that's transacted. So I'm not suggesting that every company is going to do it with every asset or even close -- but if you kind of take a step back and contextualize what amounts to, of course, the biggest fund in this market are versus that marketplace. We're a fragment. So I don't think addressable market is in any manner a constraint. But we've got to keep going out there and finding the best product and developing the partnerships and proving that, that's a really innovative and effective way for these companies to finance. But clearly, people like Amazon have made that choice, and there's plenty of others that we have worked with that are likewise doing it. And last point, I guess I'd add is this new onshoring move, onshoring trend, which, of course, everyone is well aware of is going to be a potentially huge driver for this asset class. The amount of money that's being spent just right now on developing semiconductor production in the US. These are gigantic fab plants, for example. And the capital intensity, I think I was just reading that Sam Altman wants to raise some number of trillions of dollars to develop chip capacity, every one of those things is a giant new facility. And in a world of -- not going to be so easy to find trillions of dollars of capital, you certainly don't have to own the real estate. So we've been very active in dialogues with chip companies, for example, and what a great asset for us, a core institutional asset that's going to run for a very long time, big dollars with many, many wonderful credit counterparties. So I -- we appreciate every day we have to work hard to find the best investments, but addressable market is sizable, pipeline is very active right now. And then as I mentioned, a Europe as a whole another rich vein that we're continuing and working on how to mine best, because the companies we work with are global and they have real estate in Europe and they ask us about their real estate in Europe. So that's another leg of growth from our point of view.\nBrian McKenna: Super helpful. Thanks, Marc and congrats on another great quarter.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you very much.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to -- maybe zooming out a little bit. I just want to talk about fundraising a little bit more broadly. You guys had a really nice momentum exiting the year. And it's important to note, I think, that the flows are becoming a little bit more balanced between both channels and products. So, as you're looking out into 2024, what is sort of the aspirations for fundraising for the firm as a whole and more importantly, how should we think about the breadth of the flows that you're expecting to see next year?\nMarc Lipschultz: Thanks, Alex. And in the insightful phrasing of your question is on aspirations, I just want to start with, which is fourth quarter did indeed reflect, I think something important about the continuing evolution of the business, both in having the several adjacent legs and having several adjacent strategies, staying very much in our northbound highway. So to be clear, we have a strategy that is not all things all people back to the beginning of this conversation. But we do have more arrows in that quiver. And so what we saw, well, set in the fourth quarter was all of that starting to kind of show up in 1Q. Now I'm very cautious about focus in each quarter. We don't manage our business quarter-to-quarter. Fundraising, as you obviously know, is very episodic quarter-to-quarter just based on mandates and flagships and exact timing of product launches. So try to manage that way or sort of guess that way, but what you did see in the fourth quarter, which I think we will see repeat itself more is this breadth between products. We have significant fundraising in credit. We have significant fundraising in real estate, and we have significant fundraising in GP Stakes, and we will continue to -- we expect to see that in 2024. Again, we now have more multiple product points of access at multiple products. And then between wealth and institutional, likewise, we've got both very much developing plenty of room to run. There's our -- real estate continues to offer a product, which is the only net inflow real estate product in the marketplace, is still only on a very few number of platforms, and we're just have and are launching on many new platforms this year to offer that product. So I think that composition is exactly kind of the building block into 2024. Again, there's always going to be the ebbs and flows of when a new flagship comes in or when we launch on a new platform, but I think we do feel like we're in a good place heading into 2024 in the balance between products and between channels. And wealth continues to be strong for us and institutional continues to be strong. We've seen some of those SMAs. We've long talked about start to actually convert and credit, and those are big chunky numbers as well.\nAlex Blostein : Great. Thank you. And then one strategic question for you guys, actually, a bit of a two-parter, but I promise they're sort of related. On the balance sheet, so you mentioned insurance and you guys are looking to explore insurance opportunities for the firm. How do you think about structuring that? How do you think about minority ownership, majority ownership insurance companies that's kind of part one. And again, sort of related to the balance sheet, I saw you guys launched taking minority stakes with an asset manager and Abu Dhabi, maybe a little counterintuitive just given the fact that, that's what Dyal sort of does, obviously, a bigger scale. But why not do the strategy out of GP Solutions? What's the strategy behind partnering and doing a JV? Thanks.\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure, and appreciate both questions. So, first, with regard to insurance, look, it's an area that we have been for years, spending time on trying to develop a appropriate strategy. So let's start with this. We have two terrific channels of capital access that we talked about today, wealth and institutional, traditional institutional. The one we don't have that, obviously, some of our peers have done so well with is insurance. We're aware of that. We've been working on that pretty thoughtfully. We may not be able to develop the right solution, but it's something we're focused on adding to bring that third key leg in that again, most others have developed. From our point of view, we're going to stay true to our strategy. Look, we are in the asset management business. We are balance sheet light. Both of those will remain our focus. We do not aspire to own an insurance company, we aspire to become an insurance company, people have different strategies, so we're not opining on anybody else's strategy have been enormously successful for other people. That's not our strategy. So, our strategy is much more about how do we access asset management the insurance channel in a balance sheet light way. So that's really where our focus is. And it will continue to be an intense focus, maybe an ever more intense focus, as we head into 2024. And as we've now really gotten our other acquisitions integrated, and you can see kind of the cylinders firing in the fourth quarter. With regard to -- sorry, what was your second question? Oh, yes, the Luna JV.\nAlex Blostein : Luna JV.\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. So just to be clear on the architecture, this is part of our GP solutions product and back to this point about having adjacencies that are highly strategic and additive where we can add value for our investors in a distinct way. So today, as you know, we really are the market for large cap GP solutions. And in fact, that fund very much by design, focuses on large cap managers, the CBCs, the Veritas, the Silver Lakes. And so that's been an area where we've built a distinct network. We have our BSP, our operational support resources. And we love that space. And of course, we're in with our flagship where we got off to a good start in the fourth quarter. There's another arena that has not been our focus, which are these more higher -- well, it may not be higher growth actually because those firms we grow quite substantially. But younger firms or smaller firms that have a lot of ongoing potential or the so-called middle market. So hence, our advantage fund in combination with Lunate is our way of coming with a value-added solution to that market. In all our markets, again, I'll anchor back to what do we want to get paid for. We're going to get paid for delivering outstanding risk-adjusted results, you have to have a value proposition for that. Well, we are now coming to the middle market, so to speak, the growing marketplace there, and we're delivering two things with this partnership that are very distinctive. We're delivering our capabilities as, by far, the largest investor in GPs and the entire network that brings with it. And the operational resources, which are -- certainly been valuable to many of our large cap GPs, but think about the value and impact of those resources to a firm that can't afford to hold all those themselves, right? If you manage $50 billion, $100 billion you can have a whole lot of operational capabilities in-house. But when we manage $5 billion and growing our ability to bring our BSP at all that capability around how to kind of best practice and support growth, that's real value. That's something people should consider beyond price. And Lunate is a very big investor and intends to continue to be a big investor to the best of our understanding in private equity. So we also bring along someone who's going to have a very, very strong and obviously, positive view of anybody we partner with. So they'll make their own decision that goes with that, but we bring along this deep capital partner pool. So I think that brings us into a position to add real value in this middle market space, and we don't control that below $10 billion of AUM. So it's complementary. It's not -- it's really just filling out the pie, the puzzle, the going all the way across the spectrum.\nAlex Blostein: Great. All right. Thanks for all that.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Mark. Alan, I hope you're both doing well.\nMarc Lipschultz: Good morning. Thanks.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So we wanted to circle back on private wealth fundraising. So we had OCICs flows roughly doubling in the quarter, which is pretty impressive. And rent flows improved too, although a smaller amount, just given softer investor sentiment in real estate. But I wanted to see if you could comment on the sales trajectory of both products into early 2024. And it would also be helpful if you could provide an update on how many major platform shelves both products sit on today. And if you expect any major wirehouse or PB platform launches over the near term?\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. It's been a channel we've been after since day one. We're coming up on a decade, eight years, I guess, and we started trying to build into that channel. And it's obviously great to be able to see the benefits of that investment. We have a lot of people focused on this. We've spent a lot of time building trusted partnerships. So listen, we did have a very good fourth quarter, and that momentum continues. The wealth channel interest in these products. In no small part, I'll keep coming back to it. At the end of the day, it's about delivering performance. And if you look since inception and our OTIC product, it's delivered just about a 12% return. You look at our OCIC product, just about a 10% return. And our ORENT product delivering -- I mean, mammoth outperformance and stability with a 7% distribution rate that has tax advantages for many investors. So I always come back to that because that's the value-add part people hopefully are drawn to. So we continue to see great interest and growth in our core income and tech income products. That's on a lot of platforms. Now, I don't have all the numbers of platforms in front of me, so I can't answer that numerically, that's on a lot of platforms. There continue to be places that we work to penetrate. But I will say this, we've looked recently with one of our partner platforms. And you look, the penetration is still very low. The actual share of FAs who utilize the product is low. And frankly, the number of what so-called power users, the people that really use meaningful amounts of it. I mean that's really low. And so I think that speaks not just to Ball, that's the broader wealth channel. But I have looked at our stats, there's a lot to do inside of the existing platforms it say, our core income, our credit products, which are also the ones that are probably best understood today and most in favor for their attributes. The old [ph] rent piece, as you note, we had, again, certainly very nice growth which reflected just the continued organic interest and the addition, I think we may have had a platform or so last year. But now we are adding and already have added a couple of new platforms and we expect several more during the course of this year. And that is a kind of therefore, a dual opportunity as the -- as people learn more about the product, and there is a certain virtuous circle in this area as you get adaptation of the product, adoption of the product. And then here, we have new platforms that we're launching on as well. So, we view -- real estate has been our fastest-growing business, as you know, this last year in in assets. And we continue to look at real estate as the potential to be our fastest-growing business because of the distinctive model we have and the adjacencies, we're still working into both channels of distribution, things like geography, I mentioned. Europe, when we think ahead, we think about we're deep in credit. We're deep in real estate. We've talked about this before, real estate credit, it would be literally filling in something we have enormous strength in. So, I think we're quite enthused about real estate and the opportunity, especially given the disruption. Last thing I'll say you said this very, very wisely. There is a -- for a good reason, a very negative sentiment about real estate. So, we have to kind of sell through the up. You said those two words and then get down to number, wait, yes, it's a disruptive category, but here is the way you succeed in it. And that's actually showing in this manner, we're getting great cap rate purchases today, right? There's a bit of the baby at water where people are saying, real estate, but that's rated by our measure, a triple net lease warehouse to an investment-grade client if we get the uplift of just negative sentiment therefore, higher cap rates, we'll take it.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Marc, if I can add to that on the institutional side because we obviously have a very strong wealth platform. We also have a very strong institutional platform. We're expecting a very strong year on the institutional side as well. We've got a number of products. And we saw 4Q, we saw a very strong institutional numbers come in 4Q. We were already off to a strong start in 1Q this year already in institutional. And when you think about the breadth of 2024 and what we have out there, we have multiple products in the credit business. We have our strategic equity product. We have diversified lending strategies, first lien fund strategies. We've obviously got GP Stakes Fund VI. We just did a very big initial close, but we have a long way to go here in 2024 and 2025, and we have some existing and new products in the real estate space that we think are going to be very interesting to institutional clients.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thanks Alan. Just for my follow-up on Dyal V. I recall the fundraising for this fund being very kind of bar belled with some big raises in the beginning and some at the end, a little hold out in the middle. Do you expect Dyal VI as raises to be more consistent? I know you just had about $2 billion in 4Q, but something like $2 billion every quarter or two until you get to that $13 billion target. And then I know you launched a new middle markets fund, should there be a first close for that over the near-term?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. So happy to take that. On your last point, we did an initial close with Lunate, so that we just got a press release out just in the last 24 or 36 hours.\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. I should have mentioned, they're making also a large anchor commitment to the product when I was kind of listing the attributes here gets us right out of the gates, but sorry.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: No, not at all. And so we've got some -- we've got our first close there done. And we have a road ahead to continue to raise that product. We think there's going to be a lot of excitement and interest over that product. It's going to take some time to raise the product just like GP Stakes Fund VI. For Fund VI, we don't expect it to be barbelled like what we saw with Fund V that was right in the middle of when we did our listing for Blue Owl. And so we think it will be more of a straight line there. Look, it's going to ebb and flow a little between institutional and wealth. And so you'll see one quarter, a little stronger institution, one quarter, a little stronger wealth. It may take some time for us to get on all the wealth platforms that we'd like to. Don\u2019t forget for Fund V, we were really on one large platform. It was a big private bank. Now we have the ability to bring all the Blue Owl all relationships to the table here and really get out on a lot more wealth platform. So we're very excited about that. And on the institutional side, if you recall, when we brought all these businesses together, we had single-digit percent overlap amongst our investor bases across our three businesses. Now we have the opportunity to cross-sell across all of those investors. And so we're very excited about that as well, Craig.\nMarc Lipschultz: But look, it's still as all alternative products, but certainly this one. It definitely has a bit of a front-end load and a back-end load. So -- we don't want to -- it will not be $2 billion the quarter. It's nowhere near that linear. Everyone on this -- everyone listening here knows the natural lumpiness of different timings of close. So, we did have a particular attribute in Fund V with the acquisition at that time and then the IPO. So we don't have that. But I think you should still anticipate more get first close done. It's -- there's some period of time before we then do another close and then some period of time before you get to another close. So it will not be linear, but it will -- it should be quite as hold out in the middle.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Marc.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much taking the questions. Just coming back to direct lending. It's been a theme that's been sort of coming up through the entire earnings season. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on volume as well as pricing outlook for the direct lending platform to the extent that competition picks up, appreciate that maybe there's more unit growth out there. But nonetheless, I'd be particularly curious on how you sort of see the pricing side of things developing? Thank you.\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. It's certainly been and continues to be a very good environment for direct lending. So said a lot of people are talking about it, Kyle. I'm not chuckling, but it's a little bit on how much attention all under wants to talk about private credit, whether that is, in fact, a large part of their strategies or not. But we're happy about it. We're happy to -- we're perfectly satisfied have a day in the sun. We also get that everything gets and stay in the sun. So look, we've been at this for a long time and are going to be at it for a very long time, delivering for our users, a capital solution in scale and in tailored fashion and doing that in a way that is reliable to them, and we don't compete with them in private equity. So I think we do have a distinct architecture here. And with all that said, look, it's a good environment today. I think to call it what it is, the economy is sound. We can all have different views and of course, about where we'll be in 6 months and 12 months. I will tell you that, if you look at the performance of our portfolio, this -- the lag with the last full quarter, we have able to report from all our portfolio companies. Our revenue and EBITDA growth were higher than the prior quarter. In point of fact, the EBITDA growth on average across the platform was 15%. So now we obviously focus on some very, very attractive industries, attractive businesses with the biggest backers, I don't measure suggesting that's indicative of the economy or broadly all portfolios, but it does tell me we've got a very healthy portfolio. And certainly, not an unhealthy economy, and I think actually would be a good reason to think we have a pretty solid economy at this point from the micro -- we're not macro experts from the micro up here in the US. So that's good. We continue to have strong demand. And from what I understand, and again, you all have better insights into this. But if you talk to the M&A community, they're seeing a lot of activity picking up here as we go into the first quarter. Those are natural cyclicality to all things that are M&A related, which is to say fourth quarter is obviously always a big quarter because people are finishing things and then first quarter, be able to restart these new processes. So setting aside the natural timing. I think we feel like the sentiment is very strong. So the outlook to us feels very good in terms of likely activity this year. There's $2.5 trillion of private equity dry powder. And they obviously had a very tepid activity year last year. So I think we imagine that in a world that looks like this, expect there'll be a lot more activity. And more activity would be the one thing I would have liked to have in direct lending, it would be just more aggregate market activity. We love the credits. We love what we're getting done. We love our position and market share. But aggregate activity is still ultimately a boundary condition. So hopefully, and it seems reasonable to expect 2024 should be a more active year and we'll gladly take that. So finally, to come on to your question about spreads competition. So it's true, of course, that more dollars have been raised in private credit, but no more in proportion than historically to private equity. And in fact, private equity obviously has been accumulating assets here that now have to get deployed. And so I think we feel like the market remains generally in balance and looking out, again, anticipating more activity we can't meet the needs of all the capital markets. We need the liquid markets to return to have a fully functioning capital market environment. And so while 2022, of course, it's a wonderful time for credits and spreads, and there was no meaningful public market, hopefully, what we'll have is more activity and a functioning public market. But overall, that big iron take spreads have come down from their peaks, we certainly saw them come back in from particularly wide levels. And that's okay. Remember, we operated in exactly that environment just a couple of years ago. We're still getting paid really well by our measure, look, our -- since inception, we've done over $80 billion in loans, and our running loss rate has been 6 basis points. And in fact, that's been more than offset by realized gains. So for that kind of underlying credit performance, our ability to deliver double-digit returns. I mean, of course, we'll take a wider spread if we can have it, but we have a very attractive risk return proposition as we originate today. And in the large end of the market, parting comment is, a lot of the activity in the articles and of course, are new entrants, to your point, it's like the trendy topic. But that's a different part of the market we're in. We're in this pyramid that Doug has talked about before. At the top of the pyramid, we're doing the largest companies with the largest sponsors, which we like for credit reasons, not some other reason really headlines and the like, it's better credits in our view. That remains the domain of a handful of people, many of whom have raised a lot of money. So the dollars -- if you look at the dollar flows, a lot of the dollars are in the hands of the same handful of people that had them before. So the top of the pyramid isn't really changing meaningfully. The bottom of the pyramid, there's definitely been a lot of new people jocking down there. It's not where we operate.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you. I didn\u2019t meant to interrupt you. So my second question, Alan, for you, one housekeeping item, one bigger picture question within that. The transaction line was particularly strong, because wondering if you could flesh out maybe what was going behind that. But the broader question is, you mentioned the 60% margin, which certainly is quite strong, and you continue to reinvest back into the business. A number of your peers who have started much later than Blue Oil in terms of trying to get particularly into the wealth management business have spent heavily in sort of signaling that they're on the other side of that investment spend cycle. I'm just sort of wondering if you could just unpack a little bit what's behind the still elevated spending for Blue Owl and then how quickly do you think that, that could ramp up production as an offset? Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thanks, Bill. So on the transaction fees, we've talked in the past about that generally follows the trend of gross originations, they don't follow lockstep. So we could have a bigger quarter, one quarter and a little lower transaction fees in next quarter. 4Q was our second biggest ever growth origination quarter. So we had -- following that, we had a very strong transaction fee quarter. On the 60% margin, look, we will -- we talk a lot about not being complacent in the industry and we're going to continue to put very valuable dollars back into fundraising. And we're focused on both institutional and wealth in those regards. And we have a very built-out institutional and wealth fundraising teams. We want to continue to grow that. We want to continue to expand. We want to expand both in the US, we want to expand both around the world for institutional and for wealth. So we're going to continue to invest dollar in that. We're also launching new products. And so when you think about each scale product, I think I talked about in my remarks, every big scale product that we raise like a real estate Fund VI or GP Stakes Fund VI. We have other new products we're launching that have much lower margins. And so everything blends back to that 60% that we see for the next few years.\nBill Katz: Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. I wanted to ask on the Cowen Healthcare acquisition, which you gave some great color in response to an earlier question just on the broader strategy. It gives you a great foothold in healthcare life sciences space. But what I was hoping to get a better sense of is how quickly you could scale the strategy. Should we think about it following a similar growth trajectory to some of your tech-focused funds? Or could it be even faster just given greater brand recognition, better distribution capabilities that you have today?\nMarc Lipschultz: Well, look, we certainly see a meaningful opportunity. These things take time to develop well and right and to be able to develop the value add. And so look, tech has been extraordinary, and I -- we're lucky and we appreciate that we were able to create that opportunity. I wish that was somehow the future of health care and maybe someday, it will. I don't think that's the template we would have in mind. I think this is about methodically building across the platform. It's already an area we're very active and to be clear. As I said, we've already done $11 billion of investments in this arena. So I think it's too early to really give you a lot of direction on scale and timing, but it is safe to say it's an area we're very focused on developing our platform. Tech, I think, was a pretty special case. It is true we have a much more developed infrastructure and much more developed platform and a much more developed set of LPs. But software is such a mega trend, and we were so early with that. I think that was pretty special. But this is definitely an exciting opportunity. I'm talking about another huge part of the economy in health care is certainly it. And we now have a complete set from life sciences to structured solutions to health care services capabilities. So we're going to work on it, and we'll certainly keep you all posted as we develop.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nMarc Lipschultz: And by the way, I love the -- nothing blue about 72 in your flash note. Thank you for that.\nAlex Blostein: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi, good morning everyone.\nMarc Lipschultz: Good morning.\nPatrick Davitt: This view out there that like middle market lending is less exposed to bank disintermediation and deal activity than the larger market where you play. So in that vein, what are you guys seeing in terms of that give and take between new deal volume and refinancing outflows from larger borrowers as the broadly syndicated and high-yield market opens back up?\nMarc Lipschultz: So whether it's less susceptible to bank, I mean, at the end of the day, the flow lines have been away from the traditional syndicated market toward us, not the other way back, of course, as you know, it's certainly true. You're not going to take small companies and do syndicated loans. But that's kind of part of the problem with the nature of those credits and the scalability. We always get offered brought these smaller transactions. And listen, nothing -- not a one size fits all, but I can tell you on average, the credits are nowhere near as good and the terms are no better. So I genuinely don't understand the argument for the smaller cap alone strategy. It's a perfectly fine strategy. But somehow, I don't know if you want to try to position us, oh, here's an advantage over large cap. There isn't an advantage. That doesn't mean it's not a perfectly good business. With regard to banks and the flows, so you make a really good point. There's two forces at work, and they'll show up in different ways at different times, which is the return of some functioning liquid market, and I think we are seeing the return of some function in liquid market. Again, with the kind of the Asterix on I'll say, we're happy about that. I mean we need that to have a good functioning and vibrant marketplace. The abstracts, is of course, it's nice when the market is entirely in the private hands. But that's not a bad dynamic in aggregate. And then, there's going to be this by directional point when those liquid markets return, of course, that means that's going to be an option for users when it wasn't an option. But remember, that was a wide open option in 2021, when we were thriving and having some of our biggest origination periods, which kind of speaks to the point that activity meets our value proposition, ends-up often being the net positive even when there's, other people bumping around or even very active in the market. And what's happened over the last several years. And we've talked about this, I think, on a lot of the calls, once people try using the private solution, many, not all, decide that's absolutely what they want to do going forward. The value proposition of the 3Ps, Predictability, Privacy, Partnership, is something that has been now tested by many people. And they said, of course, it's true. And by the way, just I don't mean this to be, again, overly conclusive. I don't have anything like the knowledge every private equity investor asked, but I did do private equity for 20 years. And I can say this there is no private equity transaction that will work or not work from a return point of view because you paid a little bit more and we do charge more for the loan. And you had a stricter document. Look, if you're performing well, it won't matter if you have a stricter document. You get in trouble, it will matter. And that's of course, how we protect ourselves. And so at the end of the day, a lot of people, I think, are realizing the ease of execution having the predictability of Terms, having a truly Private Capital Structure, so I'm not dealing with quarterly reporting now to bondholders, instead of stockholders. And most importantly, that phone call, when times change for better or worse, that partnership preferably for better. And we've had a lot of that, people calling up and saying, \"Hey, can I add on what an opportunity in 2022. No one else can buy right now. I want to buy. Can you provide me capital?\" And our answer is, absolutely. So I think that will continue to thrive as an option. And then last, as you mentioned, there will be less, some things will go to the syndicated market. We are not suggesting otherwise, but something that in the syndicated market are going to come down, our market. As you have noted with your question and we've already seen that, right? We've done that with Finastra. We've done that with PetVet things that are coming out of that market, I would suggest there's probably a lot more opportunity for them to flow in that direction than people who have had a great experience in the Private Market saying, \"Oh, I'm really excited to be back to the market of having 100 different lenders when I can otherwise deal with one or two. So we take everybody seriously, and there's, great value propositions. The banks do a great job. I think we do a great job and a healthy ecosystem as both of us doing our job.\nPatrick Davitt: Very good. Helpful. A quick follow-up, the 15% EBITDA growth in the portfolio, obviously, great, but I assume that excludes the recurring revenue loans. So could you update us on what percentage of the portfolio is recurring revenue and how those borrowers are performing?\nMarc Lipschultz: Don't have the percentage in front of me. So I can't quite answer that, but I can say they're doing very well. That is to say that the Software area continues to be extremely healthy. We continue to be in a place where we have not yet had a loss on a software loan. In fact, we've not had a default on a software loan. And that continues to be true. So the recurring revenue loans are -- or those businesses continue to do very well. And when I think about the portfolio I would stand by what we concluded six years ago, software on average is -- are the best credit to the market, which is why we went there in the first place and why we go there now. So, the recurring revenue loans are doing very well. Remember, one other thing on recurring revenue loans, because again, for reasons I understand, it gets a lot of attention in the sort of, hey, that's not what people traditionally pictured. But recurring revenue loan in the context of a big SaaS company is a company that has a lot of revenue, a tremendous amount of gross profit, right, 80%, 90% margins. But is spending a lot of that to further grow their business and therefore, further grow those gross margin dollars at rates way above the average enterprise in the US, or elsewhere. As a lender to that company, you don't get to spend 50% of your revenues on marketing and sales, if you don't pay your interest bill. So I think one of the durability elements that has shown, and we bought to be true, and I think still though sometimes in this distinction, not to say it's lost, but I think it's undervalued. If I have $400 million of revenue and a 90% gross margin, I have $360 million to spend. And I may want to spend it all on growing my business. But I don't get to spend any of it until I pay for that 30%. And it's only on average by 30% and a fraction percent of my capital structure that Blue Owl has financed. So I feel very good about the stability of those positions, and we've experienced that when there have been questions raised. Those are some of the earliest people to say, no problem. We got you. Like let's just talk this through. And we love our company, and we want to keep growing. So how about we put up some more money? How about we come up with something that works for everybody.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Covered a lot this morning. So hopefully, my questions aren't too long here. I was curious about what has been from the listing so far, I know it's early days, but OBDE. Shares haven't traded that well. So curious whether or not that's impacted any of the reception? And maybe could you talk about any potential to consider a merger between some of the listed BDCs and what benefits those would bring to investors in those vehicles?\nMarc Lipschultz: Of course, one of your questions are certainly not too long. I think, we can all conclude there's any danger to my answers are too long. But we like to be transparent. So with that said, with regard to the listing, the listing has been extremely well received, and here's why. We told people when we create these private vehicles that we will, in an orderly basis in an appropriate amount of time, create the option, but not the obligation to -- for liquidity. People that had an illiquid position earning a wonderful return, now have a liquid position, earning a wonderful return. And so that one has to sell anything. And in fact, it remained, I don't say a mystery to us, but we certainly would prefer to many investors that are considering direct lending, why wouldn't you buy BDCs in the public market at a discount to their NAV? Now, there's a reason for that. Some people don't want that level of volatility. So back to the point, create the ecosystem, create different access points, different people have different preferences for how they want to invest. But it's a heck of a fine proposition. So, if you don't sell them these variances in trading really aren't going to matter, and you're going to get your dividends. But if you want to sell because you have other priorities, adjusted for wherever that price may be, then great. Now you have that option that doesn't exist in a traditional fund. So I think, it's been very well received because we -- for us, it's important to us to deliver on our commitments to our investors and our commitment was to deliver that option at the right time. So with regard to the possibilities going forward, mergers, maybe Alan, I'll turn it to you for that.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thank you, Mark. Brendan, thank you for the question. Look, we continue to evaluate the strategic options that are available to our BDC shareholders. On the diversified lending side, we have BDC2, we have BPC3, which is now OBDE. We could continue to have that it on the New York Stock Exchange. It could also be natural to over time, merge something like OBD into OBDC. But we continue to look at that and continue to talk to our shareholders. On the tech side, on the software lending side, we have two private, private to public BDCs, OTF and OTF 2. And we continue to evaluate options for those shareholders as well. We have OTF, which is fully invested, fully deployed. It's fully levered OTF II, we still are deploying some of the capital. We have not drawn down all the capital from our shareholders there. But over the course of this next year, we'll make a lot of progress there. And we'll continue to evaluate whether it makes sense to merge those two and then list them or to list one and then continue to look at that.\nBrennan Hawken: Got it. Thanks for that color. And then I know it was only three months ago, when you guys last spoke about the dividend and the potential risk to the dollar, but the environment does seem to be getting better. So you guys are putting up some nice growth in the dividend for this year. Has that risk to the dollar in 2025 diminished, given the improvement that you guys have seen in the environment? Or should we still consider those -- that outlook unchanged?\nMarc Lipschultz: Listen, we remain on track to deliver in or around dollar. And certainly, we've taken another really nice step, right? We've raised the dividend 29% to $0.72 and fundamentals in the business are strong. So every time we step closer, obviously, that feels good in trying to get there and deliver. And obviously, you can give us all collectively more comfort. There's still enough variables here in 2025 that we in and around, we pick on purpose. The dollar remains our target. We feel good about being in that range. I think the really important point I want to come back to here is that because of the predictability of our model, the stability and the growth we've now this year, grown kind of all our key metrics, 25%. And that's more than kind of double the average of our many of our peers when we look at results, which are all good results, an incredible organization. So we've done that in a highly predictable way. Remember also where we are right now is exactly where we all talked about a year ago. And that is true. I think what maybe is most distinct about our performance this year is not just the pure strength of it, which, I mean obviously, we're very pleased with, but also the consistency and predictability despite all the changes in the market. We don't have carry in our numbers. We did -- a lot of people have some really strong fourth quarters, but that was after people didn't expect things to be good in the fourth -- people didn't think there'd be much carry. So numbers came down. So I think that predictability gives us the following comfort. And every time you get closer, probably qualitatively a tighter band, the band around that dollar should be narrow. So our aim remains the dollar. We continue to see the pathway forward. But in any case, that band gets narrower and it should be within a narrow band given just the nature of our business.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: So Mark, what I'd love to do for folks, and hopefully, Brennan, you and your colleagues will find this helpful. When we think about, how do we paint the picture for you all of, how do you get to the $1 a share in your modeling. It's really straightforward, and it's not that many things that have to happen. It's just keeping that real focus on a handful of things to get to that goal. So when I think about 2023 revenues of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, we have another $1 billion of revenue that we have line of sight on. So what is that $1 billion? Some of that, by the way, about $400 million, $425 million of those revenues are not from raising any more equity fundraise dollars. And so we have a 25% growth in the 2023 revenues, just from taking our AUM not yet earning fees and deploying that, as well as the fee step-ups from our private to public BDCs. That's over $400 million that would represent 25% growth on our revenue line from 2023 without doing any fundraising whatsoever. Then when you add fundraising for just a few products, our GP Stakes VI product and our non-traded BDCs, OCIC and OTIC, that's another $450 million to $500 million of revenues over the next two years, right? So we've talked about GP Stakes VI. That's a two-year -- we're targeting 2024 and 2025. As Marc commented, as I commented earlier, that's going to ebb and flow a little between closes, but that's a total of a 60% revenue growth. And so when you think about what do we need to do to hit the $1 a share, we need to keep fundraising on the wealth side. We have to raise -- continue to raise non-traded products, CIC, TIC or -- all of those are key to this, fundraise for GP Stakes Fund VI. We've already listed OBDC III, now traded as OBDE. And then if we can list one, maybe both, but one of our software lending BDCs, there's an accretive M&A deal out there. We achieved our goal of $1 a share. It's not 12 things that have to happen. When you look out beyond 2025, obviously, we're putting a number of calls in the fire to continue that growth, and we've talked about the 60% FRE margin and how we're putting a lot of that R&D dollars back into the business to keep a very strong growth rate out beyond 2025. But it's a few things that have to happen for us to achieve that dollar a share dividend. It's going to take a lot of hard work, just to be clear, but it's not a lot of things that have to happen.\nBrennan Hawken: Thanks for that all the color. Very helpful.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Great. Thank you, Brennan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Crispin Love with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nCrispin Love: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Appreciate taking my questions. Just one question for me. On the European net lease product, can you talk a little bit more about that? Is that expected to be done all organically over time? And if there are any major differences between the European and the U.S. product other than the obvious?\nMarc Lipschultz : Yes, happy to. So Today, we do some opportunities in Europe, but we have a U.S.-centric product, obviously, in a U.S.-centric focus. But the companies we work with are global. And so they have regularly come off and said, hey, listen, this really great solution we have with you in the U.S., how about Europe? And periodically, we do one. But what we need now is a dedicated pool of capital to expand what we have available to be able to meet that need, and we'll do that through a structure that's appropriate for Europe. And so we're really following our customers, really following the demand and that demand is substantial. Is there a difference? Well, the similarities is they're very high-quality companies and in many cases, the same global enterprises, not obviously, in every case. So it expands our lens in terms of where we can work with our current customers. It expands the customers we can work with. The opportunity, therefore, for us is organic because we already are the leader in that market and have the distinctive skills. So this is an organic build an opportunity. Are there any real differences? The only thing when I talk to the team today, on average, the terms, that is to say the lease terms, the opportunities are probably a little better in Europe right now. So I'd say cap rates meet quality of credit, probably a little more attractive. But I don't know if that's statistically significant. At the end of the day, it's really doing what we do so well here and taking it to this marketplace and putting a structure that is optimized for doing so in Europe.\nCrispin Love: Great. Thank you. Appreciate for taking my question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Thanks very much. Alan, you answered my question with Brendan's question mostly. So I'm going to skip that one on go right to my follow-up. Maybe for Marc, you mentioned earlier in your prepared remarks about the rising consolidation in the alternative asset management business. Certainly, we've been seeing this -- maybe if you can just talk about how you see that impacting your GP solutions business, the opportunities that you can get from that, whether there's also within that vein, opportunities on the direct lending side, maybe combine the deal activity. And then just maybe thoughts around considering that thoughts around the potential for the -- turning on Fund VI of \u2013 and GP stakes, whether that's it sounds like that's probably more 2025 event, but I just wanted to check in on that.\nMarc Lipschultz: Absolutely. And thank you. The consolidation activity in alts is -- it's clearly noticeable, right? It's happening in a pretty material fashion, and it seems like there's continuing to be a lot of activity out there in terms of pending conversations, explorations people are having. And so a few implications of that. And your question hits right on probably the most substantial one, which is look, it's clearly a tailwind for our GP strategic capital business. And I say that, I guess, in two ways. Most importantly, I was coming back to how do we deliver great results for our investors, we own a vast number of stakes in GPs, some of whom will end up selling themselves to other consolidated tours or other big pods. We've already seen that, right? We've seen like a [indiscernible] get purchased, and that was a great result for us. Perhaps there'll be some more IPOs, that tends to be a good path for us over time. So that consolidation is a lift in the potential valuation and realization of value in all our prior GP funds. So again start there, that's good for our investors. It also presents new opportunities. Because on the other hand, you're also going to have people where there's one firm choosing to buy another and need capital to do it, right? So that's another great motivation for working with our GP strategic capital business is to provide the capital you might need to be one of the consolidators. And so that creates more demand. We're active on the GP stake side. We have a lot of active conversations. We're largely through the commitments, as you know, of investing Fund V. In fact, we even did a little bridge co-investment vehicle that we mentioned here before, just to kind of bring us from Fund V to now Fund VI, where we've done this close. So it should be an active area. It is clearly a favorable dynamic to have more consolidation activity, both for portfolio and for deal activity. So it's a positive, exactly how much of a positive we'll see as the year plays out, but it's a helpful trend. \nAlan Kirshenbaum: And on the Fund VI closing, just to close that out, Brian. We did our closing towards the end of the quarter. So we'll start to see a positive management fee impact starting in 1Q. \nQ \u2013 Brian Bedell: Great. Okay. Awesome. Thank you. \nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nQ \u2013 Ken Worthington: Hi, good morning. Hard to imagine there's any questions left, but I've got...\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Bring it home strong. \nQ \u2013 Ken Worthington: Yes. Real estate returns, you called out were negative in the quarter, triple net lease has held up really well versus other parts of the private real estate market this year and last year and the yield environment was sort of favorable in 4Q. So anything to kind of call out on the returns this quarter? Or what drove the negative. Thanks. \nMarc Lipschultz: So look, this has been a really wonderful durable strategy by design. I mean that is our reason to be. That's our value add and in high-risk on market, people it's hard to get that signal through the noise. And obviously, in this environment, the signal comes through loud and this is a brand that performs in all markets, and we've seen that here. As for the loss -- this very small loss this quarter. That was actually a portfolio has done really, really well. The slight negative for what it's worth to a mark-to-market on the debt in our real estate business. But I -- not to haggle which direction the aggregate result for the year is a pretty good template for where we are and where we've been. There was nothing peculiar about fourth quarter other than some peculiarities in this mark-to-market part, but nothing about performance. Performance remains extremely strong.\nQ \u2013 Ken Worthington: Excellent. Thank you. \nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Marc Lipschultz for any closing remarks. \nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you all for your time. We really do appreciate the patience here this morning and spending the time with us. And we look forward to continuing to drive hard. We have a lot of work ahead, but we are excited about the starting point for this year and the opportunities and conditions to keep driving forward in our mission and goal to try to get to that $1 a share in 2025. Have a good day.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, everyone. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. To start off, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Mark mentioned this, but I'd like to reiterate that this is our 11th consecutive quarter of both management fee and FRE sequential growth, the only alternative asset manager that has demonstrated this over this period. And along with that, as we show on slide 5, we've been able to grow our dividend 57% over the past two years, driven solely by recurring and growing management fees. Let's go through some of the key highlights of our 2023 results on a full year comparative basis. Management fees were up 26% and 92% of these management fees are from permanent capital vehicles. FRE is up 25%, and our FRE margin is right on top of our 60% target, which we continue to expect to be the target for the next few years, and DE is up 25%. To double-click on this a little bit, as Mark mentioned earlier, we built our business with the intention of driving strong growth, not only during favorable market conditions, but more importantly, in tougher environments, like we've seen over the past year or so. And we believe the fact that we were able to generate 25-plus percent growth across these key metrics when peers on average generated low-teens management fee growth and DE declines over the past year, is a testament to how we are proving out our model. Now I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts. As you can see on slide 12, we raised $6.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $15.8 billion for the full year. Inclusive of debt capital, we raised $25 billion in 2023. I'll break down the fourth quarter numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised over $2.5 billion. This includes $1.9 billion raised in our diversified and first lien lending strategies with $1.2 billion raised in our non-traded BDC, OCIC, up 30% quarter-over-quarter. The remainder was raised across software lending and our newly launched strategic equity strategy. In GP Strategic Capital, we had an initial close of $2.1 billion for our sixth minority equity stakes funds as well as over $400 million in a co-investment fund for this strategy. In real estate, we raised approximately $1.1 billion with over $650 million for the sixth vintage drawdown fund, which brings that fund to $4.7 billion and over $350 million in our non-traded REIT, ORENT, up roughly 20% quarter-over-quarter. We are starting to see early signs of production coming from the distribution platforms that added ORENT in late 2023 and look forward to expanding our presence further on each, while also adding incremental platforms in 2024. As Mark alluded to earlier, the over $50 billion of fee-paying AUM we have added since Jan 1, 2022, represents over 80% growth in our fee-paying AUM since the end of 2021. While that number is notable in it of itself, I have to emphasize that this is also AUM that is largely permanent capital, so these assets will stay in our system and be the next layer in our layer case. During the quarter, we raised $4.6 for every dollar that was paid out as a result of distributions or redemptions. For context, last quarter, our peers on average raised $1.7 for every dollar that was paid out. And in addition to the staying power of existing AUM and the benefit of ongoing fundraising, we have substantial embedded earnings that we will unlock over time. AUM not yet paying fees was $14.5 billion at December 31, and corresponding to roughly $200 million of incremental annual management fees once deployed. Separately, we had also previously talked about another $200-plus million of incremental management fees that would turn on upon the listing of our private BDCs over time. And as many of you know, one of those BDCs did, in fact, list recently. OBDE's listing translates to approximately $80 million of that $200-plus million of additional annual management fees to Blue Owl. Moving on to our credit platform. We had gross originations of $8.1 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $3.2 billion. This brings our gross originations for 2023 and to $17.6 billion with $8.2 billion of net funded deployment. Our credit portfolio returned 4% in the fourth quarter and almost 18% in 2023. The weighted average LTVs remain in the low-40s across direct lending and in the low-30s specifically in our software lending portfolio. For our GP strategic capital platform, total invested commitments for our fifth GP stakes fund, including agreements in principle or over $11 billion of capital with line of sight into over $2 billion of opportunities, which if all signs would bring us through the remaining capital available in Fund V. And performance across these funds remained strong with a net IRR of 24% for Fund III, 43% for Fund IV and 17% for Fund V, which compare favorably to the median returns for private equity funds of the same vintages. And in our real estate platform, deployment activity remains robust with over $600 million deployed during the quarter, and our pipeline of opportunities remains strong with nearly $6 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract to close. With regards to performance, we achieved gross returns across our real estate portfolio of 9% in 2023 comparing very favorably to the broader real estate market as a result of our distinctive net lease strategy and the timing of capital deployment. The net lease structure insulates our returns from the expense inflation that many are experiencing, while the long duration and contractual rent escalators on our leases shield our portfolio from the declining rent growth trends that others across the industry are seeing. And most of our recent funds were raised and are being deployed into a capital scarce environment, which presents attractive risk-adjusted opportunities. Okay. I'd like to end with a couple of comments on tax rates and FRE margins to set the stage for 2024 and beyond. On taxes, the headline here is we expect our effective tax rate to be lower for longer. We saw the impact of various tax benefits, keeping our effective tax rate for 2023 at a low 2%. For 2024, we are currently expecting that rate to be in the mid-single digits, say, 5% and for 2025, we expect a high single-digit effective tax rate. We will be making our first cash TRA payment in the first quarter of 2024, which should result in an elevated rate in the mid-teens, say, 15%. For that quarter alone, before stepping down in the subsequent three quarters to approximately 2%, averaging for 2024, the roughly 5% I just noted. And on FRE margins, I've spoken frequently about our 60% FRE margin, which we feel very comfortable operating in the business for the next few years and is among the best in the industry. Let's talk a bit more about why this is the right level for us. We're putting very valuable R&D dollars back into the business, investing in the future so that we can continue to lead the industry in revenue growth. So for every follow-on product launch that helps us scale our business, like our sixth real estate funds or GP stakes fund, we have a new product we're launching like strategic equity or European net lease. We're also putting those valuable R&D dollars into continuing to grow and expand our wealth and institutional fundraising efforts. All the while, we're not sacrificing growth for FRE margin, our revenue and dividend growth is among the best in the industry. With that, I'd like to thank everyone who has joined us on the call today. Operator, can we please open the line for questions? Thanks. Marc, if I can add to that on the institutional side because we obviously have a very strong wealth platform. We also have a very strong institutional platform. We're expecting a very strong year on the institutional side as well. We've got a number of products. And we saw 4Q, we saw a very strong institutional numbers come in 4Q. We were already off to a strong start in 1Q this year already in institutional. And when you think about the breadth of 2024 and what we have out there, we have multiple products in the credit business. We have our strategic equity product. We have diversified lending strategies, first lien fund strategies. We've obviously got GP Stakes Fund VI. We just did a very big initial close, but we have a long way to go here in 2024 and 2025, and we have some existing and new products in the real estate space that we think are going to be very interesting to institutional clients. Sure. So happy to take that. On your last point, we did an initial close with Lunate, so that we just got a press release out just in the last 24 or 36 hours. No, not at all. And so we've got some -- we've got our first close there done. And we have a road ahead to continue to raise that product. We think there's going to be a lot of excitement and interest over that product. It's going to take some time to raise the product just like GP Stakes Fund VI. For Fund VI, we don't expect it to be barbelled like what we saw with Fund V that was right in the middle of when we did our listing for Blue Owl. And so we think it will be more of a straight line there. Look, it's going to ebb and flow a little between institutional and wealth. And so you'll see one quarter, a little stronger institution, one quarter, a little stronger wealth. It may take some time for us to get on all the wealth platforms that we'd like to. Don't forget for Fund V, we were really on one large platform. It was a big private bank. Now we have the ability to bring all the Blue Owl all relationships to the table here and really get out on a lot more wealth platform. So we're very excited about that. And on the institutional side, if you recall, when we brought all these businesses together, we had single-digit percent overlap amongst our investor bases across our three businesses. Now we have the opportunity to cross-sell across all of those investors. And so we're very excited about that as well, Craig. Sure. Thanks, Bill. So on the transaction fees, we've talked in the past about that generally follows the trend of gross originations, they don't follow lockstep. So we could have a bigger quarter, one quarter and a little lower transaction fees in next quarter. 4Q was our second biggest ever growth origination quarter. So we had -- following that, we had a very strong transaction fee quarter. On the 60% margin, look, we will -- we talk a lot about not being complacent in the industry and we're going to continue to put very valuable dollars back into fundraising. And we're focused on both institutional and wealth in those regards. And we have a very built-out institutional and wealth fundraising teams. We want to continue to grow that. We want to continue to expand. We want to expand both in the US, we want to expand both around the world for institutional and for wealth. So we're going to continue to invest dollar in that. We're also launching new products. And so when you think about each scale product, I think I talked about in my remarks, every big scale product that we raise like a real estate Fund VI or GP Stakes Fund VI. We have other new products we're launching that have much lower margins. And so everything blends back to that 60% that we see for the next few years. Thank you, Bill. Sure. Thank you, Mark. Brendan, thank you for the question. Look, we continue to evaluate the strategic options that are available to our BDC shareholders. On the diversified lending side, we have BDC2, we have BPC3, which is now OBDE. We could continue to have that it on the New York Stock Exchange. It could also be natural to over time, merge something like OBD into OBDC. But we continue to look at that and continue to talk to our shareholders. On the tech side, on the software lending side, we have two private, private to public BDCs, OTF and OTF 2. And we continue to evaluate options for those shareholders as well. We have OTF, which is fully invested, fully deployed. It's fully levered OTF II, we still are deploying some of the capital. We have not drawn down all the capital from our shareholders there. But over the course of this next year, we'll make a lot of progress there. And we'll continue to evaluate whether it makes sense to merge those two and then list them or to list one and then continue to look at that. So Mark, what I'd love to do for folks, and hopefully, Brennan, you and your colleagues will find this helpful. When we think about, how do we paint the picture for you all of, how do you get to the $1 a share in your modeling. It's really straightforward, and it's not that many things that have to happen.

So we've talked about GP Stakes VI. That's a two-year -- we're targeting 2024 and 2025. As Marc commented, as I commented earlier, that's going to ebb and flow a little between closes, but that's a total of a 60% revenue growth. And so when you think about what do we need to do to hit the $1 a share, we need to keep fundraising on the wealth side.

But it's a few things that have to happen for us to achieve that dollar a share dividend. It's going to take a lot of hard work, just to be clear, but it's not a lot of things that have to happen. Great. Thank you, Brennan. And on the Fund VI closing, just to close that out, Brian. We did our closing towards the end of the quarter. So we'll start to see a positive management fee impact starting in 1Q. \nQ \u2013 Brian Bedell: Great. Okay. Awesome. Thank you. Thanks, Brian. Bring it home strong. \nQ \u2013 Ken Worthington: Yes. Real estate returns, you called out were negative in the quarter, triple net lease has held up really well versus other parts of the private real estate market this year and last year and the yield environment was sort of favorable in 4Q. So anything to kind of call out on the returns this quarter? Or what drove the negative. Thanks. Thanks, Ken. Thank you, everyone."

            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Ann. We finished 2023 on a strong note with another consecutive quarter of management fee and FRE growth, 11 for 11 since we've been a public company against a market backdrop that has been exceptionally volatile and uncertain. We're confident that our steady, strong, and resilient growth continues to differentiate Blue Owl and highlight the benefits of our business model. Over the past year, we've operated in an environment where the ongoing impact of higher interest rates and future rate uncertainty have constrained capital market activity and capital deployment. And exiting this year, the short-term path of interest rates, geopolitical risk levels, and economic growth trends remain heavily debating. By design, Blue Owl's growth has been distinctly more predictable, which is very thesis from the beginning. Our assets are generally permanent capital and our earnings don't include more volatile revenues such as carry and substantial capital markets fees. We strive to be market leaders in the segments in which we operate and our growth has been supported by structural demand for our strategies and secular tailwinds for those markets. We strive to generate strong growth in periods where market conditions are favorable, like in 2021. But importantly, to be able to offer strong and differentiated growth in much tougher environments like 2022 and 2023. I think we have certainly done that. We grew FRE and DE 25% this past year following over 40% growth in both metrics in 2022. In the last two years, AUM has increased by over 75% and the over $50 billion we've added in equity and fee eligible debt over that period, represents over 80% of our starting fee paying AUM. This robust growth has allowed us to return significant capital to our shareholders. And today, we announced our annual fixed dividend for 2024 of $0.72, or $0.18 per quarter. This dividend represents a 29% step-up from 2023, which follows a 22% dividend increase from 2022. Since our listing in May of 2021, total return for our shareholders has been over 60%. These are impressive results in any market environment, and much more so given the conditions that we've observed. Well, there are a multitude of successes across the business that I'd love to highlight. I'll call out just a few that I think represent the advances we are making at Blue Owl. In spite of the very difficult backdrop for real estate fundraising, our latest triple net lease fund was the single largest U.S. real estate fund raised in 2023. We expect to exceed our hard cap of $5 billion, more than doubling the size of the predecessor fund. Furthermore, our overall real estate platform performed admirably on both a relative and absolute basis, returning 9% for the year. In GP stakes, we saw robust investor demand and deployment pipeline, resulting in an initial close of over $2 billion for our sixth GP minority equity stakes fund, earlier than originally anticipated, and despite having just held our final close for Fund V at the end of 2022. In addition, we announced a joint venture with Luna in Abu Dhabi-based global alternative investment manager to provide growth capital to leading midsized private capital GPs. This will supplement our dominant position as a capital provider to large GPs, and we feel this partnership will create a powerful and differentiated proposition for mid-market managers. In private wealth, the resources we've invested into scaling the business continue to pay dividends with Blue Owl remaining a top fundraiser in both the non-traded BDC and rechannels. Gross flows from our perpetually offered products were $1.9 billion during the fourth quarter, 65% higher than the first quarter. Inflows have been six times greater than redemption requests, both in the quarter and for the last 12 months. And we think we are just getting started as far as what's possible in wealth over time. Finally, couple of weeks ago, Blue Owl Capital Corporation III, or OBDE, successfully listed on the New York Stock Exchange, delivering liquidity to those investors as promised. OBDE is the second of our BDCs to become a publicly traded company, and this listing follows the remarkable 2023 results of our first publicly traded BDC, OBDC, which returned 40% in 2023. Our focus remains on providing our direct lending investors flexibility and optionality through product structure, while retaining the excellent credit quality, attractive income, downside protection and scale benefits that Blue Owl is known for. Moving on to business performance. In credit, we again saw booming trends in deployment in the fourth quarter with a constructive environment so far in 2024. Repayments were somewhat elevated, providing additional opportunities to redeploy capital. As Alan will detail, direct lending metrics remain strong, with no notable changes to the health of our portfolio companies. We remain at 6 basis points of annualized realized loss since inception, which has been more than offset by realized gains and the underlying revenue and EBITDA growth of the portfolio are robust at low double digits on average. We are well positioned to benefit from incremental sponsor-driven activity and growing market share. In our GP Stakes business, we continue to witness the resilience of larger cap GPs, with the market share gains of these managers accelerating during more challenging fundraising environments. This phenomenon has been consistent across asset classes. And combined with LPs continuing to allocate more to alternatives broadly translates to the impressive growth we have seen in our partner managers. In addition, we are witnessing a rising pace of consolidation across alternatives, further substantiating the value of scale in this industry and creating incremental tailwinds for the investments in our funds. In real estate, we continue to actively deploy capital at attractive cap rates close to 8% and have consistently monetized at meaningful spreads to our entry points. The scale benefits of our triple net lease strategy allow us to offer attractive risk return for essentially investment-grade secured credit, and this has resonated well with our investors looking for steady income enhanced live appreciation potential. Our more recent real estate funds have invested heavily into the demand created by the on-shoring movement. With geopolitical tensions and supply chain issues continuing to dominate headlines, companies have elevated on-shoring to the top of their priority list. This $1 trillion opportunity represents, in our view, not a moment in time, but a transformational manufacturing renaissance in the US. The capital needs driven by this theme, combined with more constrained capital availability at large have created a very strong pipeline into which we continue to deploy capital. We're very pleased with the outcomes we've achieved across Blue Owl in 2023. Looking ahead, there are a number of growth avenues we are pursuing to supplement the expansion of our existing platforms. We intend to launch a strategy focused on triple net lease in Europe, driven by deal flow we already see today. Our strategic equity strategy held a first close and committed to its first investment during the fourth quarter, and we expect that we'll continue to expand our alternative credit strategy. And in addition to further expanding our institutional and wealth distribution, we continue to evaluate ways to partner with other large long-duration pools of capital, such as insurance. Generally, we intend to grow organically where we have institutional expertise and the conviction to grow into market leadership. And we will look to acquire, where we can benefit from immediate scale and strategic positioning. I speak to the entire team in saying, we are very excited about what lies ahead for the business, and there's a lot to look forward to. With that, let me please turn it to Alan to discuss our financial results. Sure. Well, without sounding snarky at all, I mean, look, to a degree of property, you get what you pay for. I mean, we are offering an exceptional result with exceptional performance. And we have, very importantly, when you look at the average fee rate, and you know this, we have always been focused on the quality of our AUM, the quality of what we take on. And so as we've talked about before, we really don't focus on gathering AUM because that is exactly how you drive your average fee rates down. You can depend whether that's good, bad or otherwise. But the reality is that we focus on where we can generate really high value-added returns for investors and therefore, high value, high fee income for Blue Owl. So at the end of the day, you can grow a lot of AUM at ever lower fees or you can say, look, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take lesser AUM, relatively speaking, and I'm going to deliver really high-value results on that and get paid for it. So I think we also look at the end of the day, our pioneering different strategies where we can add that value. And again, people are willing to pay for that appropriately so take tech, right? We were really very, very early with the idea of focusing on software lending. And I can remember Clear's Day and the number of people that said, well, why would you do that? And sitting here today, again, I don't say that with any arrogance or anything. But I think at the end of the day, today, I was like, well, of course, software loans are where you want to be. Well, we started that years ago and have pioneered that space. And so I think that's really the way we do it by having distinctive strategies, having really a direct angle on triple net lease when everybody else's real estate products are suffering this year we have a thriving real estate product is a differentiated strategy. So that's really the heart and soul of it. But at the end of the day, we got to keep delivering value for our investors, delivering great results. We know that and we plan to. Well, the healthcare product certainly is in line and -- or put it another way, let me contextualize the Cowen acquisition. Healthcare has been another very active sector for us. And we have done, I think, about $11 billion actually of loans and investments in healthcare including an ever expanded level of activity in royalties, which, again, you saw this year. And adding Cowen brings us yet another set of adjacent capabilities extremely deep on better the earlier part of that cycle and in particular, more of the pharma side, the science side. We have a series of PhDs that are part of that team that really understand the science on drug development, and that's additive to where we've been more in healthcare services and in things like structured solutions for, as I said, royalties and the like. And so now we have a full suite, full life cycle of capabilities. And by the way, as you've seen, the Cowen team has outstanding results, and they're really in a very, very interesting innovative area where they've dramatically outperformed their peers. So we now have all those pieces together. We see two big areas for growth. Healthcare is absolutely one of them. We've been starting to talk to investors. Again, we have to make sure we can come up with exactly the right structure, exactly the right product to your good first question. We have to do it in a way that's distinctive in a way that really adds value. We think we've got the pieces of that puzzle and now we've got to finish assembling that. So healthcare certainly has a meaningful analog to that tech story of six years ago. And then alternative credits, the other area, which I just Jason, while we're talking about it, this area outside of the traditional sponsor credit, we've really been developing a lot of capabilities in-house on things like ABL and airplane leasing, and that's another rich area that we're focused on. We think about credit opportunities for healthcare and alternative credit. Thank you. Well, Mark Zahr has done a spectacular job. So if I could -- thank you, Brian, and I'll join you in commending our partner there, really has architected a unique business model, which durability and attributes, of course, shine through this year. The business, as you know, with our new fund, we have now raised $5 billion, that's twice the size of the last fund, the largest fund, real estate fund in the US this entire year. And I will tell you that deployment is already off to a strong start. We already have hundreds of millions of dollars in LOIs and over 1 billion -- I'm sorry, in transactions and over $1 billion in LOIs -- so right at this moment, I would say we're probably pacing ahead of the ordinary pace of our product. And the demand is high because it's an alternative solution to capital needs for large corporate users and much like private credit, there's this element of adaptation, people finding the product and ultimately using it in more disruptive markets like people have experienced over the last year, you get more people thinking about innovative ways to finance. And so we have, right, at this point, our overall backlogs are really running at record highs in terms of all the things in our pipeline, over $10 billion. So we have plenty to focus on. And of course, also as we continue to extend that reach into Europe. So I don't want to say there's no constraint. I mean if you think about the massive amount of critical real estate owned by investment-grade institutions around the world. I mean that is a very, very large -- and it's mostly a white space. It's just not an area that's transacted. So I'm not suggesting that every company is going to do it with every asset or even close -- but if you kind of take a step back and contextualize what amounts to, of course, the biggest fund in this market are versus that marketplace. We're a fragment. So I don't think addressable market is in any manner a constraint. But we've got to keep going out there and finding the best product and developing the partnerships and proving that, that's a really innovative and effective way for these companies to finance. But clearly, people like Amazon have made that choice, and there's plenty of others that we have worked with that are likewise doing it. And last point, I guess I'd add is this new onshoring move, onshoring trend, which, of course, everyone is well aware of is going to be a potentially huge driver for this asset class. The amount of money that's being spent just right now on developing semiconductor production in the US. These are gigantic fab plants, for example. And the capital intensity, I think I was just reading that Sam Altman wants to raise some number of trillions of dollars to develop chip capacity, every one of those things is a giant new facility. And in a world of -- not going to be so easy to find trillions of dollars of capital, you certainly don't have to own the real estate. So we've been very active in dialogues with chip companies, for example, and what a great asset for us, a core institutional asset that's going to run for a very long time, big dollars with many, many wonderful credit counterparties. So I -- we appreciate every day we have to work hard to find the best investments, but addressable market is sizable, pipeline is very active right now. And then as I mentioned, a Europe as a whole another rich vein that we're continuing and working on how to mine best, because the companies we work with are global and they have real estate in Europe and they ask us about their real estate in Europe. So that's another leg of growth from our point of view. Thank you very much. Thanks, Alex. And in the insightful phrasing of your question is on aspirations, I just want to start with, which is fourth quarter did indeed reflect, I think something important about the continuing evolution of the business, both in having the several adjacent legs and having several adjacent strategies, staying very much in our northbound highway. So to be clear, we have a strategy that is not all things all people back to the beginning of this conversation. But we do have more arrows in that quiver. And so what we saw, well, set in the fourth quarter was all of that starting to kind of show up in 1Q. Now I'm very cautious about focus in each quarter. We don't manage our business quarter-to-quarter. Fundraising, as you obviously know, is very episodic quarter-to-quarter just based on mandates and flagships and exact timing of product launches. So try to manage that way or sort of guess that way, but what you did see in the fourth quarter, which I think we will see repeat itself more is this breadth between products. We have significant fundraising in credit. We have significant fundraising in real estate, and we have significant fundraising in GP Stakes, and we will continue to -- we expect to see that in 2024. Again, we now have more multiple product points of access at multiple products. And then between wealth and institutional, likewise, we've got both very much developing plenty of room to run. There's our -- real estate continues to offer a product, which is the only net inflow real estate product in the marketplace, is still only on a very few number of platforms, and we're just have and are launching on many new platforms this year to offer that product. So I think that composition is exactly kind of the building block into 2024. Again, there's always going to be the ebbs and flows of when a new flagship comes in or when we launch on a new platform, but I think we do feel like we're in a good place heading into 2024 in the balance between products and between channels. And wealth continues to be strong for us and institutional continues to be strong. We've seen some of those SMAs. We've long talked about start to actually convert and credit, and those are big chunky numbers as well. Sure, and appreciate both questions. So, first, with regard to insurance, look, it's an area that we have been for years, spending time on trying to develop a appropriate strategy. So let's start with this. We have two terrific channels of capital access that we talked about today, wealth and institutional, traditional institutional. The one we don't have that, obviously, some of our peers have done so well with is insurance. We're aware of that. We've been working on that pretty thoughtfully. We may not be able to develop the right solution, but it's something we're focused on adding to bring that third key leg in that again, most others have developed. From our point of view, we're going to stay true to our strategy. Look, we are in the asset management business. We are balance sheet light. Both of those will remain our focus. We do not aspire to own an insurance company, we aspire to become an insurance company, people have different strategies, so we're not opining on anybody else's strategy have been enormously successful for other people. That's not our strategy. So, our strategy is much more about how do we access asset management the insurance channel in a balance sheet light way. So that's really where our focus is. And it will continue to be an intense focus, maybe an ever more intense focus, as we head into 2024. And as we've now really gotten our other acquisitions integrated, and you can see kind of the cylinders firing in the fourth quarter. With regard to -- sorry, what was your second question? Oh, yes, the Luna JV. Yes. So just to be clear on the architecture, this is part of our GP solutions product and back to this point about having adjacencies that are highly strategic and additive where we can add value for our investors in a distinct way. So today, as you know, we really are the market for large cap GP solutions. And in fact, that fund very much by design, focuses on large cap managers, the CBCs, the Veritas, the Silver Lakes. And so that's been an area where we've built a distinct network. We have our BSP, our operational support resources. And we love that space. And of course, we're in with our flagship where we got off to a good start in the fourth quarter. There's another arena that has not been our focus, which are these more higher -- well, it may not be higher growth actually because those firms we grow quite substantially. But younger firms or smaller firms that have a lot of ongoing potential or the so-called middle market. So hence, our advantage fund in combination with Lunate is our way of coming with a value-added solution to that market. In all our markets, again, I'll anchor back to what do we want to get paid for. We're going to get paid for delivering outstanding risk-adjusted results, you have to have a value proposition for that. Well, we are now coming to the middle market, so to speak, the growing marketplace there, and we're delivering two things with this partnership that are very distinctive. We're delivering our capabilities as, by far, the largest investor in GPs and the entire network that brings with it. And the operational resources, which are -- certainly been valuable to many of our large cap GPs, but think about the value and impact of those resources to a firm that can't afford to hold all those themselves, right? If you manage $50 billion, $100 billion you can have a whole lot of operational capabilities in-house. But when we manage $5 billion and growing our ability to bring our BSP at all that capability around how to kind of best practice and support growth, that's real value. That's something people should consider beyond price. And Lunate is a very big investor and intends to continue to be a big investor to the best of our understanding in private equity. So we also bring along someone who's going to have a very, very strong and obviously, positive view of anybody we partner with. So they'll make their own decision that goes with that, but we bring along this deep capital partner pool. So I think that brings us into a position to add real value in this middle market space, and we don't control that below $10 billion of AUM. So it's complementary. It's not -- it's really just filling out the pie, the puzzle, the going all the way across the spectrum. Thanks, Alex. Good morning. Thanks. Great. It's been a channel we've been after since day one. We're coming up on a decade, eight years, I guess, and we started trying to build into that channel. And it's obviously great to be able to see the benefits of that investment. We have a lot of people focused on this. We've spent a lot of time building trusted partnerships. So listen, we did have a very good fourth quarter, and that momentum continues. The wealth channel interest in these products. In no small part, I'll keep coming back to it. At the end of the day, it's about delivering performance. And if you look since inception and our OTIC product, it's delivered just about a 12% return. You look at our OCIC product, just about a 10% return. And our ORENT product delivering -- I mean, mammoth outperformance and stability with a 7% distribution rate that has tax advantages for many investors. So I always come back to that because that's the value-add part people hopefully are drawn to. So we continue to see great interest and growth in our core income and tech income products. That's on a lot of platforms. Now, I don't have all the numbers of platforms in front of me, so I can't answer that numerically, that's on a lot of platforms. There continue to be places that we work to penetrate. But I will say this, we've looked recently with one of our partner platforms. And you look, the penetration is still very low. The actual share of FAs who utilize the product is low. And frankly, the number of what so-called power users, the people that really use meaningful amounts of it. I mean that's really low. And so I think that speaks not just to Ball, that's the broader wealth channel. But I have looked at our stats, there's a lot to do inside of the existing platforms it say, our core income, our credit products, which are also the ones that are probably best understood today and most in favor for their attributes. The old [ph] rent piece, as you note, we had, again, certainly very nice growth which reflected just the continued organic interest and the addition, I think we may have had a platform or so last year. But now we are adding and already have added a couple of new platforms and we expect several more during the course of this year. And that is a kind of therefore, a dual opportunity as the -- as people learn more about the product, and there is a certain virtuous circle in this area as you get adaptation of the product, adoption of the product. And then here, we have new platforms that we're launching on as well. So, we view -- real estate has been our fastest-growing business, as you know, this last year in in assets. And we continue to look at real estate as the potential to be our fastest-growing business because of the distinctive model we have and the adjacencies, we're still working into both channels of distribution, things like geography, I mentioned. Europe, when we think ahead, we think about we're deep in credit. We're deep in real estate. We've talked about this before, real estate credit, it would be literally filling in something we have enormous strength in. So, I think we're quite enthused about real estate and the opportunity, especially given the disruption. Last thing I'll say you said this very, very wisely. There is a -- for a good reason, a very negative sentiment about real estate. So, we have to kind of sell through the up. You said those two words and then get down to number, wait, yes, it's a disruptive category, but here is the way you succeed in it. And that's actually showing in this manner, we're getting great cap rate purchases today, right? There's a bit of the baby at water where people are saying, real estate, but that's rated by our measure, a triple net lease warehouse to an investment-grade client if we get the uplift of just negative sentiment therefore, higher cap rates, we'll take it. Yes. I should have mentioned, they're making also a large anchor commitment to the product when I was kind of listing the attributes here gets us right out of the gates, but sorry. But look, it's still as all alternative products, but certainly this one. It definitely has a bit of a front-end load and a back-end load. So -- we don't want to -- it will not be $2 billion the quarter. It's nowhere near that linear. Everyone on this -- everyone listening here knows the natural lumpiness of different timings of close. So, we did have a particular attribute in Fund V with the acquisition at that time and then the IPO. So we don't have that. But I think you should still anticipate more get first close done. It's -- there's some period of time before we then do another close and then some period of time before you get to another close. So it will not be linear, but it will -- it should be quite as hold out in the middle. Sure. It's certainly been and continues to be a very good environment for direct lending. So said a lot of people are talking about it, Kyle. I'm not chuckling, but it's a little bit on how much attention all under wants to talk about private credit, whether that is, in fact, a large part of their strategies or not. But we're happy about it. We're happy to -- we're perfectly satisfied have a day in the sun. We also get that everything gets and stay in the sun. So look, we've been at this for a long time and are going to be at it for a very long time, delivering for our users, a capital solution in scale and in tailored fashion and doing that in a way that is reliable to them, and we don't compete with them in private equity. So I think we do have a distinct architecture here. And with all that said, look, it's a good environment today. I think to call it what it is, the economy is sound. We can all have different views and of course, about where we'll be in 6 months and 12 months. I will tell you that, if you look at the performance of our portfolio, this -- the lag with the last full quarter, we have able to report from all our portfolio companies. Our revenue and EBITDA growth were higher than the prior quarter. In point of fact, the EBITDA growth on average across the platform was 15%. So now we obviously focus on some very, very attractive industries, attractive businesses with the biggest backers, I don't measure suggesting that's indicative of the economy or broadly all portfolios, but it does tell me we've got a very healthy portfolio. And certainly, not an unhealthy economy, and I think actually would be a good reason to think we have a pretty solid economy at this point from the micro -- we're not macro experts from the micro up here in the US. So that's good. We continue to have strong demand. And from what I understand, and again, you all have better insights into this. But if you talk to the M&A community, they're seeing a lot of activity picking up here as we go into the first quarter. Those are natural cyclicality to all things that are M&A related, which is to say fourth quarter is obviously always a big quarter because people are finishing things and then first quarter, be able to restart these new processes. So setting aside the natural timing. I think we feel like the sentiment is very strong. So the outlook to us feels very good in terms of likely activity this year. There's $2.5 trillion of private equity dry powder. And they obviously had a very tepid activity year last year. So I think we imagine that in a world that looks like this, expect there'll be a lot more activity. And more activity would be the one thing I would have liked to have in direct lending, it would be just more aggregate market activity. We love the credits. We love what we're getting done. We love our position and market share. But aggregate activity is still ultimately a boundary condition. So hopefully, and it seems reasonable to expect 2024 should be a more active year and we'll gladly take that. So finally, to come on to your question about spreads competition. So it's true, of course, that more dollars have been raised in private credit, but no more in proportion than historically to private equity. And in fact, private equity obviously has been accumulating assets here that now have to get deployed. And so I think we feel like the market remains generally in balance and looking out, again, anticipating more activity we can't meet the needs of all the capital markets. We need the liquid markets to return to have a fully functioning capital market environment. And so while 2022, of course, it's a wonderful time for credits and spreads, and there was no meaningful public market, hopefully, what we'll have is more activity and a functioning public market. But overall, that big iron take spreads have come down from their peaks, we certainly saw them come back in from particularly wide levels. And that's okay. Remember, we operated in exactly that environment just a couple of years ago. We're still getting paid really well by our measure, look, our -- since inception, we've done over $80 billion in loans, and our running loss rate has been 6 basis points. And in fact, that's been more than offset by realized gains. So for that kind of underlying credit performance, our ability to deliver double-digit returns. I mean, of course, we'll take a wider spread if we can have it, but we have a very attractive risk return proposition as we originate today. And in the large end of the market, parting comment is, a lot of the activity in the articles and of course, are new entrants, to your point, it's like the trendy topic. But that's a different part of the market we're in. We're in this pyramid that Doug has talked about before. At the top of the pyramid, we're doing the largest companies with the largest sponsors, which we like for credit reasons, not some other reason really headlines and the like, it's better credits in our view. That remains the domain of a handful of people, many of whom have raised a lot of money. So the dollars -- if you look at the dollar flows, a lot of the dollars are in the hands of the same handful of people that had them before. So the top of the pyramid isn't really changing meaningfully. The bottom of the pyramid, there's definitely been a lot of new people jocking down there. It's not where we operate. Well, look, we certainly see a meaningful opportunity. These things take time to develop well and right and to be able to develop the value add. And so look, tech has been extraordinary, and I -- we're lucky and we appreciate that we were able to create that opportunity. I wish that was somehow the future of health care and maybe someday, it will. I don't think that's the template we would have in mind. I think this is about methodically building across the platform. It's already an area we're very active and to be clear. As I said, we've already done $11 billion of investments in this arena. So I think it's too early to really give you a lot of direction on scale and timing, but it is safe to say it's an area we're very focused on developing our platform. Tech, I think, was a pretty special case. It is true we have a much more developed infrastructure and much more developed platform and a much more developed set of LPs. But software is such a mega trend, and we were so early with that. I think that was pretty special. But this is definitely an exciting opportunity. I'm talking about another huge part of the economy in health care is certainly it. And we now have a complete set from life sciences to structured solutions to health care services capabilities. So we're going to work on it, and we'll certainly keep you all posted as we develop. And by the way, I love the -- nothing blue about 72 in your flash note. Thank you for that. Good morning. So whether it's less susceptible to bank, I mean, at the end of the day, the flow lines have been away from the traditional syndicated market toward us, not the other way back, of course, as you know, it's certainly true. You're not going to take small companies and do syndicated loans. But that's kind of part of the problem with the nature of those credits and the scalability. We always get offered brought these smaller transactions. And listen, nothing -- not a one size fits all, but I can tell you on average, the credits are nowhere near as good and the terms are no better. So I genuinely don't understand the argument for the smaller cap alone strategy. It's a perfectly fine strategy. But somehow, I don't know if you want to try to position us, oh, here's an advantage over large cap. There isn't an advantage. That doesn't mean it's not a perfectly good business. With regard to banks and the flows, so you make a really good point. There's two forces at work, and they'll show up in different ways at different times, which is the return of some functioning liquid market, and I think we are seeing the return of some function in liquid market. Again, with the kind of the Asterix on I'll say, we're happy about that. I mean we need that to have a good functioning and vibrant marketplace. The abstracts, is of course, it's nice when the market is entirely in the private hands. But that's not a bad dynamic in aggregate. And then, there's going to be this by directional point when those liquid markets return, of course, that means that's going to be an option for users when it wasn't an option. But remember, that was a wide open option in 2021, when we were thriving and having some of our biggest origination periods, which kind of speaks to the point that activity meets our value proposition, ends-up often being the net positive even when there's, other people bumping around or even very active in the market. And what's happened over the last several years. And we've talked about this, I think, on a lot of the calls, once people try using the private solution, many, not all, decide that's absolutely what they want to do going forward. The value proposition of the 3Ps, Predictability, Privacy, Partnership, is something that has been now tested by many people. And they said, of course, it's true. And by the way, just I don't mean this to be, again, overly conclusive. I don't have anything like the knowledge every private equity investor asked, but I did do private equity for 20 years. And I can say this there is no private equity transaction that will work or not work from a return point of view because you paid a little bit more and we do charge more for the loan. And you had a stricter document. Look, if you're performing well, it won't matter if you have a stricter document. You get in trouble, it will matter. And that's of course, how we protect ourselves. And so at the end of the day, a lot of people, I think, are realizing the ease of execution having the predictability of Terms, having a truly Private Capital Structure, so I'm not dealing with quarterly reporting now to bondholders, instead of stockholders. And most importantly, that phone call, when times change for better or worse, that partnership preferably for better. And we've had a lot of that, people calling up and saying, \"Hey, can I add on what an opportunity in 2022. No one else can buy right now. I want to buy. Can you provide me capital?\" And our answer is, absolutely. So I think that will continue to thrive as an option. And then last, as you mentioned, there will be less, some things will go to the syndicated market. We are not suggesting otherwise, but something that in the syndicated market are going to come down, our market. As you have noted with your question and we've already seen that, right? We've done that with Finastra. We've done that with PetVet things that are coming out of that market, I would suggest there's probably a lot more opportunity for them to flow in that direction than people who have had a great experience in the Private Market saying, \"Oh, I'm really excited to be back to the market of having 100 different lenders when I can otherwise deal with one or two. So we take everybody seriously, and there's, great value propositions. The banks do a great job. I think we do a great job and a healthy ecosystem as both of us doing our job. Don't have the percentage in front of me. So I can't quite answer that, but I can say they're doing very well. That is to say that the Software area continues to be extremely healthy. We continue to be in a place where we have not yet had a loss on a software loan. In fact, we've not had a default on a software loan. And that continues to be true. So the recurring revenue loans are -- or those businesses continue to do very well. And when I think about the portfolio I would stand by what we concluded six years ago, software on average is -- are the best credit to the market, which is why we went there in the first place and why we go there now. So, the recurring revenue loans are doing very well. Remember, one other thing on recurring revenue loans, because again, for reasons I understand, it gets a lot of attention in the sort of, hey, that's not what people traditionally pictured. But recurring revenue loan in the context of a big SaaS company is a company that has a lot of revenue, a tremendous amount of gross profit, right, 80%, 90% margins. But is spending a lot of that to further grow their business and therefore, further grow those gross margin dollars at rates way above the average enterprise in the US, or elsewhere. As a lender to that company, you don't get to spend 50% of your revenues on marketing and sales, if you don't pay your interest bill. So I think one of the durability elements that has shown, and we bought to be true, and I think still though sometimes in this distinction, not to say it's lost, but I think it's undervalued. If I have $400 million of revenue and a 90% gross margin, I have $360 million to spend. And I may want to spend it all on growing my business. But I don't get to spend any of it until I pay for that 30%. And it's only on average by 30% and a fraction percent of my capital structure that Blue Owl has financed. So I feel very good about the stability of those positions, and we've experienced that when there have been questions raised. Those are some of the earliest people to say, no problem. We got you. Like let's just talk this through. And we love our company, and we want to keep growing. So how about we put up some more money? How about we come up with something that works for everybody. Of course, one of your questions are certainly not too long. I think, we can all conclude there's any danger to my answers are too long. But we like to be transparent. So with that said, with regard to the listing, the listing has been extremely well received, and here's why. We told people when we create these private vehicles that we will, in an orderly basis in an appropriate amount of time, create the option, but not the obligation to -- for liquidity. People that had an illiquid position earning a wonderful return, now have a liquid position, earning a wonderful return. And so that one has to sell anything. And in fact, it remained, I don't say a mystery to us, but we certainly would prefer to many investors that are considering direct lending, why wouldn't you buy BDCs in the public market at a discount to their NAV? Now, there's a reason for that. Some people don't want that level of volatility. So back to the point, create the ecosystem, create different access points, different people have different preferences for how they want to invest. But it's a heck of a fine proposition. So, if you don't sell them these variances in trading really aren't going to matter, and you're going to get your dividends. But if you want to sell because you have other priorities, adjusted for wherever that price may be, then great. Now you have that option that doesn't exist in a traditional fund. So I think, it's been very well received because we -- for us, it's important to us to deliver on our commitments to our investors and our commitment was to deliver that option at the right time. So with regard to the possibilities going forward, mergers, maybe Alan, I'll turn it to you for that. Listen, we remain on track to deliver in or around dollar. And certainly, we've taken another really nice step, right? We've raised the dividend 29% to $0.72 and fundamentals in the business are strong. So every time we step closer, obviously, that feels good in trying to get there and deliver. And obviously, you can give us all collectively more comfort. There's still enough variables here in 2025 that we in and around, we pick on purpose. The dollar remains our target. We feel good about being in that range. I think the really important point I want to come back to here is that because of the predictability of our model, the stability and the growth we've now this year, grown kind of all our key metrics, 25%. And that's more than kind of double the average of our many of our peers when we look at results, which are all good results, an incredible organization. So we've done that in a highly predictable way. Remember also where we are right now is exactly where we all talked about a year ago. And that is true. I think what maybe is most distinct about our performance this year is not just the pure strength of it, which, I mean obviously, we're very pleased with, but also the consistency and predictability despite all the changes in the market. We don't have carry in our numbers. We did -- a lot of people have some really strong fourth quarters, but that was after people didn't expect things to be good in the fourth -- people didn't think there'd be much carry. So numbers came down. So I think that predictability gives us the following comfort. And every time you get closer, probably qualitatively a tighter band, the band around that dollar should be narrow. So our aim remains the dollar. We continue to see the pathway forward. But in any case, that band gets narrower and it should be within a narrow band given just the nature of our business. Yes, happy to. So Today, we do some opportunities in Europe, but we have a U.S.-centric product, obviously, in a U.S.-centric focus. But the companies we work with are global. And so they have regularly come off and said, hey, listen, this really great solution we have with you in the U.S., how about Europe? And periodically, we do one. But what we need now is a dedicated pool of capital to expand what we have available to be able to meet that need, and we'll do that through a structure that's appropriate for Europe. And so we're really following our customers, really following the demand and that demand is substantial. Is there a difference? Well, the similarities is they're very high-quality companies and in many cases, the same global enterprises, not obviously, in every case. So it expands our lens in terms of where we can work with our current customers. It expands the customers we can work with. The opportunity, therefore, for us is organic because we already are the leader in that market and have the distinctive skills. So this is an organic build an opportunity. Are there any real differences? The only thing when I talk to the team today, on average, the terms, that is to say the lease terms, the opportunities are probably a little better in Europe right now. So I'd say cap rates meet quality of credit, probably a little more attractive. But I don't know if that's statistically significant. At the end of the day, it's really doing what we do so well here and taking it to this marketplace and putting a structure that is optimized for doing so in Europe. Absolutely. And thank you. The consolidation activity in alts is -- it's clearly noticeable, right? It's happening in a pretty material fashion, and it seems like there's continuing to be a lot of activity out there in terms of pending conversations, explorations people are having. And so a few implications of that. And your question hits right on probably the most substantial one, which is look, it's clearly a tailwind for our GP strategic capital business. And I say that, I guess, in two ways. Most importantly, I was coming back to how do we deliver great results for our investors, we own a vast number of stakes in GPs, some of whom will end up selling themselves to other consolidated tours or other big pods. We've already seen that, right? We've seen like a [indiscernible] get purchased, and that was a great result for us. Perhaps there'll be some more IPOs, that tends to be a good path for us over time. So that consolidation is a lift in the potential valuation and realization of value in all our prior GP funds. So again start there, that's good for our investors. It also presents new opportunities. Because on the other hand, you're also going to have people where there's one firm choosing to buy another and need capital to do it, right? So that's another great motivation for working with our GP strategic capital business is to provide the capital you might need to be one of the consolidators. And so that creates more demand. We're active on the GP stake side. We have a lot of active conversations. We're largely through the commitments, as you know, of investing Fund V. In fact, we even did a little bridge co-investment vehicle that we mentioned here before, just to kind of bring us from Fund V to now Fund VI, where we've done this close. So it should be an active area. It is clearly a favorable dynamic to have more consolidation activity, both for portfolio and for deal activity. So it's a positive, exactly how much of a positive we'll see as the year plays out, but it's a helpful trend. So look, this has been a really wonderful durable strategy by design. I mean that is our reason to be. That's our value add and in high-risk on market, people it's hard to get that signal through the noise. And obviously, in this environment, the signal comes through loud and this is a brand that performs in all markets, and we've seen that here. As for the loss -- this very small loss this quarter. That was actually a portfolio has done really, really well. The slight negative for what it's worth to a mark-to-market on the debt in our real estate business. But I -- not to haggle which direction the aggregate result for the year is a pretty good template for where we are and where we've been. There was nothing peculiar about fourth quarter other than some peculiarities in this mark-to-market part, but nothing about performance. Performance remains extremely strong.\nQ \u2013 Ken Worthington: Excellent. Thank you. Thank you all for your time. We really do appreciate the patience here this morning and spending the time with us. And we look forward to continuing to drive hard. We have a lot of work ahead, but we are excited about the starting point for this year and the opportunities and conditions to keep driving forward in our mission and goal to try to get to that $1 a share in 2025. Have a good day."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Blue Owl Q3 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now hand the call over to Ann Dai, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nAnn Dai: Thanks, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Doug Ostrover and Marc Lipschultz, Co-Chief Executive Officers; and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company\u2019s control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time-to-time in Blue Owl Capital\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We\u2019d also like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website at blueowl.com. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blue Owl Fund. This morning we issued our financial results for the third quarter of 2023, reporting fee-related earnings or FRE of $0.17 per share and distributable earnings or DE of $0.16 per share. We declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the third quarter payable on November 30th to holders of record as of November 20th. During the call today, we\u2019ll be referring to the earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning, so please have that on-hand to follow along. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Doug.\nDoug Ostrover: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. It\u2019s been a pleasure to spend the last two years on these earnings calls with our shareholders and analysts. As we move through the transition of the Co-CEO structure that we announced earlier this year, we decided to take a divide and conquer approach to allow each member of the management team to leverage their time more efficiently. And so going-forward, you\u2019ll be hearing from Marc and Alan on our quarterly earnings calls, while, Michael and I will be taking a step back from this aspect of the business. To be clear, I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019ll continue to be very available and accessible and I look-forward to seeing many of you at upcoming conferences and meetings. That said, given the rapid growth that we\u2019ve had at Blue Owl and what now feels like a pretty well-oiled earnings process. It feels like the right time for me to focus my attention more fully on the many strategic growth initiatives we have in the works right now. So with that, let me hand things over to Marc.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thanks so much, Doug. Today, we again demonstrated the steady and resilient growth that we believe sets Blue Owl apart in the alternative asset management space with our 10th straight quarter as a public company, also being our 10th straight quarter of generating FRE growth. When we think about what\u2019s happened in the world over that timeframe. This time in 2021 10-year treasuries were around 1.5% and a year ago, they just crossed 4%, with the expectation by the end of 2023, we\u2019ll be talking about rate cuts. Obviously, those expectations have shifted meaningfully over the past year. In the first three quarters of 2022, S&P 500 corrected 25% as interest rates marched upwards, only to reverse and rally 20% over the next year, despite elevated rates and ongoing geopolitical risks. The capital markets and M&A have been installed for the better part of the year, and in March, we witnessed a handful of bank failures that took the market completely off-guard. All of this is to say, the only thing that\u2019s been clear over the past couple of years is the lack of clarity into the short-term path of rates for the longer term impact of those rates on economic growth and how liquid markets will react to the information we have on-hand. In contrast, we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate our Blue Owl permanent capital at FRE centric model by design, creates a differentiated and more predictable earnings profile. And on a last 12-month basis, we have grown DE by 28% and FRE by 26% despite of these market headwinds, since we\u2019ve been public management fee growth has been over 40% per year. That\u2019s not to say that this growth has come easily, but one advantage we have structural is that very few assets leave our system, because our AUM is mostly permanent capital. So the capital we\u2019re raising is generally additive instead of replacing assets that are being returned to investors. On top of that, our business is positively levered to many of the ongoing secular tailwinds within alternatives, including the continued growth of direct lending, larger managers benefiting from ongoing consolidation across alts and private wealth\u2019s incremental adoption of alternatives as a core component of an investor portfolio. For these reasons, we feel confident that Blue Owl will remain a differentiated story with a differentiated growth trajectory. As it relates to the fundraising landscape, we continue to see very positive indications for demand across our strategies, which are generally income-oriented and downside protection-focused. Across our perpetually offered products and wealth, we raised $1.5 billion in the third quarter, a nearly 20% step up from the prior quarter. Over the last 12 months, we have been the top fundraiser in the industry in both credit and real estate when looking at net flows, and on a gross basis, we have been the second-best fundraiser over that period. Both of these are extraordinary statistics and I think testaments to the many years that we\u2019ve been building our platform and relationships in this space. Now, a lot of firms are trying to catch up to where we are and given the size of the opportunity, this is not a zero-sum game. We and others can do well at the same time and there will be a lot of growth ahead across the industry. But I wanted to take a moment to recognize what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish so far. I think we are exceeding expectations in the face of headwinds and I\u2019m very enthused about what lies ahead for this business. On the institutional side of our business, we announced $1 billion mandate from a leading sovereign wealth firm, reflecting continued progress in the strategic and geographic expansion of our LP base. We have improving visibility into the end-of-year flows as we launch fundraising for a handful of strategies, including GP Stakes, for which we anticipate a small close for our sixth fund before the end of this year. We are very excited about the potential for cross-sell for this fund with our credit and real estate investors and we\u2019ve seen strong demand to bring the GP Stakes strategy to a number of new wealth platforms as well. In real estate, we remain very well positioned, despite the substantial headwinds in this space. Having already reached our $4 billion target for this latest vintage of our flagship fund, getting to the $5 billion hard cap, which we expect to hit, will represent a doubling in the size from the prior vintage, a challenging feat even in strong markets and reflective of the distinctive and attractive attributes of our net lease strategy. And as I mentioned earlier, in the wealth channel, we are outselling competitors by a wide margin and we continue to build out that syndicate. And we remain engaged in a number of institutional investor dialogues regarding separate accounts and upcoming launches, some of which may close during the fourth quarter. Moving on to the business performance. In credit, we saw improving trends in deployment, with Blue Owl taking lead roles in some of the largest deals and refinancing announced or closed across the market, including Finastra and PetVet. Repayments during the quarter were elevated relative to levels seen earlier in the year, providing additional opportunities to redeploy capital at even more attractive levels. Overall, we continue to see our direct lending business expand as we meet the capital needs of an evolving marketplace. And the risk-reward opportunity presented by private credit today remains one of the best we\u2019ve seen in our tenures as investment professionals, a sentiment that we often hear echoed back by our investors. In our GP Stakes business, we continue to witness the resilience of larger cap GPs, with these managers being the beneficiaries of market share gains during more challenging fundraising environments. In real estate, we\u2019ve been active in deploying capital at attractive cap rates, with Fund VI about 20% committed or deployed and have continued to monetize at meaningful spreads to our entry points. Bringing all of this together, we think of our business as Alternative Asset Manager 3.0, meaning our business offers the steady stream of management fee-driven earnings that investors have been asking for in conjunction with the robust growth that they expect and we have a greater ability to keep assets in our system due to our permanent capital. Our financial profile is very simple and durable, and doesn\u2019t depend on realizations or capital market fees to drive earnings growth. As a premier solutions provider to a large and growing market, we think we offer a very attractive proposition of strong earnings and dividend growth underpinned by a core asset base that is exceptionally stable and we look forward to continuing to prove this model out to all types of market conditions. With that, let me turn to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. To start off, we are pleased with our third quarter and LTM results. Marc mentioned this, but I want to reiterate that this is our 10th consecutive quarter. It\u2019s actually been every quarter since becoming a public company of both management fee and FRE sequential growth. The only alternative asset manager that has demonstrated this over the past two and a half years. And as Marc also referred to earlier, as you can see on slide five, our management fees have grown at a 42% CAGR since we became a public company. We\u2019re talking not just very good growth, but steady, consistent, resilient growth through what has obviously been a very challenging and volatile market environment. So let\u2019s go through some of the key highlights of our LTM results through September 30th. Management fees are up 32% for the LTM period versus a year ago, and 93% of these management fees are from permanent capital vehicles. FRE is up 26% for the LTM period versus a year ago and our FRE margin is right on top of our 60% target, which we continue to expect to be the target for the next few years. And DE is up 28% for the LTM period versus a year ago. Now I\u2019d like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts. As you can see on slide 12, we raised $2.9 billion in the third quarter and over the last 12 months, we raised $14.5 billion. I\u2019ll break down the third quarter numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised over $2.1 billion. $1.2 billion was raised in our diversified and first-lien lending strategies, including over $900 million raised in our wealth distributed credit income BDC, OCIC, returning to a pace we haven\u2019t seen since the first half of 2022. And approximately $1 billion was raised in our tech lending strategies, including approximately $300 million raised in our wealth distributed tech lending BDC, OTIC. In GP strategic capital, we raised approximately $100 million during the third quarter and in October, we closed on approximately $400 million for a GP Stakes co-investment vehicle with a longstanding and valued partner, which will invest side by side with our fifth and sixth GP stakes funds. In real estate, we raised approximately $700 million, approximately half of that in our sixth vintage of our real estate strategy and the other half in our wealth distributed non-traded REITs, ORENT. We have now raised over $2 billion of equity in ORENT since its launch a year ago, primarily through just one wire house and during what has been an exceptionally challenging environment for real estate. So we\u2019re pleased with those results. And since May, we have launched ORENT on a few additional platforms and have some meaningful launches ahead for the fourth quarter and into 2024. As Marc alluded to earlier, we continue to see strong institutional interest in our products and we are expecting a strong finish to the year in the institutional channel. As we have discussed throughout the year overall, as we head into the end of 2023, we continue to see fundraising tilting institutional for the year. In the wealth channel, we have continued to see solid interest in our strategies with steady increases again in our fundraising levels quarter-over-quarter and we believe that will continue to build on itself through the end of this year and into next year. We are very excited about where we can be next year. All in all, we\u2019ve raised over $36 billion of fee-paying AUM since January 1, 2022. When I think about fundraising overall, we\u2019ve always talked about how permanent capital differentiates us, because assets not leaving the system means that we have higher growth for the same amount of fundraising. Said another way, we keep more of the capital we raise than our peers. Putting some numbers around that, for approximately every $5 of fee-paying AUM inflows we bring in, we see just $1 going out in the form of distributions or redemptions. For our peers, on average, every $2 raised is met with $1 leaving their system, meaning half of their fundraising covers assets that are being paid out to investors in one form or another. That\u2019s a huge difference. It\u2019s a big advantage for us. In addition to the staying power of existing AUM and the benefit of ongoing fundraising, we have substantial embedded earnings that we will unlock over time. AUM not yet paying fees was $12.6 billion at September 30th. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees, totaling over $175 million once deployed. And as many of you will recall, we have over $200 million of management fees in aggregate that will turn on upon the listing of our private BDCs over time. We believe, in part because of these things and in part because of our permanent capital, we have a higher quality of earnings. Moving on to our credit platform, we had gross originations of $4.4 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $2.1 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $13 billion with $7.4 billion of net funded deployment. So as it relates to the $9.3 billion of AUM not yet paying fees and credit, it would take us a little over one year to fully deploy this capital based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. With that said, as Marc commented earlier, we have been seeing a considerable uptick in pipeline activity in our direct lending platform and believe the fourth quarter could be a much bigger quarter for deployment than previous quarters this year. Although the impact of management fees in 2023 will be nominal, it\u2019s a great place to start 2024. Our credit portfolio returned 4.1% in the third quarter and 17.4% over the LTM, while annualized realized losses remain approximately 6 basis points on a gross basis and have been fully offset by realized gains. Rated average LTVs remain in the low 40s across direct lending and in the low 30s specifically in our tech lending portfolio.  For our GP strategic capital platform, total invested commitments for our fifth GP Stakes fund, including agreements in principle, are approximately $11 billion of capital with line of sight into about $2 billion of opportunities, which if all signs would bring us through the remaining capital available in Fund V. And performance across these funds remain strong with a net IRR of 23% for Fund III, 46% for Fund IV and 21% for Fund V, all of which compare favorably to the median returns for private equity funds of the same vintages. And in our real estate platform, deployment activity remains robust with over $1 billion deployed during the quarter. And our pipeline of opportunities remained strong with over $4 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract to close. With regards to performance, we achieved gross returns across our real estate portfolio of 2.4% for the third quarter and 13.8% for the last 12 months. Okay, let\u2019s wrap up here with one closing thought, dividend growth. This year, we will have posted dividend growth of 22% over last year and since becoming a public company, we have achieved a 28% CAGR for our dividend, the highest in the public alternative asset manager space and we feel this is truly reflective of how we have grown our business. Dividend growth is our north star. It reflects our pace of growth, but also informs about the quality of the earnings underlying that growth and the confidence we have in the staying power of those earnings. It\u2019s a metric that captures all aspects of our business, including fundraising, deployment, revenue growth, embedded future earnings and so on. And for that reason, it\u2019s one of the metrics that we think investors should be most focused on for us. Thank you again to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that, Operator, can we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Doug, Alan. Hope everyone\u2019s doing well. Following Alan\u2019s comments around a strong finish to 2023 in the institutional channel, we wanted to get your perspective on the quarterly inflow of $1 billion and how we should think about the level of institutional fundraising over the next few quarters, actually especially with a first close in GP Stakes VI by December 31, especially?\nMarc Lipschultz: Hey, Craig. This is Marc. Thank you for the question. Look, this quarter is -- quarter four is expected to be a strong one from a fundraising point of view across wealth and institutional. We\u2019re seeing terrific strength in wealth continue to grow there. As you know, we\u2019ve been the number one net fundraiser in the market and we continue to see substantial growth as we head into this month and this quarter. And then institutional as well with GP Stakes VI, we do expect to do our first close in the fourth quarter. And so I guess it leads probably to a broader point, which is to call it what it is, look, we expect fourth quarter to be very strong. This quarter, the timing between when things close for us is a little less predictable. We just don\u2019t run as many funds. So we don\u2019t like to get either overexcited about a particularly strong quarter or overly concerned about a quarter that\u2019s a little bit lighter. We look forward to long-term strong predictable dividend growth. We just don\u2019t run as many funds, as you know and we don\u2019t expect we will. Today, we have the highest fee rate in the industry. We run products where we are going to deliver superior risk returns and where we can build true scale, as you know, in really just about everything we do. We\u2019re a market leader, if not the singular market leader and that\u2019s going to continue to be our center of gravity. What we want to do is grow FRE and grow dividends, and of course, did that again this quarter, and we plan to do it again next quarter and keep on keeping on in that regard. So between wealth institutional and having a flagship product back in the market in Q4, we do anticipate it being strong.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks, Marc.\nMarc Lipschultz: Of course. Thank you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Just for my follow-up, we were looking for an update on Oak Trust\u2019s fundraising trajectory. So I was wondering if you could share how many large retail platforms it\u2019s on today. And if you have line of sight into more platform additions over the near-term. And any other comments around its net flow potential would be helpful, too? Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thanks, Craig. We are currently live on three platforms, three large platforms. We added one currently in the fourth quarter and we anticipate coming on one or more additional large platforms in one queue. The trajectory continues to look strong, again, in the face of incredible headwinds in the world of real estate, and certainly, relatively speaking, very, very strong flows that we\u2019ve seen to-date. If you recall, we\u2019ve raised about $2 billion primarily from really one wire house platform in the face of a number of things that have happened over this past year, and in the face of strong headwinds, as I said, in real estate writ large. So we continue to be cautiously very optimistic about continued trends up and to the right in what we can do with our ORENT product, in particular, in 2024 and forward.\nMarc Lipschultz: I\u2019ll just add something to that and I -- linking kind of the two comments, my comment and Alan\u2019s comment, together. ORENT\u2019s a great example of a truly distinctive product in the real estate space and one where we see really substantial long-term potential and growth. It is a far more durable product. We continue to generate extremely attractive positive returns in ORENT during markets where people are maybe a little less discerning about risks, those distinctions don\u2019t appear significant. Then you get into a world of uncertainty and products that are really built for durability, which is the hallmark of what we do at Blue Owl, really sing. And that is in no small part why ORENT is by far the number one net fundraiser in the market and we are continuing to grow at a time when the word real estate is out of favor and that\u2019s exactly what makes the opportunity for ORENT and for us so substantial because we\u2019re delivering excellent returns in that market and frankly originating at really attractive cap rates with outstanding counterparties. So that is an area where I think you\u2019ll continue to see us. When we look forward, we think it\u2019s one of the most exciting areas we have. We see it on the institutional side, frankly, as well. We have already closed $4 billion for Fund VI, which was our target. We\u2019ll hit our hard cap of $5 billion and that\u2019ll be double the size of our last fund. And I\u2019ll mark it again where everyone else in real estate is going the other way. That\u2019s that kind of durability, predictability and product differentiation that\u2019s going to continue to be our hallmark and I do think ORENT in particular will be an extraordinarily attractive growth engine for us. It produces a great yield with great predictability and stability.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Marc, Alan, thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Craig.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlex Blostein: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Actually, a question for Doug, maybe going back to the first point you made in the beginning of the call around some of the changes in sort of leadership priorities and how you guys are going to be spending your time. So maybe help us frame kind of what your strategic growth initiatives are that you expect to focus on over the near-term and really which one of these are you expecting to be most sort of needle moving in terms of revenue growth into 2024?\nDoug Ostrover: Sure. I\u2019m so happy I get a question. I was sitting here dying to speak. First of all, let me just say I\u2019m not going anywhere and for better or worse, you\u2019re going to be stuck with me for a long time. I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve built and I think we\u2019re in the early innings of taking this business to a whole other level. And we\u2019ve always wanted to create and I think we\u2019re executing on becoming one of the most unique alternative asset managers. And just for everybody listening, I really plan on just spending as much time as possible with our stakeholders, our LPs and shareholders. Look, we have a number of initiatives and I\u2019m happy to offline to go into a lot of them. But let me just give you one that I think will resonate. About six and a half years ago, we saw a really interesting opportunity in the software space. It was a growing sector. There were no dedicated pools of capital there. We launched our first dedicated software lending product and today we have about $20 billion of capital focused on that sector. If you look what we\u2019ve done in healthcare today, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time working with buyout firms. We\u2019ve done, I think, almost $14 billion of deals in the space and have a great track record. We\u2019ve added expertise in Royalty Pharma. We\u2019ve now -- we just made a small acquisition to add life sciences expertise and we\u2019re spending a lot of time thinking about could a dedicated healthcare product be comparable or the TAM is certainly bigger than the software space. So that\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019re working on and where I plan to spend the bulk of my time.\nAlex Blostein: All right. Awesome. And we definitely look forward to still speaking with you. So my second question may be less strategic and a little bit more micro. So, Alan, I think this one\u2019s for you. I think in your prepared remarks, you suggested that FRE margins will hover around 60% for the next several years. I guess I\u2019m just better trying to understand, why isn\u2019t there more operating leverage in the business that\u2019s growing revenues at a pace that you guys have been able to put up and are likely to continue to put up over the next few years.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thanks, Alex. So we\u2019ve talked about FRE margins. We think operating at a 60% FRE margin is a very strong margin. It\u2019s obviously among the best or the best in the industry. And as we continue to grow, Doug just talked about, some new product launches. As we continue to grow our business, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in that business, whether it\u2019s people, whether it\u2019s real estate, whether it\u2019s placement costs, whether it\u2019s comp. And so I would expect a high growth rate for our expense line, no different than for our revenue line. Obviously, ideally, our revenue line outpaces the expenses. But as we continue to reinvest in the business, I continue to think a 60% FRE margin is the right place for our business to operate for the next few years.\nDoug Ostrover: Yeah. I -- Alex, look, there is would be natural scale economies, to your point. But we continue to be very focused, not just measured in quarters or even a couple years, but many, many years on continuing to deliver really strong FRE and dividend growth and so we do want to continue to put some capital and some of our available revenue into starting new products. We\u2019ve done a lot very successfully organically and we continue to want to do that. We want to continue to invest in building the infrastructure, world-class infrastructure, in our organization to be the best in the areas we\u2019re in. So, I think at already the highest margin in the industry, it\u2019s not particularly a priority to see how to make that higher relative to making sure we continue to grow revenue at an extremely attractive rate and therefore convert that into FRE and into dividends.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: When you think about what we\u2019re investing in, Alex, we think about healthcare, as Doug just mentioned, in terms of organic product launches. We think about our strategic equity product that we\u2019re in the process of launching. These are all organic that we\u2019re building from scratch internally here or that we have been building from scratch. Think about continued investment in our institutional fundraising platform, continuing investment in our wealth fundraising platform. These are all things that are critical to that revenue growth that we continue to talk about. And you pull the lens back and you think about how simple our business is. We\u2019ve taken an FRE revenue growth number times 60%. FRE margin, that\u2019s our FRE growth and that translates to very high continued dividend growth year-after-year.\nAlex Blostein: Yeah. All right. Thank you all very much.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey. Good morning, everyone. My first one is on deployment. Craig Packer was super bullish on deployment on your most recent update call and indeed the gross net originations were up 30% sequentially, but both FPAUM inflow and transaction fees were down sequentially. So could you help us better frame how to model the ins and outs of the movements of those line items against activity levels, which were obviously much better?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Why don\u2019t I\u2026\nMarc Lipschultz: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what, let\u2019s do this. Let me start on kind of what we\u2019re seeing in total in the marketplace originations, you\u2019re obviously driven from that and then Alan will connect in with some to kind of a specific question of how do you model it, so to speak. So your observation, of course, is absolutely spot on. The originations were up and measured in percentage terms up quite substantially at 30%. That\u2019s not -- that\u2019s pretty meaningful in the context of our business. That said, we\u2019re still at levels obviously below originations where they were a year ago, when times were much, much more active in the M&A market. So a couple of observations that remain true today. First and foremost, the direct lending role in the financing markets remains extremely substantial. And I don\u2019t know if you like to use the word market share. I\u2019m not a big fan of the word market share because it suggests that, we and the banks are competing for the same financings. We\u2019re really not. We\u2019re offering a completely different value proposition and we\u2019re a holder, not an intermediary of debt. But in any case, just to use that word for a moment as a shorthand, the share for direct lending is extremely high and Blue Owl\u2019s role remains leading. We continue to be absolutely a key driving force in many of the very biggest financings for the very best companies and biggest sponsors. So all of that is very positive and in part reflected in the 30% growth. On the other hand, it is a statement of the obvious that M&A remains low in total and we can only have -- we can have as full a share as we all collectively want and Lester\u2019s M&A activity, it can only translate into so many dollars. And sitting here today, we continue to see good activity levels in terms of inflows. Certainly seems to be more convergence between buyers and sellers in converging on prices. Quality of assets is excellent. The things we are seeing, the things we are originating, the quality is outstanding. Now that may reflect our own origination and our own very, very selective financing choices. We\u2019ve looked at 8,400 loans to make the 500 or so we have. But I think it also reflects the reality of the marketplace today, which is higher quality companies are what can be sold and higher quality companies are ones that can be financed, certainly by us. We focus on very high quality companies. And so I think in total, what we\u2019re seeing is a very, very strong position in a kind of tepid M&A market. It will return. One might have thought, a few weeks ago it would return even sooner sitting here now with the geopolitical world we\u2019re in. I don\u2019t know. You all have as good a perch as any. But we have had a -- continue to have a very nice pipeline of certainly very high quality product. And with that in terms of how to think about the flows the ins and outs. Maybe we turn it to Alan a little bit on that one.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Great. Thank you, Marc. So, Patrick, when we think about -- there\u2019s a number of different factors that all drive through what you\u2019re referring to, what your question is. When we have fundraise, obviously fundraise raises are AUM and fee-paying AUM. Generally speaking, we\u2019ll have some fee-free capital that we\u2019ll raise from time-to-time, like what we closed a little bit of in 3Q that goes to AUM but obviously doesn\u2019t accrue to fee-paying AUM. We\u2019ll have AUM going up for fair value increases that also doesn\u2019t accrue to fee-paying AUM. Gross deployment will. Sometimes we\u2019ll have paydowns during the quarter on loans that we originate that are paid back. That doesn\u2019t leave the system. That just needs to sit until it gets redeployed. And so you have different things moving different of those ratios up and down. And then you also have debt. So for us, there\u2019s a number of our products where we earn a management fee on debt, on total assets, so equity plus leverage. And when we raise debt in those products, that goes to fee-paying AUM. So they won\u2019t always move in sync, but generally speaking, you should see all of them increase over time.\nPatrick Davitt: Okay. Thanks. And any update on thoughts about expanding into more kind of closed-end fund wrappers like some of the other large direct lending players do?\nMarc Lipschultz: Other -- when you -- other closed-end fund wrappers meaning?\nPatrick Davitt: Meaning like a more institutional kind of drawdown type fund structure.\nMarc Lipschultz: Oh! Got you. Look, we have -- yes, we have a strategy of being, as you know, the market leader in large cap, high quality financing solutions. We have a model that\u2019s distinctive, which is anything we originate gets shared between the handful of funds that we manage. We have a much, much simpler business, both to understand, to manage, for infrastructure, as you know, than our peers and fewer different vehicles, as noted. However, in answer to your question, yes, we continue to look at ways to meet the market where they want us. That is to say, to meet structures that serve different constituents\u2019 needs. So, yes, we have continued to expand the types of offerings we have, to your point about other types of closed-end funds that may look like more traditional funds. Absolutely. We\u2019re pursuing putting those in place as well. We\u2019re all about creating the on-ramps that meet the needs of our investors so that that\u2019s designed for them and then delivering to all of them a common, high quality experience by being able to share in every loan that we make that\u2019s appropriate to a strategy. So that itself, as you know, is pretty distinctive. So we will continue to add those on-ramps into our product suites. Yes.\nDoug Ostrover: I think I would just add here, Patrick, generally speaking, we have a wrapper for each type of distribution channel for each of our strategies. A lot of those wrappers will take both institutional and wealth clients and investors, but we do have GP LP structures that meet the needs for each of our strategies. Some of them are just not as scaled as, let\u2019s say, our BDC platform and so they don\u2019t drive the numbers as much, so you don\u2019t hear about them as much on these earnings calls. But we do have products that suit those needs.\nMarc Lipschultz: I realize this isn\u2019t the question that you asked exactly, but I just want to add one other thought. Look, it is not our intention, though, to proliferate products so that we can just gather assets. We\u2019ve said this before, we are keenly interested in growing FRE and dividends. We are not keenly interested in growing AUM for the sake of growing AUM. There\u2019s a lot of very low-margin AUM that\u2019s available, right? And so gathering assets, launching vehicles, we\u2019re just not going to pursue having dozens and dozens of vehicles just so we can get a dollar. What we want to do is get very high-quality dollars. Our fee rate is the highest in the industry and that reflects the quality of what we deliver to investors and the kinds of assets we raise and that, I think, will continue to be very important to us. We\u2019re not in the AUM gathering business. We\u2019re in the outstanding results and market leadership business.\nPatrick Davitt: Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thanks, Steven.\nDoug Ostrover: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: So I wanted to start off with a question just on your European expansion plans. There\u2019s been some press articles suggesting you\u2019re exploring a deal for a direct lender in Europe. I don\u2019t expect you to comment on that specific deal. Maybe just speak to your broader preference to build versus buy to expand your footprint in the region and whether recent speculation that peers are looking to launch no-carry credit funds in Europe informs your appetite to grow.\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thank you. So as noted and appreciated, obviously, we won\u2019t comment on any particular speculation in terms of M&A. But to say this, look, we as a firm, I would put in order three kind of priorities when we think about how we grow our business. Well, above all of it, of course, is delivering outstanding risk-adjusted returns at all moments, right? Our LP experience is monumentally important ultimately to us. It actually doesn\u2019t impact our financials, as you know, because we are a fee-based business. So our business is distinctively predictable. We don\u2019t have performance fees. But to us, delivering outstanding results will always be, lifeblood from our point of view. Now, with that said, there\u2019s three ways for us to grow the business, all three of which we have done and will continue to look at. But in this order, it is organic growth of our base product business, base products. Again, we have market-leading positions, decidedly the market-leading position in triple net lease for high quality -- high credit-quality counterparties, decidedly the market-leading position in GP strategic capital. And one of, don\u2019t want to overstate it, one of the market-leading positions in direct lending. And continuing to lead those markets is going to be our focus, continuing to have scaled products, which lead to very strong margins and strong fee rates because we have a great value proposition for those investors, is going to continue to be where we will focus first and foremost. And remember, because our capital is permanent, 93% of our revenues are based on permanent capital. So that growth, every time we bring in a dollar, we\u2019re keeping those dollars, we\u2019re a layer cake, not the spinning wheel, and as you heard us say, we\u2019ll take in, for every dollar, for every $1 that leaves our system by virtue of say a quote realization or a return, we have $5 coming in. Our average competitor has $2. That is a huge difference in growth impact in that organic phase. So that\u2019s going to be priority one. Priority two is add in products where we can ultimately become the market leader, a market leader, but most importantly, deliver a really strong experience. Take our Blue Owl strategic equity product. GP-led secondaries. Huge market opportunity. That\u2019s a place where we\u2019ll do our first close in Q4. We have a really distinctive solution. We think that could be a very large addressable market and we have a capability to originate, underwrite and make investment decisions that is truly distinctive and we think will allow us to deliver outstanding results. So part two, build new organic products. Doug just talked about healthcare. We can do in healthcare what we\u2019ve done in software and technology. We have the capabilities. We\u2019ve built out, you saw our acquisition of the common health business, finishes rounding out extremely deep intellectual capital and relationships to do that. Three and it is acquisitions. When we can find a business as fantastic as Oak Street, we\u2019re going to want to buy it and add it because it\u2019s incredibly accretive and additive in every sense. Marc Zahr is a brilliant investor and senior leader for this firm, and so that\u2019s an addition along with, obviously, terrific growth. It\u2019s been our highest growth business. So when we can find that cultural fit, strategic fit, we\u2019re going to do it. So I appreciate that was all a lot, but I do want to really talk about how we build our business going forward. As for, therefore, say, European direct lending. Well, look, strategically, it\u2019s a perfectly coherent place for us to be, right? We are a market leader in U.S. direct lending. Now, we like the U.S. market a lot. The risk return is very compelling in the U.S. market. Being in European direct lending makes perfect sense. Is it necessary? No, it\u2019s not necessary. If we can find the right platform, whether that would be organic or inorganic, I\u2019d say in Europe it\u2019s more logically inorganic, acquired, given the scale and complexity of the marketplace. But it could be either over time. We\u2019ll look at both. And getting at that market is something that would be very logical and certainly something we\u2019re serious about. But we don\u2019t have to do it. We\u2019re only going to do it if we can do it really, really well and when we do it, we\u2019re going to deliver great results doing so and we\u2019re going to be disciplined about it. So that\u2019s kind of the framework when we think about European direct lending. Good business for us to be in on the right basis. It doesn\u2019t make our U.S. business better. It doesn\u2019t make Blue Owl better unless we can be a market leader and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. With that said, and last question you raised about people and the kind of fee structure in Europe. Look, our fees are the highest fee rate in the industry for a reason, because we deliver great returns, and people are willing to and should be willing to pay for that. It\u2019s a net result that will matter for our investors. I can\u2019t comment on anybody else\u2019s specific strategy, but look, when you\u2019re trying to get into a market like direct lending where we\u2019re a leader, sometimes people can try to attack on price. I don\u2019t -- It\u2019s not part of the way we see the world. It\u2019s not part of the way we operate. But look, in every market where someone wants to get in or is trying to catch up, sometimes they\u2019ll may try price as a lever.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for the fulsome response there and maybe just for my follow-up on credit performance. The credit backdrop has been benign for the last decade plus. We\u2019re starting to see some evidence of defaults rising with higher for longer rates. Not a surprising development, but one variable that we\u2019ve been paying closer attention to is recovery rates. That\u2019s been steadily declining for two decades plus, mind you. I know you spoke about LTVs in the low 40s provide significant loss cushion. I just want to get your thoughts on where recovery rates could settle out this cycle, especially given your heavier exposure to growthier sectors such as software and healthcare.\nMarc Lipschultz: Well, let\u2019s start with, I would say, how many years has it been that people have said, oh, the credit problems are coming, the credit problems are coming, we just don\u2019t know in direct lending, these sort of very amorphous and I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re saying this, but these kind of amorphous, spooky-sounding questions, which I think, we can guess sometimes who the people are that advocate that story. Let\u2019s just start with a few facts. The fact of the matter is we haven\u2019t seen any uptick in defaults, any uptick in losses. In point of fact, we\u2019re still running at a 6-basis-point annualized loss rate since inception, all of which has been offset by realized gains and a bit more than that. Now, I appreciate and agree it\u2019s been a generally benign environment economically, but, I mean, we did have a pandemic. We have had a war in Ukraine. We have had rates rise dramatically and we\u2019ve had many peers experience a lot more credit problems than we have. I\u2019m not saying that with complacency or arrogance or anything like it, but at the end of the day, there are differences in the way we operate, the credits we pick, how we pick them. You noted the most important part from our point of view, which is loan-to-value. Having lots of cushions, both in percentage and absolute terms. Remember, when we\u2019re lucky enough to partner with Thoma Bravo and lead a financing for, say, Anaplan, not only is it a 70% equity check, it\u2019s a $7 billion equity check. Both of those matter in this calculus, percentage and scale, and that\u2019s why we focus where we do. So, with regard to default rates, let me just observe that the signs that will presage, that will come ahead of a meaningful change in default rates, those are not in any manner flashing yellow yet. That\u2019s not to suggest that there won\u2019t be a recession at some point. In fact, as credit people, it\u2019d be crazy for us not to contemplate and plan for that. But today, our portfolio, right now, revenue and EBITDA on average across the portfolio grew 10% quarter-over-quarter. That is pretty robust. Now, that\u2019s partly the favorable selection of the kinds of businesses we underwrite, but pretty favorable. We aren\u2019t seeing any meaningful change in requests for out-of-the-ordinary course amendments. We aren\u2019t seeing any meaningful change in requests for PIC. We aren\u2019t seeing meaningful changes in running out of liquidity. So, I say all of that to say that we don\u2019t see any of those, not just warning signs, they sort of are checkpoints that have to happen before you get to meaningful defaults. Then you get to recoveries, to your point, which we couldn\u2019t agree more, in some regards is the critical item, because a default in and of itself isn\u2019t a problem. Now, we\u2019re better off to avoid them and we can count the number of defaults we\u2019ve had literally on things like fingers. So, keeping defaults really low remains the most important thing we can do and will do. But when we\u2019ve taken companies, our recoveries have been extremely strong and keeping loan to value is the way to ensure that. When you\u2019re running 40% of a purchase price in a loan, a fire sale still gets you your money back and that is really important. That\u2019s why we like these big, durable, strategic assets. We\u2019ve said this from inception and there\u2019s been lots of questions along the way as we led the market toward this direction of lender of first choice going to the biggest credits, the best credits, why, lots of talk about all those, there\u2019s more opportunities in the small market, there\u2019s not. The opportunities to be in the big credits where you have that durability because they\u2019re strategic assets that someone will buy, even if they stumble, even if they get in trouble. And that, to your point, which we couldn\u2019t agree more, is all about maximizing recoveries. The last part you said was in these growthier businesses, software businesses. Actually, the reason we like those businesses is because the recoveries will actually be the highest in our view. Those businesses, if and when they have a problem, they still have enormous amounts of gross margin, right? These companies, the ones we finance and the ones that are bought have extremely high, let\u2019s set aside even the growth rate, assume that somehow has to get tempered if we\u2019re going to have one of these problems that you\u2019re talking about. But these are still businesses that have hundreds of millions of dollars of customers that are really for all intents and purposes dependent on the use of a piece of software with 80% to 90% gross margins. Taking that and consolidating it with another strategic owner of a software business is exactly the kind of way out that we\u2019re talking about. Someone wants that business. That is a valuable cash flow stream, unlike a traditional industrial business where let\u2019s suppose you\u2019re out in a deep cycle and nobody wants the capacity. Who wants a factory that doesn\u2019t have any use for its capacity? That\u2019s just not what you have in these software businesses. So, it\u2019s exactly why we like it. It\u2019s why, in point of fact, we have still not ever had a default in a software business, let alone a problem with a recovery.\nSteven Chubak: Those are great insights. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian McKenna from JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, you\u2019ve been clear about your expectations for growth in 2023 and then you also have the dollar dividend target out there for 2025. So, first, are you still comfortable with the dollar dividend target at this point? And then how should we think about the underlying trajectory of growth in 2024? This year, FRA growth will total in the low-to-mid 20s. So, is that a good starting point for next year?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll take the last part of that question. When you do go out to the dollar-shared dividend based on our Investor Day, you could certainly see both revenue growth and FRA growth for the next two years in the approaching 30% or 30%-plus range. I\u2019ll leave it to Marc to touch on the dollar-shared dividend and how we feel about that goal.\nMarc Lipschultz: Look, the dollar-shared dividend remains our north star. That -- we\u2019ve just talked about this numerous times. We are about durability, predictability, FRA growth and dividend growth and the dollar remains our target. There\u2019s no doubt, it\u2019d be silly not to observe we\u2019re in a more volatile world. We have been during the course of this year and now in the last few weeks, it\u2019s going to be kind of a wild eye not to say we\u2019re in an ever more volatile world given what\u2019s happening geopolitically. So, does that create incremental risk to that dollar? Sure, it creates some incremental risk, some incremental variability. But remember, because we\u2019re a permanent capital business and because we have very predictable fee rates and because we have all this capital that\u2019s already in the system that\u2019s being deployed, our model is extremely durable. So, the band around, say, the dollar is a tight band. We don\u2019t have performance fees and things that are going to drive meaningful variation. So, is there a little more risk to it? Sure, there\u2019s a little more risk to it. But that risk is very banded and it continues to be our north star is driving our way to that dollar.\nBrian McKenna: Helpful. Thanks. And then, Alan, I believe you noted that Real Estate Fund VI is 20% funded or committed. Clearly, the deployment environment is very constructive right now and you noted a healthy pipeline of potential deals. So how should we think about the quarterly pace of deployment for this fund, kind of moving into next year? And then, can you remind us at what level of funded or committed do you typically start raising for the VI Asset Fund?\nMarc Lipschultz: So, on the real estate front, we\u2019re very active. This is a good time for the triple net lease real estate business for a couple of reasons. One is, look, in a world with much less functional capital markets, the use of a real estate asset as part of a financing plan is more interesting to every kind of user. Remember, our partners in that business are people like Amazon and Walgreens and Starbucks. I mean, it\u2019s not as if these are people that have financial challenges, but using real estate versus where the world was a couple of years ago where issuing nearly free IG borrowings, that\u2019s changed, right? So, it creates more interest in these types of novel solutions. We are originating today at incredibly compelling cap rates, close to 8% kinds of cap rates for IG counterparties. So, we love what we\u2019re getting. The pipeline is very, very active as a result. We\u2019ve already now deployed about 20% of Fund VI. And as I said, we\u2019re doing great on fundraising for Fund VI, perhaps no surprise, given that we\u2019ve been able to continue to generate really outstanding returns in an asset class that many people have found they struggle with now. So, in terms of the exact pace of deployment, again, like anything, it will vary quarter to quarter, but I would call our pipeline in real estate extremely strong. So, we expect that to continue to be a pretty robust deployment arena for us.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: And we\u2019ll typically look to the industry level of 75% to start thinking about the next follow-on fund.\nBrian McKenna: Great. Thank you, guys.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You guys had an acquisition here this quarter, a small one with Par-Four. Could you let us know what the impact was for revenue from that deal, what we should expect in the fourth quarter? And then, more broadly, this is not the first COO manager you\u2019ve bought. Should we continue to expect you to roll up some more of these COO managers and build out the business and the scale in that business for yourselves?\nMarc Lipschultz: So, with regard to Par-Four and then the more general question, I would -- per the framework I described, look, we will always look at acquisitions where they are additive or strategic, if you want to use that term. And Par-Four is a really great example of this build versus buy, organic. And I also think maybe it\u2019s sometimes -- not lost, but I think it\u2019s worth calling back out in the context of things like growth and fundraising versus AUM. The -- at the end of the day, we can launch CLOs and we can, like every other firm, use a bit of capital to do that or maybe even some cases firms a lot of capital to do that and that would lead to raising $1.6 billion and that would show up in our fundraising column. But instead, we\u2019d say, look, we can, for what turned out to be really de minimis consideration, acquire these contracts, and instead of building them, in that case, buy them, and that actually is another $1.6 billion of fee-paying AUM, the jointer system. Now, again, I don\u2019t want to get over focused on AUM, but I do want to point out that in our system, we\u2019re constantly going to look at what is the best way to get those assets, the most effective way to do it, that is accretive for the continued growth and dividends of our business. So, Par-Four is a great example of substituting, I would say, an acquisition for very little investment in place of an organic build of the very same CLOs that we could have undertaken. So, that\u2019s there. Will we continue to add to that? Sure, opportunistically, we\u2019re happy to add to it. CLOs are a much lower margin business. Our specialty, without question, is in the world of private capital solutions, so you should not expect us to become a large liquid manager. That\u2019s a very different, lower margin business. Our products are much more distinctive in the world of privates. We stay focused on what we\u2019re really, really good at. But, yes, it\u2019s an area we can continue to add to. It\u2019s not an imperative for us to become particularly large in CLOs.\nBrennan Hawken: Thanks. And the impact of revenue for the quarter, what we should expect for 4Q?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Brennan, we haven\u2019t disclosed that.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Then one last one, more of a sort of housekeeping item. Now that members of senior management are going to be paid in all stock, should we expect that adjustment, the equity-based comp adjustment to sort of ramp a little bit here -- from here? What kind of impact should we expect there?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. So all of our senior members of the management team, Doug, Marc, Michael, Marc Zahr, others, have been taking stock comp entirely for the last two-plus years, almost since we\u2019ve been a public company. So that continues its tremendous alignment with our shareholders and you shouldn\u2019t expect a meaningful increase due to that.\nBrennan Hawken: Excellent. Thanks for taking my questions.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Brennan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlex Bernstein: Hi. This is Alex on for Ken. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Two questions, please. The first one, can you double-click on the real estate segment again? You posted positive returns, which is definitely a nice difference versus what we\u2019ve seen in some other parts of the market. Can you please speak about what\u2019s sort of driving that and maybe some of the differentiation that you\u2019re seeing relative to other players? And then the second question is, I notice that just about the Cowen HealthCare acquisition, if you could talk about that one as well, that would be great? Thanks so much.\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Yes. I\u2019m happy to comment on both. Let me start with the Cowen HealthCare question. So Cowen HealthCare, another great example of being able, by virtue of our platform to grow both capability and add to our earnings simultaneously. As Doug commented, healthcare has been a very, very significant focus for us. We\u2019ve deployed significant capital in healthcare lending, royalties, structured solutions and now, by virtue of adding the Cowen business, are adding in even greater depth on the pharma side. And in the pharma side of the business, of course, there\u2019s technical skills involved. There are knowledge that the Cowen HealthCare team has in spades. They\u2019ve made investments in 60 different companies over time, pharma-centric companies. So by adding that capability, we now have added to a full spectrum of abilities within healthcare that will allow us to really take that business forward in life sciences over the next 20 years. In our humble view, it\u2019s going to be an area of enormous opportunity, much like info services was the last 20 years. Probably not a coincidence that we\u2019ve been able to build the market-leading position in software lending and looking ahead to see an opportunity in healthcare with some similarities. So that is kind of on a chase for strategic reasons. But done the way we have, by adding Blue Owl and making Blue Owl a platform that people want to join, we have a team that said, look, this is where we want to bring our platform. The consideration was very, very minor for that business, because it was really about the team coming and finding a home. So what we have managed to do in that case is add to our capabilities terrific people and add $1 billion of assets and add earnings as a result. So it wasn\u2019t an or. We didn\u2019t have to go pay some huge price in order to get admission. Quite the opposite. We have a great team join us, get a team and assets and earnings. So that was really what\u2019s behind the Cowen business. Very excited about Kevin and his team. With regard to real estate. So on the real estate side, we\u2019ve been able to continue to post attractive returns, because we have a very, very distinctive proposition. We don\u2019t do in real estate what other people do. We don\u2019t own things that have to be released. We don\u2019t own things that have vacancies. We don\u2019t own things where this inflationary environment and the expenses flow through to us. We have a vacancy. Now you also have the expenses. We have triple net leases, the expenses, the inflation that has obviously been occurring in the world. That\u2019s the responsibility of our tenant. Our tenants sign up with us for 20 years at a time. If you look at, for example, in Q3, just to give you a sense of the power of this model, because again, we offer a value proposition to our investors. We partner with the Walgreens of the world. We\u2019re not just out in the market buying from brokers, like, I\u2019ve heard before, I can recall being in a setting where one of the leaders, one of the biggest brokers in the country said, we never sell anything to Blue Owl, because they originate at rates way higher, way more attractive than we sell at and you can see that in our practice. So if you look during Q3, for example, we purchased 71 different properties for over $1 billion at an average cap rate of 7.9% with a 16-year average lease. I don\u2019t mean to just spew numbers, but just think about that for a minute. Roughly 8% cap rate, 16 per year average lease, triple net. So we are not taking risks. In fact, we\u2019ve made basically the equivalent of loans to mostly IG companies and we own real estate as a backup in the case that we needed it. At the same time, during the same period, we sold 16 properties for over $0.25 billion, $267 million to be precise, at an average cap rate of 5.4%. So we\u2019re buying at 8%, we\u2019re selling to 5.4%, generating on average a 31% net IRR and a nearly 2-time net equity multiple. So why do I say that? What I\u2019m saying is our business and the role we play as a strategic partner to large corporates allows them to conduct what amounts to wholesale transactions, to get dollars that matter to them. Selling a store doesn\u2019t do any good. Selling a warehouse has limited impact. Having a true partnership with someone that has billions of dollars to offer them, that has value. So we can buy it wholesale. And then at times, we will go ahead and sell those properties and we consistently have at prices meaningfully better than the prices we acquire at. So you\u2019ll hear even in a very disrupted market, rising rates, real estate is disrupted. I mean, not that it\u2019s hard to describe a worse environment for real estate, but this is a pretty choppy one. We were buying it at 8 and selling at 5.4%.\nAlex Bernstein: Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes to the line from Mike Brown from KBW. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Brown: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question. On the fundraising front, it looks like all three business segments could see a better year in 2024 versus the challenge 2023. Can you just maybe help me summarize the building blocks for next year? So in GP Solutions, you\u2019ll have the Outlook Fund VI. In direct lending, you\u2019ll have both from BDCs, SMAs, and perhaps, CLOs. And then in the real estate side, Fund VI should be done, so I guess most of the contributions would actually be from ORENT. Is that correct? Am I summarizing those pieces correctly? And I guess if you just summed it all up, what would be kind of the most important fundraising campaigns?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Yes. You summed it up correctly, Mike. BDCs, SMAs on the credit side, CLOs, GP Stakes Fund VI and ORENT. And you\u2019re right, Fund VI will be largely wrapped up by then. There are new product launches that we talked about earlier that Doug and Marc hit on, whether it\u2019s healthcare. We have an interesting new real estate product or products coming out to the market in 2024 that we think we could raise some good dollars on. And some other strategies we haven\u2019t talked about to-date that we think could be interesting in 2024.\nMike Brown: Okay. Great. So I guess more to come on those. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the dollar dividend commentary. You\u2019ve really delivered exceptional growth on the dividend thus far and your payout has consistently been in that kind of mid to high 80% range relative to GE. Is that payout still the right way to think about that dollar dividend as well in 2025 or is there kind of like an evolution in the business or a change in the balance sheet that would allow you to maybe increase that payout closer to 100% or even if you were to do so somewhat temporarily? Thanks.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Yeah. I don\u2019t think -- it\u2019s a great question, Mike. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an evolution in the business. I have commented on previous calls that that number can move up and down. We\u2019ve seen it as low as mid-80%s. I think this quarter is about 88%. You can see that certainly rise in some quarters in some years. I think I framed it as it could be as low as an 80%-ish, maybe a little lower. It could be as high as 90% or 95%. So we\u2019re going to continue to focus on dividend growth. We\u2019ve got a 28% CAGR on our dividend growth since becoming a public company. It\u2019s the highest out there and we\u2019re all very aligned. We own 25% of the outstanding shares, so we sit right there with our shareholders and we\u2019ll continue to focus on strong FRE management fee growth, FRE growth and without a doubt,  of course, dividend growth.\nMike Brown: Okay. Great. Thank you, Alan.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question of the day comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. I\u2019m going to take a flyer on this one. Would you be willing to give any early read on the November first flows for the three flagship retail products?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: I think, Patrick, we may have to decline commenting. Those are SEC registrants and they have not filed yet. I think you heard earlier in the call we feel like we have very good momentum in the wealth channels quarter-over-quarter increasing and we think we have very good prospects, if not very strong prospects, for what we\u2019re going to see in the wealth channels in 2024.\nPatrick Davitt: Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Patrick.\nMarc Lipschultz: Well, thank you all very much. We really appreciate the time and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on strong, predictable, high growth and delivering those dividends to all of you. Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, everyone. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. To start off, we are pleased with our third quarter and LTM results. Marc mentioned this, but I want to reiterate that this is our 10th consecutive quarter. It's actually been every quarter since becoming a public company of both management fee and FRE sequential growth. The only alternative asset manager that has demonstrated this over the past two and a half years. And as Marc also referred to earlier, as you can see on slide five, our management fees have grown at a 42% CAGR since we became a public company. We're talking not just very good growth, but steady, consistent, resilient growth through what has obviously been a very challenging and volatile market environment. So let's go through some of the key highlights of our LTM results through September 30th. Management fees are up 32% for the LTM period versus a year ago, and 93% of these management fees are from permanent capital vehicles. FRE is up 26% for the LTM period versus a year ago and our FRE margin is right on top of our 60% target, which we continue to expect to be the target for the next few years. And DE is up 28% for the LTM period versus a year ago. Now I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts. As you can see on slide 12, we raised $2.9 billion in the third quarter and over the last 12 months, we raised $14.5 billion. I'll break down the third quarter numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised over $2.1 billion. $1.2 billion was raised in our diversified and first-lien lending strategies, including over $900 million raised in our wealth distributed credit income BDC, OCIC, returning to a pace we haven't seen since the first half of 2022. And approximately $1 billion was raised in our tech lending strategies, including approximately $300 million raised in our wealth distributed tech lending BDC, OTIC. In GP strategic capital, we raised approximately $100 million during the third quarter and in October, we closed on approximately $400 million for a GP Stakes co-investment vehicle with a longstanding and valued partner, which will invest side by side with our fifth and sixth GP stakes funds. In real estate, we raised approximately $700 million, approximately half of that in our sixth vintage of our real estate strategy and the other half in our wealth distributed non-traded REITs, ORENT. We have now raised over $2 billion of equity in ORENT since its launch a year ago, primarily through just one wire house and during what has been an exceptionally challenging environment for real estate. So we're pleased with those results. And since May, we have launched ORENT on a few additional platforms and have some meaningful launches ahead for the fourth quarter and into 2024. As Marc alluded to earlier, we continue to see strong institutional interest in our products and we are expecting a strong finish to the year in the institutional channel. As we have discussed throughout the year overall, as we head into the end of 2023, we continue to see fundraising tilting institutional for the year. In the wealth channel, we have continued to see solid interest in our strategies with steady increases again in our fundraising levels quarter-over-quarter and we believe that will continue to build on itself through the end of this year and into next year. We are very excited about where we can be next year. All in all, we've raised over $36 billion of fee-paying AUM since January 1, 2022. When I think about fundraising overall, we've always talked about how permanent capital differentiates us, because assets not leaving the system means that we have higher growth for the same amount of fundraising. Said another way, we keep more of the capital we raise than our peers. Putting some numbers around that, for approximately every $5 of fee-paying AUM inflows we bring in, we see just $1 going out in the form of distributions or redemptions. For our peers, on average, every $2 raised is met with $1 leaving their system, meaning half of their fundraising covers assets that are being paid out to investors in one form or another. That's a huge difference. It's a big advantage for us. In addition to the staying power of existing AUM and the benefit of ongoing fundraising, we have substantial embedded earnings that we will unlock over time. AUM not yet paying fees was $12.6 billion at September 30th. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees, totaling over $175 million once deployed. And as many of you will recall, we have over $200 million of management fees in aggregate that will turn on upon the listing of our private BDCs over time. We believe, in part because of these things and in part because of our permanent capital, we have a higher quality of earnings. Moving on to our credit platform, we had gross originations of $4.4 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $2.1 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $13 billion with $7.4 billion of net funded deployment. So as it relates to the $9.3 billion of AUM not yet paying fees and credit, it would take us a little over one year to fully deploy this capital based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. With that said, as Marc commented earlier, we have been seeing a considerable uptick in pipeline activity in our direct lending platform and believe the fourth quarter could be a much bigger quarter for deployment than previous quarters this year. Although the impact of management fees in 2023 will be nominal, it's a great place to start 2024. Our credit portfolio returned 4.1% in the third quarter and 17.4% over the LTM, while annualized realized losses remain approximately 6 basis points on a gross basis and have been fully offset by realized gains. Rated average LTVs remain in the low 40s across direct lending and in the low 30s specifically in our tech lending portfolio.  For our GP strategic capital platform, total invested commitments for our fifth GP Stakes fund, including agreements in principle, are approximately $11 billion of capital with line of sight into about $2 billion of opportunities, which if all signs would bring us through the remaining capital available in Fund V. And performance across these funds remain strong with a net IRR of 23% for Fund III, 46% for Fund IV and 21% for Fund V, all of which compare favorably to the median returns for private equity funds of the same vintages. And in our real estate platform, deployment activity remains robust with over $1 billion deployed during the quarter. And our pipeline of opportunities remained strong with over $4 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract to close. With regards to performance, we achieved gross returns across our real estate portfolio of 2.4% for the third quarter and 13.8% for the last 12 months. Okay, let's wrap up here with one closing thought, dividend growth. This year, we will have posted dividend growth of 22% over last year and since becoming a public company, we have achieved a 28% CAGR for our dividend, the highest in the public alternative asset manager space and we feel this is truly reflective of how we have grown our business. Dividend growth is our north star. It reflects our pace of growth, but also informs about the quality of the earnings underlying that growth and the confidence we have in the staying power of those earnings. It's a metric that captures all aspects of our business, including fundraising, deployment, revenue growth, embedded future earnings and so on. And for that reason, it's one of the metrics that we think investors should be most focused on for us. Thank you again to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that, Operator, can we please open the line for questions? Sure. Thanks, Craig. We are currently live on three platforms, three large platforms. We added one currently in the fourth quarter and we anticipate coming on one or more additional large platforms in one queue. The trajectory continues to look strong, again, in the face of incredible headwinds in the world of real estate, and certainly, relatively speaking, very, very strong flows that we've seen to-date. If you recall, we've raised about $2 billion primarily from really one wire house platform in the face of a number of things that have happened over this past year, and in the face of strong headwinds, as I said, in real estate writ large. So we continue to be cautiously very optimistic about continued trends up and to the right in what we can do with our ORENT product, in particular, in 2024 and forward. Thank you, Craig. Sure. Thanks, Alex. So we've talked about FRE margins. We think operating at a 60% FRE margin is a very strong margin. It's obviously among the best or the best in the industry. And as we continue to grow, Doug just talked about, some new product launches. As we continue to grow our business, we're going to continue to invest in that business, whether it's people, whether it's real estate, whether it's placement costs, whether it's comp. And so I would expect a high growth rate for our expense line, no different than for our revenue line. Obviously, ideally, our revenue line outpaces the expenses. But as we continue to reinvest in the business, I continue to think a 60% FRE margin is the right place for our business to operate for the next few years. When you think about what we're investing in, Alex, we think about healthcare, as Doug just mentioned, in terms of organic product launches. We think about our strategic equity product that we're in the process of launching. These are all organic that we're building from scratch internally here or that we have been building from scratch. Think about continued investment in our institutional fundraising platform, continuing investment in our wealth fundraising platform. These are all things that are critical to that revenue growth that we continue to talk about. And you pull the lens back and you think about how simple our business is. We've taken an FRE revenue growth number times 60%. FRE margin, that's our FRE growth and that translates to very high continued dividend growth year-after-year. Sure. Why don't I... Great. Thank you, Marc. So, Patrick, when we think about -- there's a number of different factors that all drive through what you're referring to, what your question is. When we have fundraise, obviously fundraise raises are AUM and fee-paying AUM. Generally speaking, we'll have some fee-free capital that we'll raise from time-to-time, like what we closed a little bit of in 3Q that goes to AUM but obviously doesn't accrue to fee-paying AUM. We'll have AUM going up for fair value increases that also doesn't accrue to fee-paying AUM. Gross deployment will. Sometimes we'll have paydowns during the quarter on loans that we originate that are paid back. That doesn't leave the system. That just needs to sit until it gets redeployed. And so you have different things moving different of those ratios up and down. And then you also have debt. So for us, there's a number of our products where we earn a management fee on debt, on total assets, so equity plus leverage. And when we raise debt in those products, that goes to fee-paying AUM. So they won't always move in sync, but generally speaking, you should see all of them increase over time. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Brian. I'll take the last part of that question. When you do go out to the dollar-shared dividend based on our Investor Day, you could certainly see both revenue growth and FRA growth for the next two years in the approaching 30% or 30%-plus range. I'll leave it to Marc to touch on the dollar-shared dividend and how we feel about that goal. And we'll typically look to the industry level of 75% to start thinking about the next follow-on fund. Thank you, Brian. Brennan, we haven't disclosed that. Sure. So all of our senior members of the management team, Doug, Marc, Michael, Marc Zahr, others, have been taking stock comp entirely for the last two-plus years, almost since we've been a public company. So that continues its tremendous alignment with our shareholders and you shouldn't expect a meaningful increase due to that. Thank you, Brennan. Thanks. Yes. You summed it up correctly, Mike. BDCs, SMAs on the credit side, CLOs, GP Stakes Fund VI and ORENT. And you're right, Fund VI will be largely wrapped up by then. There are new product launches that we talked about earlier that Doug and Marc hit on, whether it's healthcare. We have an interesting new real estate product or products coming out to the market in 2024 that we think we could raise some good dollars on. And some other strategies we haven't talked about to-date that we think could be interesting in 2024. Yeah. I don't think -- it's a great question, Mike. I don't think there's an evolution in the business. I have commented on previous calls that that number can move up and down. We've seen it as low as mid-80%s. I think this quarter is about 88%. You can see that certainly rise in some quarters in some years. I think I framed it as it could be as low as an 80%-ish, maybe a little lower. It could be as high as 90% or 95%. So we're going to continue to focus on dividend growth. We've got a 28% CAGR on our dividend growth since becoming a public company. It's the highest out there and we're all very aligned. We own 25% of the outstanding shares, so we sit right there with our shareholders and we'll continue to focus on strong FRE management fee growth, FRE growth and without a doubt,  of course, dividend growth. Thank you, Mike. I think, Patrick, we may have to decline commenting. Those are SEC registrants and they have not filed yet. I think you heard earlier in the call we feel like we have very good momentum in the wealth channels quarter-over-quarter increasing and we think we have very good prospects, if not very strong prospects, for what we're going to see in the wealth channels in 2024. Thank you, Patrick. Thank you, everyone. Have a good day."

            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Thanks so much, Doug. Today, we again demonstrated the steady and resilient growth that we believe sets Blue Owl apart in the alternative asset management space with our 10th straight quarter as a public company, also being our 10th straight quarter of generating FRE growth. When we think about what's happened in the world over that timeframe. This time in 2021 10-year treasuries were around 1.5% and a year ago, they just crossed 4%, with the expectation by the end of 2023, we'll be talking about rate cuts. Obviously, those expectations have shifted meaningfully over the past year. In the first three quarters of 2022, S&P 500 corrected 25% as interest rates marched upwards, only to reverse and rally 20% over the next year, despite elevated rates and ongoing geopolitical risks. The capital markets and M&A have been installed for the better part of the year, and in March, we witnessed a handful of bank failures that took the market completely off-guard. All of this is to say, the only thing that's been clear over the past couple of years is the lack of clarity into the short-term path of rates for the longer term impact of those rates on economic growth and how liquid markets will react to the information we have on-hand. In contrast, we've been able to demonstrate our Blue Owl permanent capital at FRE centric model by design, creates a differentiated and more predictable earnings profile. And on a last 12-month basis, we have grown DE by 28% and FRE by 26% despite of these market headwinds, since we've been public management fee growth has been over 40% per year. That's not to say that this growth has come easily, but one advantage we have structural is that very few assets leave our system, because our AUM is mostly permanent capital. So the capital we're raising is generally additive instead of replacing assets that are being returned to investors. On top of that, our business is positively levered to many of the ongoing secular tailwinds within alternatives, including the continued growth of direct lending, larger managers benefiting from ongoing consolidation across alts and private wealth's incremental adoption of alternatives as a core component of an investor portfolio. For these reasons, we feel confident that Blue Owl will remain a differentiated story with a differentiated growth trajectory. As it relates to the fundraising landscape, we continue to see very positive indications for demand across our strategies, which are generally income-oriented and downside protection-focused. Across our perpetually offered products and wealth, we raised $1.5 billion in the third quarter, a nearly 20% step up from the prior quarter. Over the last 12 months, we have been the top fundraiser in the industry in both credit and real estate when looking at net flows, and on a gross basis, we have been the second-best fundraiser over that period. Both of these are extraordinary statistics and I think testaments to the many years that we've been building our platform and relationships in this space. Now, a lot of firms are trying to catch up to where we are and given the size of the opportunity, this is not a zero-sum game. We and others can do well at the same time and there will be a lot of growth ahead across the industry. But I wanted to take a moment to recognize what we've been able to accomplish so far. I think we are exceeding expectations in the face of headwinds and I'm very enthused about what lies ahead for this business. On the institutional side of our business, we announced $1 billion mandate from a leading sovereign wealth firm, reflecting continued progress in the strategic and geographic expansion of our LP base. We have improving visibility into the end-of-year flows as we launch fundraising for a handful of strategies, including GP Stakes, for which we anticipate a small close for our sixth fund before the end of this year. We are very excited about the potential for cross-sell for this fund with our credit and real estate investors and we've seen strong demand to bring the GP Stakes strategy to a number of new wealth platforms as well. In real estate, we remain very well positioned, despite the substantial headwinds in this space. Having already reached our $4 billion target for this latest vintage of our flagship fund, getting to the $5 billion hard cap, which we expect to hit, will represent a doubling in the size from the prior vintage, a challenging feat even in strong markets and reflective of the distinctive and attractive attributes of our net lease strategy. And as I mentioned earlier, in the wealth channel, we are outselling competitors by a wide margin and we continue to build out that syndicate. And we remain engaged in a number of institutional investor dialogues regarding separate accounts and upcoming launches, some of which may close during the fourth quarter. Moving on to the business performance. In credit, we saw improving trends in deployment, with Blue Owl taking lead roles in some of the largest deals and refinancing announced or closed across the market, including Finastra and PetVet. Repayments during the quarter were elevated relative to levels seen earlier in the year, providing additional opportunities to redeploy capital at even more attractive levels. Overall, we continue to see our direct lending business expand as we meet the capital needs of an evolving marketplace. And the risk-reward opportunity presented by private credit today remains one of the best we've seen in our tenures as investment professionals, a sentiment that we often hear echoed back by our investors. In our GP Stakes business, we continue to witness the resilience of larger cap GPs, with these managers being the beneficiaries of market share gains during more challenging fundraising environments. In real estate, we've been active in deploying capital at attractive cap rates, with Fund VI about 20% committed or deployed and have continued to monetize at meaningful spreads to our entry points. Bringing all of this together, we think of our business as Alternative Asset Manager 3.0, meaning our business offers the steady stream of management fee-driven earnings that investors have been asking for in conjunction with the robust growth that they expect and we have a greater ability to keep assets in our system due to our permanent capital. Our financial profile is very simple and durable, and doesn't depend on realizations or capital market fees to drive earnings growth. As a premier solutions provider to a large and growing market, we think we offer a very attractive proposition of strong earnings and dividend growth underpinned by a core asset base that is exceptionally stable and we look forward to continuing to prove this model out to all types of market conditions. With that, let me turn to Alan to discuss our financial results. Hey, Craig. This is Marc. Thank you for the question. Look, this quarter is -- quarter four is expected to be a strong one from a fundraising point of view across wealth and institutional. We're seeing terrific strength in wealth continue to grow there. As you know, we've been the number one net fundraiser in the market and we continue to see substantial growth as we head into this month and this quarter. And then institutional as well with GP Stakes VI, we do expect to do our first close in the fourth quarter. And so I guess it leads probably to a broader point, which is to call it what it is, look, we expect fourth quarter to be very strong. This quarter, the timing between when things close for us is a little less predictable. We just don't run as many funds. So we don't like to get either overexcited about a particularly strong quarter or overly concerned about a quarter that's a little bit lighter. We look forward to long-term strong predictable dividend growth. We just don't run as many funds, as you know and we don't expect we will. Today, we have the highest fee rate in the industry. We run products where we are going to deliver superior risk returns and where we can build true scale, as you know, in really just about everything we do. We're a market leader, if not the singular market leader and that's going to continue to be our center of gravity. What we want to do is grow FRE and grow dividends, and of course, did that again this quarter, and we plan to do it again next quarter and keep on keeping on in that regard. So between wealth institutional and having a flagship product back in the market in Q4, we do anticipate it being strong. Of course. Thank you. I'll just add something to that and I -- linking kind of the two comments, my comment and Alan's comment, together. ORENT's a great example of a truly distinctive product in the real estate space and one where we see really substantial long-term potential and growth. It is a far more durable product. We continue to generate extremely attractive positive returns in ORENT during markets where people are maybe a little less discerning about risks, those distinctions don't appear significant. Then you get into a world of uncertainty and products that are really built for durability, which is the hallmark of what we do at Blue Owl, really sing. And that is in no small part why ORENT is by far the number one net fundraiser in the market and we are continuing to grow at a time when the word real estate is out of favor and that's exactly what makes the opportunity for ORENT and for us so substantial because we're delivering excellent returns in that market and frankly originating at really attractive cap rates with outstanding counterparties. So that is an area where I think you'll continue to see us. When we look forward, we think it's one of the most exciting areas we have. We see it on the institutional side, frankly, as well. We have already closed $4 billion for Fund VI, which was our target. We'll hit our hard cap of $5 billion and that'll be double the size of our last fund. And I'll mark it again where everyone else in real estate is going the other way. That's that kind of durability, predictability and product differentiation that's going to continue to be our hallmark and I do think ORENT in particular will be an extraordinarily attractive growth engine for us. It produces a great yield with great predictability and stability. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I'll tell you what, let's do this. Let me start on kind of what we're seeing in total in the marketplace originations, you're obviously driven from that and then Alan will connect in with some to kind of a specific question of how do you model it, so to speak. So your observation, of course, is absolutely spot on. The originations were up and measured in percentage terms up quite substantially at 30%. That's not -- that's pretty meaningful in the context of our business. That said, we're still at levels obviously below originations where they were a year ago, when times were much, much more active in the M&A market. So a couple of observations that remain true today. First and foremost, the direct lending role in the financing markets remains extremely substantial. And I don't know if you like to use the word market share. I'm not a big fan of the word market share because it suggests that, we and the banks are competing for the same financings. We're really not. We're offering a completely different value proposition and we're a holder, not an intermediary of debt. But in any case, just to use that word for a moment as a shorthand, the share for direct lending is extremely high and Blue Owl's role remains leading. We continue to be absolutely a key driving force in many of the very biggest financings for the very best companies and biggest sponsors. So all of that is very positive and in part reflected in the 30% growth. On the other hand, it is a statement of the obvious that M&A remains low in total and we can only have -- we can have as full a share as we all collectively want and Lester's M&A activity, it can only translate into so many dollars. And sitting here today, we continue to see good activity levels in terms of inflows. Certainly seems to be more convergence between buyers and sellers in converging on prices. Quality of assets is excellent. The things we are seeing, the things we are originating, the quality is outstanding. Now that may reflect our own origination and our own very, very selective financing choices. We've looked at 8,400 loans to make the 500 or so we have. But I think it also reflects the reality of the marketplace today, which is higher quality companies are what can be sold and higher quality companies are ones that can be financed, certainly by us. We focus on very high quality companies. And so I think in total, what we're seeing is a very, very strong position in a kind of tepid M&A market. It will return. One might have thought, a few weeks ago it would return even sooner sitting here now with the geopolitical world we're in. I don't know. You all have as good a perch as any. But we have had a -- continue to have a very nice pipeline of certainly very high quality product. And with that in terms of how to think about the flows the ins and outs. Maybe we turn it to Alan a little bit on that one. Other -- when you -- other closed-end fund wrappers meaning? Oh! Got you. Look, we have -- yes, we have a strategy of being, as you know, the market leader in large cap, high quality financing solutions. We have a model that's distinctive, which is anything we originate gets shared between the handful of funds that we manage. We have a much, much simpler business, both to understand, to manage, for infrastructure, as you know, than our peers and fewer different vehicles, as noted. However, in answer to your question, yes, we continue to look at ways to meet the market where they want us. That is to say, to meet structures that serve different constituents' needs. So, yes, we have continued to expand the types of offerings we have, to your point about other types of closed-end funds that may look like more traditional funds. Absolutely. We're pursuing putting those in place as well. We're all about creating the on-ramps that meet the needs of our investors so that that's designed for them and then delivering to all of them a common, high quality experience by being able to share in every loan that we make that's appropriate to a strategy. So that itself, as you know, is pretty distinctive. So we will continue to add those on-ramps into our product suites. Yes. I realize this isn't the question that you asked exactly, but I just want to add one other thought. Look, it is not our intention, though, to proliferate products so that we can just gather assets. We've said this before, we are keenly interested in growing FRE and dividends. We are not keenly interested in growing AUM for the sake of growing AUM. There's a lot of very low-margin AUM that's available, right? And so gathering assets, launching vehicles, we're just not going to pursue having dozens and dozens of vehicles just so we can get a dollar. What we want to do is get very high-quality dollars. Our fee rate is the highest in the industry and that reflects the quality of what we deliver to investors and the kinds of assets we raise and that, I think, will continue to be very important to us. We're not in the AUM gathering business. We're in the outstanding results and market leadership business. Thanks, Steven. Great. Thank you. So as noted and appreciated, obviously, we won't comment on any particular speculation in terms of M&A. But to say this, look, we as a firm, I would put in order three kind of priorities when we think about how we grow our business. Well, above all of it, of course, is delivering outstanding risk-adjusted returns at all moments, right? Our LP experience is monumentally important ultimately to us. It actually doesn't impact our financials, as you know, because we are a fee-based business. So our business is distinctively predictable. We don't have performance fees. But to us, delivering outstanding results will always be, lifeblood from our point of view. Now, with that said, there's three ways for us to grow the business, all three of which we have done and will continue to look at. But in this order, it is organic growth of our base product business, base products. Again, we have market-leading positions, decidedly the market-leading position in triple net lease for high quality -- high credit-quality counterparties, decidedly the market-leading position in GP strategic capital. And one of, don't want to overstate it, one of the market-leading positions in direct lending. And continuing to lead those markets is going to be our focus, continuing to have scaled products, which lead to very strong margins and strong fee rates because we have a great value proposition for those investors, is going to continue to be where we will focus first and foremost. And remember, because our capital is permanent, 93% of our revenues are based on permanent capital. So that growth, every time we bring in a dollar, we're keeping those dollars, we're a layer cake, not the spinning wheel, and as you heard us say, we'll take in, for every dollar, for every $1 that leaves our system by virtue of say a quote realization or a return, we have $5 coming in. Our average competitor has $2. That is a huge difference in growth impact in that organic phase. So that's going to be priority one. Priority two is add in products where we can ultimately become the market leader, a market leader, but most importantly, deliver a really strong experience. Take our Blue Owl strategic equity product. GP-led secondaries. Huge market opportunity. That's a place where we'll do our first close in Q4. We have a really distinctive solution. We think that could be a very large addressable market and we have a capability to originate, underwrite and make investment decisions that is truly distinctive and we think will allow us to deliver outstanding results. So part two, build new organic products. Doug just talked about healthcare. We can do in healthcare what we've done in software and technology. We have the capabilities. We've built out, you saw our acquisition of the common health business, finishes rounding out extremely deep intellectual capital and relationships to do that. Three and it is acquisitions. When we can find a business as fantastic as Oak Street, we're going to want to buy it and add it because it's incredibly accretive and additive in every sense. Marc Zahr is a brilliant investor and senior leader for this firm, and so that's an addition along with, obviously, terrific growth. It's been our highest growth business. So when we can find that cultural fit, strategic fit, we're going to do it. So I appreciate that was all a lot, but I do want to really talk about how we build our business going forward. As for, therefore, say, European direct lending. Well, look, strategically, it's a perfectly coherent place for us to be, right? We are a market leader in U.S. direct lending. Now, we like the U.S. market a lot. The risk return is very compelling in the U.S. market. Being in European direct lending makes perfect sense. Is it necessary? No, it's not necessary. If we can find the right platform, whether that would be organic or inorganic, I'd say in Europe it's more logically inorganic, acquired, given the scale and complexity of the marketplace. But it could be either over time. We'll look at both. And getting at that market is something that would be very logical and certainly something we're serious about. But we don't have to do it. We're only going to do it if we can do it really, really well and when we do it, we're going to deliver great results doing so and we're going to be disciplined about it. So that's kind of the framework when we think about European direct lending. Good business for us to be in on the right basis. It doesn't make our U.S. business better. It doesn't make Blue Owl better unless we can be a market leader and that's what we're focused on. With that said, and last question you raised about people and the kind of fee structure in Europe. Look, our fees are the highest fee rate in the industry for a reason, because we deliver great returns, and people are willing to and should be willing to pay for that. It's a net result that will matter for our investors. I can't comment on anybody else's specific strategy, but look, when you're trying to get into a market like direct lending where we're a leader, sometimes people can try to attack on price. I don't -- It's not part of the way we see the world. It's not part of the way we operate. But look, in every market where someone wants to get in or is trying to catch up, sometimes they'll may try price as a lever. Well, let's start with, I would say, how many years has it been that people have said, oh, the credit problems are coming, the credit problems are coming, we just don't know in direct lending, these sort of very amorphous and I'm not saying you're saying this, but these kind of amorphous, spooky-sounding questions, which I think, we can guess sometimes who the people are that advocate that story. Let's just start with a few facts. The fact of the matter is we haven't seen any uptick in defaults, any uptick in losses. In point of fact, we're still running at a 6-basis-point annualized loss rate since inception, all of which has been offset by realized gains and a bit more than that. Now, I appreciate and agree it's been a generally benign environment economically, but, I mean, we did have a pandemic. We have had a war in Ukraine. We have had rates rise dramatically and we've had many peers experience a lot more credit problems than we have. I'm not saying that with complacency or arrogance or anything like it, but at the end of the day, there are differences in the way we operate, the credits we pick, how we pick them. You noted the most important part from our point of view, which is loan-to-value. Having lots of cushions, both in percentage and absolute terms. Remember, when we're lucky enough to partner with Thoma Bravo and lead a financing for, say, Anaplan, not only is it a 70% equity check, it's a $7 billion equity check. Both of those matter in this calculus, percentage and scale, and that's why we focus where we do. So, with regard to default rates, let me just observe that the signs that will presage, that will come ahead of a meaningful change in default rates, those are not in any manner flashing yellow yet. That's not to suggest that there won't be a recession at some point. In fact, as credit people, it'd be crazy for us not to contemplate and plan for that. But today, our portfolio, right now, revenue and EBITDA on average across the portfolio grew 10% quarter-over-quarter. That is pretty robust. Now, that's partly the favorable selection of the kinds of businesses we underwrite, but pretty favorable. We aren't seeing any meaningful change in requests for out-of-the-ordinary course amendments. We aren't seeing any meaningful change in requests for PIC. We aren't seeing meaningful changes in running out of liquidity. So, I say all of that to say that we don't see any of those, not just warning signs, they sort of are checkpoints that have to happen before you get to meaningful defaults. Then you get to recoveries, to your point, which we couldn't agree more, in some regards is the critical item, because a default in and of itself isn't a problem. Now, we're better off to avoid them and we can count the number of defaults we've had literally on things like fingers. So, keeping defaults really low remains the most important thing we can do and will do. But when we've taken companies, our recoveries have been extremely strong and keeping loan to value is the way to ensure that. When you're running 40% of a purchase price in a loan, a fire sale still gets you your money back and that is really important. That's why we like these big, durable, strategic assets. We've said this from inception and there's been lots of questions along the way as we led the market toward this direction of lender of first choice going to the biggest credits, the best credits, why, lots of talk about all those, there's more opportunities in the small market, there's not. The opportunities to be in the big credits where you have that durability because they're strategic assets that someone will buy, even if they stumble, even if they get in trouble. And that, to your point, which we couldn't agree more, is all about maximizing recoveries. The last part you said was in these growthier businesses, software businesses. Actually, the reason we like those businesses is because the recoveries will actually be the highest in our view. Those businesses, if and when they have a problem, they still have enormous amounts of gross margin, right? These companies, the ones we finance and the ones that are bought have extremely high, let's set aside even the growth rate, assume that somehow has to get tempered if we're going to have one of these problems that you're talking about. But these are still businesses that have hundreds of millions of dollars of customers that are really for all intents and purposes dependent on the use of a piece of software with 80% to 90% gross margins. Taking that and consolidating it with another strategic owner of a software business is exactly the kind of way out that we're talking about. Someone wants that business. That is a valuable cash flow stream, unlike a traditional industrial business where let's suppose you're out in a deep cycle and nobody wants the capacity. Who wants a factory that doesn't have any use for its capacity? That's just not what you have in these software businesses. So, it's exactly why we like it. It's why, in point of fact, we have still not ever had a default in a software business, let alone a problem with a recovery. Thank you. Look, the dollar-shared dividend remains our north star. That -- we've just talked about this numerous times. We are about durability, predictability, FRA growth and dividend growth and the dollar remains our target. There's no doubt, it'd be silly not to observe we're in a more volatile world. We have been during the course of this year and now in the last few weeks, it's going to be kind of a wild eye not to say we're in an ever more volatile world given what's happening geopolitically. So, does that create incremental risk to that dollar? Sure, it creates some incremental risk, some incremental variability. But remember, because we're a permanent capital business and because we have very predictable fee rates and because we have all this capital that's already in the system that's being deployed, our model is extremely durable. So, the band around, say, the dollar is a tight band. We don't have performance fees and things that are going to drive meaningful variation. So, is there a little more risk to it? Sure, there's a little more risk to it. But that risk is very banded and it continues to be our north star is driving our way to that dollar. So, on the real estate front, we're very active. This is a good time for the triple net lease real estate business for a couple of reasons. One is, look, in a world with much less functional capital markets, the use of a real estate asset as part of a financing plan is more interesting to every kind of user. Remember, our partners in that business are people like Amazon and Walgreens and Starbucks. I mean, it's not as if these are people that have financial challenges, but using real estate versus where the world was a couple of years ago where issuing nearly free IG borrowings, that's changed, right? So, it creates more interest in these types of novel solutions. We are originating today at incredibly compelling cap rates, close to 8% kinds of cap rates for IG counterparties. So, we love what we're getting. The pipeline is very, very active as a result. We've already now deployed about 20% of Fund VI. And as I said, we're doing great on fundraising for Fund VI, perhaps no surprise, given that we've been able to continue to generate really outstanding returns in an asset class that many people have found they struggle with now. So, in terms of the exact pace of deployment, again, like anything, it will vary quarter to quarter, but I would call our pipeline in real estate extremely strong. So, we expect that to continue to be a pretty robust deployment arena for us. Thank you. So, with regard to Par-Four and then the more general question, I would -- per the framework I described, look, we will always look at acquisitions where they are additive or strategic, if you want to use that term. And Par-Four is a really great example of this build versus buy, organic. And I also think maybe it's sometimes -- not lost, but I think it's worth calling back out in the context of things like growth and fundraising versus AUM. The -- at the end of the day, we can launch CLOs and we can, like every other firm, use a bit of capital to do that or maybe even some cases firms a lot of capital to do that and that would lead to raising $1.6 billion and that would show up in our fundraising column. But instead, we'd say, look, we can, for what turned out to be really de minimis consideration, acquire these contracts, and instead of building them, in that case, buy them, and that actually is another $1.6 billion of fee-paying AUM, the jointer system. Now, again, I don't want to get over focused on AUM, but I do want to point out that in our system, we're constantly going to look at what is the best way to get those assets, the most effective way to do it, that is accretive for the continued growth and dividends of our business. So, Par-Four is a great example of substituting, I would say, an acquisition for very little investment in place of an organic build of the very same CLOs that we could have undertaken. So, that's there. Will we continue to add to that? Sure, opportunistically, we're happy to add to it. CLOs are a much lower margin business. Our specialty, without question, is in the world of private capital solutions, so you should not expect us to become a large liquid manager. That's a very different, lower margin business. Our products are much more distinctive in the world of privates. We stay focused on what we're really, really good at. But, yes, it's an area we can continue to add to. It's not an imperative for us to become particularly large in CLOs. Great. Yes. I'm happy to comment on both. Let me start with the Cowen HealthCare question. So Cowen HealthCare, another great example of being able, by virtue of our platform to grow both capability and add to our earnings simultaneously. As Doug commented, healthcare has been a very, very significant focus for us. We've deployed significant capital in healthcare lending, royalties, structured solutions and now, by virtue of adding the Cowen business, are adding in even greater depth on the pharma side. And in the pharma side of the business, of course, there's technical skills involved. There are knowledge that the Cowen HealthCare team has in spades. They've made investments in 60 different companies over time, pharma-centric companies. So by adding that capability, we now have added to a full spectrum of abilities within healthcare that will allow us to really take that business forward in life sciences over the next 20 years. In our humble view, it's going to be an area of enormous opportunity, much like info services was the last 20 years. Probably not a coincidence that we've been able to build the market-leading position in software lending and looking ahead to see an opportunity in healthcare with some similarities. So that is kind of on a chase for strategic reasons. But done the way we have, by adding Blue Owl and making Blue Owl a platform that people want to join, we have a team that said, look, this is where we want to bring our platform. The consideration was very, very minor for that business, because it was really about the team coming and finding a home. So what we have managed to do in that case is add to our capabilities terrific people and add $1 billion of assets and add earnings as a result. So it wasn't an or. We didn't have to go pay some huge price in order to get admission. Quite the opposite. We have a great team join us, get a team and assets and earnings. So that was really what's behind the Cowen business. Very excited about Kevin and his team. With regard to real estate. So on the real estate side, we've been able to continue to post attractive returns, because we have a very, very distinctive proposition. We don't do in real estate what other people do. We don't own things that have to be released. We don't own things that have vacancies. We don't own things where this inflationary environment and the expenses flow through to us. We have a vacancy. Now you also have the expenses. We have triple net leases, the expenses, the inflation that has obviously been occurring in the world. That's the responsibility of our tenant. Our tenants sign up with us for 20 years at a time. If you look at, for example, in Q3, just to give you a sense of the power of this model, because again, we offer a value proposition to our investors. We partner with the Walgreens of the world. We're not just out in the market buying from brokers, like, I've heard before, I can recall being in a setting where one of the leaders, one of the biggest brokers in the country said, we never sell anything to Blue Owl, because they originate at rates way higher, way more attractive than we sell at and you can see that in our practice. So if you look during Q3, for example, we purchased 71 different properties for over $1 billion at an average cap rate of 7.9% with a 16-year average lease. I don't mean to just spew numbers, but just think about that for a minute. Roughly 8% cap rate, 16 per year average lease, triple net. So we are not taking risks. In fact, we've made basically the equivalent of loans to mostly IG companies and we own real estate as a backup in the case that we needed it. At the same time, during the same period, we sold 16 properties for over $0.25 billion, $267 million to be precise, at an average cap rate of 5.4%. So we're buying at 8%, we're selling to 5.4%, generating on average a 31% net IRR and a nearly 2-time net equity multiple. So why do I say that? What I'm saying is our business and the role we play as a strategic partner to large corporates allows them to conduct what amounts to wholesale transactions, to get dollars that matter to them. Selling a store doesn't do any good. Selling a warehouse has limited impact. Having a true partnership with someone that has billions of dollars to offer them, that has value. So we can buy it wholesale. And then at times, we will go ahead and sell those properties and we consistently have at prices meaningfully better than the prices we acquire at. So you'll hear even in a very disrupted market, rising rates, real estate is disrupted. I mean, not that it's hard to describe a worse environment for real estate, but this is a pretty choppy one. We were buying it at 8 and selling at 5.4%. Thank you. Well, thank you all very much. We really appreciate the time and we're going to continue to focus on strong, predictable, high growth and delivering those dividends to all of you. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. It's been a pleasure to spend the last two years on these earnings calls with our shareholders and analysts. As we move through the transition of the Co-CEO structure that we announced earlier this year, we decided to take a divide and conquer approach to allow each member of the management team to leverage their time more efficiently. And so going-forward, you'll be hearing from Marc and Alan on our quarterly earnings calls, while, Michael and I will be taking a step back from this aspect of the business. To be clear, I'm not going anywhere. I'll continue to be very available and accessible and I look-forward to seeing many of you at upcoming conferences and meetings. That said, given the rapid growth that we've had at Blue Owl and what now feels like a pretty well-oiled earnings process. It feels like the right time for me to focus my attention more fully on the many strategic growth initiatives we have in the works right now. So with that, let me hand things over to Marc. Sure. I'm so happy I get a question. I was sitting here dying to speak. First of all, let me just say I'm not going anywhere and for better or worse, you're going to be stuck with me for a long time. I'm incredibly proud of what we've built and I think we're in the early innings of taking this business to a whole other level. And we've always wanted to create and I think we're executing on becoming one of the most unique alternative asset managers. And just for everybody listening, I really plan on just spending as much time as possible with our stakeholders, our LPs and shareholders. Look, we have a number of initiatives and I'm happy to offline to go into a lot of them. But let me just give you one that I think will resonate. About six and a half years ago, we saw a really interesting opportunity in the software space. It was a growing sector. There were no dedicated pools of capital there. We launched our first dedicated software lending product and today we have about $20 billion of capital focused on that sector. If you look what we've done in healthcare today, we've spent a lot of time working with buyout firms. We've done, I think, almost $14 billion of deals in the space and have a great track record. We've added expertise in Royalty Pharma. We've now -- we just made a small acquisition to add life sciences expertise and we're spending a lot of time thinking about could a dedicated healthcare product be comparable or the TAM is certainly bigger than the software space. So that's the kind of thing we're working on and where I plan to spend the bulk of my time. Yeah. I -- Alex, look, there is would be natural scale economies, to your point. But we continue to be very focused, not just measured in quarters or even a couple years, but many, many years on continuing to deliver really strong FRE and dividend growth and so we do want to continue to put some capital and some of our available revenue into starting new products. We've done a lot very successfully organically and we continue to want to do that. We want to continue to invest in building the infrastructure, world-class infrastructure, in our organization to be the best in the areas we're in. So, I think at already the highest margin in the industry, it's not particularly a priority to see how to make that higher relative to making sure we continue to grow revenue at an extremely attractive rate and therefore convert that into FRE and into dividends. I think I would just add here, Patrick, generally speaking, we have a wrapper for each type of distribution channel for each of our strategies. A lot of those wrappers will take both institutional and wealth clients and investors, but we do have GP LP structures that meet the needs for each of our strategies. Some of them are just not as scaled as, let's say, our BDC platform and so they don't drive the numbers as much, so you don't hear about them as much on these earnings calls. But we do have products that suit those needs. Good morning."

Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase, and interest in any Blue Owl fund. This morning, we issued our financial results for the second quarter of 2023, reporting fee-related earnings or FRE of $0.17 per share and distributable earnings or DE of $0.16 per share. We\u2019ve declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the second quarter, payable on August 31, to holders of record as of August 21. During the call today, we'll be referring to the earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning. So, please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to, Doug.\nDouglas Ostrover: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of results for Blue Owl, again demonstrating the steady and resilient growth that we believe sets us apart in the alternative asset management space. When we became a public company, the thesis that we laid out for our investors was a simple one. We would generate substantial growth through a variety of market environments, anchored by our base of permanent capital, and we would provide an earnings stream that looked much less volatile than peers, with earnings supported almost entirely by management fee streams. Over the past two years, markets have shifted rapidly from a zero interest rate environment and robust capital markets to over 500 basis points Fed funds rate and meaningful declines in M&A and public issuance. The world changed overnight multiple times, and many companies face sizable challenges as a result, including supply chain difficulties, inflationary pressure, and capital funding issues. Over this period, Blue Owl was able to step up and increasingly demonstrate the value of our capital solutions to a broad slab of partners. We provided necessary capital to businesses across nearly every industry in our credit business and have seen minimal credit losses as a result of our disciplined underwriting. Our GP strategic capital platform supported the continued growth of the private markets ecosystem. And in real estate, we offered crucial and scaled alternative solutions to large companies seeking liquidity and capital flexibility. It has always been our perspective, that robust private markets support the health of both public markets and the broader economy, and we feel these past few years have been a validation of that view. Also, over this period, Blue Owl strategies provided much needed recurring income, downside protection, and inflation hedging to investors. Our credit and real estate returns have been in the double-digits on a last 12 month basis contrasted against very volatile public markets. We believe the trust that we've built with investors is reflected in the $32 billion of fee paying AUM, we've raised so far in 2022 and 2023, which compares to our fee paying AUM of $61 billion at the end of 2021 are over 50% growth. This is substantial growth in any market environment, much less the one we've faced over the past year and a half and we continue to see strong demand for our strategies. In addition, the diversification of our business between institutional and wealth channels continues to serve us well, with roughly half of our fundraising over this period, coming from each of these areas. On the institutional side, last year, we completed or made significant progress towards raises for some of our larger funds such as our GP Stakes V and our second vintage of tech lending BDC. As for 2023, we'll be more diversified between separate account mandates, new product launches, and next vintages of smaller funds. In wealth, we have returned to seeing steady increases in monthly flows for our wirehouse distributed products, and we've continued to see very modest redemption requests from the small percentage of our products, which offer a quarterly redemption feature with just over a $160 million requested in the second quarter or 0.5% of AUM in those products. This compares to over $1.3 billion raised in those same products, another very solid quarter of net inflows. If you take a step back to look at our flows across Blue Owl, from the first quarter of \u201822, to the first quarter of \u201823, we saw nearly six and a half times more inflows than we did outflows. In other words, for every dollar that left our system as a result of distributions or redemptions, we raised almost $6.50. By comparison, our peers on average raised just $2 for every dollar that left their platforms. During robust fundraising periods, this dynamic may not be as noticeable, but in a more challenging environment, such as the one we've been experiencing, you can clearly see that the assets we raise, which are higher fee, are also relatively stickier, and that is the advantage of permanent capital. So, in summary, we continue to feel very well-positioned for many different market and economic environments, as investors seek trusted scaled managers to provide safe yield and differentiated returns. We continue to see LPs growing their all alternatives allocations and consolidating their asset manager relationships, and we are confident Blue Owl will be one of the beneficiaries of this long-term secular trend. All of this is captured in the steady yet extraordinary growth that we have achieved over the past two years, increasing AUM by a 140% and distributable earnings by a 110%. Recently, we completed a full rebrand towards a unified Blue Owl name. Going forward, the legacy brands of Owl Rock, Dyal Capital and Oak Street, will be known as Blue Owl Credit, GP Strategic Capital, and Real Estate platforms. This evolution marks another milestone in Blue Owl's journey, driving towards our long standing vision of synthesizing multiple complimentary businesses into a market leading provider of Capital Solutions. And we plan to continue adding to our capabilities, further broadening the ways in which Blue Owl can be valuable to our partners and the products that we offer to our investors. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc, to give you an update on our credit and real estate businesses. Marc?\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thank you, Doug. The second quarter was characterized by many of the same themes we saw earlier in the year with uncertainty around the trajectory of interest rates and pace of economic growth constraining overall market activity. In our credit business, we continue to deploy capital into high conviction, attractive opportunities providing essential capital for our portfolio companies. Over the last 12 months, we originated nearly $15 billion of loans providing crucial financing to the M&A market. And during the second quarter, gross originations were $3.4 billion with $1.4 billion of repayments, allowing us to redeploy capital into attractive high yielding opportunities. Gross deployment has slowed a bit in keeping with lower market activity with U.S. M&A down nearly 40% on a year-on-year basis. However, as we've highlighted in prior quarters, direct lending has continued to occupy a larger share of the market. We believe much of the market share the direct lending has taken over the years reflects a permanent shift in borrower behavior, driven by the value of our lending proposition namely the benefits of privacy, predictability, and partnership. Credit quality remains very strong. Despite a more challenging macro backdrop, we continue to see good revenue and EBITDA growth on average at the portfolio companies. We have not seen any meaningful change in our internal watch list, nor have we seen any material step up in amendment requests or non-accruals. Weighted average loan-to-values remain in the low-40s across our entire direct lending portfolio and the low-30s across our tech dedicated portfolio. Across the $78 billion of loans we've originated since inception, annualized realized losses have been approximately six basis points, and those have been fully offset by realized gains over that same period. With regards to performance, the direct lending portfolio achieved gross returns of 4.3% for the second quarter and 18.9% for the last 12 months. Moving on to real estate. We continue to see high levels of interest in our net lease strategy with corporate borrowing costs elevated and financing markets more challenging. Our pipeline of opportunities remains robust, with roughly $3.8 billion of transaction volume under a letter of intent or contract close and a near-term pipeline of about $30 billion of potential volume. Inclusive of announced acquisition activity, we have invested or committed all of the equity in our fifth closed-end fund and have started deploying capital out of our sixth vintage, which we've already raised $3.7 billion of capital. We expect we'll reach our hard cap of $5 billion in the second half of this year, which would make this fund twice the size of the prior one. And during the second quarter, we added a large wirehouse distribution partner for our perpetually offered real estate product and anticipate adding to this syndicate meaningfully through the rest of this year and into 2024. With regards to performance, we achieved gross returns across our real estate portfolio of 2.3% for the second quarter and 14.2% for the last 12 months. Despite the substantial increase in interest rates, we continue to buy assets with a significant margin of safety to where they trade on a marketed basis and monetize and meaningful spreads to our entry points, notable during a period when many in the industry are facing challenges in this regard. To contextualize this, during the second quarter, we've sold or signed letters of intent on over a $150 million of assets at an average cap rate of 5.6%, achieving net IRRs of 30% and net MoICs of 1.7 times. Taking a step back, what we've been able to achieve so far with our real estate business is indicative of our playbook for future strategic M&A, and how we look to create value for our shareholders. When we acquired this business, it had about $8 billion of fee paid AUM, and a year and a half later, we've achieved 60% growth. And as I mentioned earlier, expect to raise a next vintage fund, double the size of the prior [fund] (ph). In addition, we've launched a wealth distributed product in scale raising $1.7 billion in under a year despite asset class headwinds and outflow dynamics for our pure products. Over time, we expect this will be a tremendous growth vertical for Blue Owl, and we think this has a lot to do with our decision to approach real estate a bit differently from our peers. This is the same mindset with which we approach future M&A for Blue Owl, to find parts of the market that are less crowded where we can create unique value for our investors and accelerate growth and scale by bringing businesses into our ecosystem. With that, let me turn it to Michael, to discuss GP Strategic Capital.\nMichael Rees: Thank you, Marc. Our GP Strategic Capital business continues to serve as an important resource for the private market\u2019s ecosystem, providing growth capital to some of the largest and most diversified alternative asset managers. Most recently, we announced the minority investment in Stonepeak, a leading alternative investment firm specializing in an infrastructure and real assets with over $55 billion in AUM. With a robust and expanding pipeline, total invested commitments for our fifth GP Stakes fund including agreements and principles, have reached approximately $11 billion of capital or roughly 85% of the funds, and we currently have a line-of-sight into approximately $2 billion of new opportunities, which if all signed, would bring us through the remaining capital available in Fund V. Our focus on larger firms within the alternatives universe has positioned our platform well within the current fundraising environment. Of note, one of our managers, CBC, recently closed its latest flagship fund with 26 billion euros of commitments, surpassing its fundraising target and its private equity's largest ever buyout fund. Performance across our GP Stakes funds remained strong with a net IRR of 24% for Fund III, 49% for Fund IV, and 28% for Fund V, all of which compare favorably to the median return for private equity funds of the same vintages. Looking ahead, we are looking forward to launching conversations on our sixth vintage fund in our GP Stake strategy and continue to anticipate a first close in early 2024. Finally, I would like to address the rumors and speculation that have been in the press. I am 100% committed to Blue Owl\u2019s long-term success and will continue leading the GP Strategic Capital business. As a show of alignment for the long-term, I have elected to receive 100% of my compensation for 2023, 2024, and 2025 in Blue Owl equity. I look forward to continuing to drive value for our shareholders. With that, I will turn things over to Alan, to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter and the last 12 months, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation. So, please feel free to have that available to follow along. To start off, we are very pleased with our second quarter an LTM results, another quarter of strong industry leading growth. Some key highlights of our results through, June 30, include total revenues up 37%, FRE up 34%, DE up 32%, and our dividend is up 33%, all on an LTM versus a year ago basis. All of this was because we built our business differently than our peers. We built our business with the foundation of permanent capital and steady predictable management fee cash flows. So to step through our results through, June 30 in more detail, management fees are up $459 million or 46% for the LTM period versus a year ago. Broken down by strategy, credit management fees are up $272 million or 53%. GP Strategic Capital management fees are up $123 million or 28%, and real estate management fees are up $64 million or 175%. Keeping in mind, we acquired our real estate business at the end of 2021, so we don't have a full year in our prior year LTM results. This is obviously very considerable growth that we've been able to accomplish. Compensation expense came in at just under 28% comp-to-revenue for the LTM period. Overall, we are trending in-line with our guidance of our comp expense ratio sitting in the 25% to 30% comp-to-revenue range, likely towards the higher-end of that range, due to further growth and investment in our business. G&A expense came in at $192 million for the LTM period and $39 million for the quarter. Overall, we are trending in-line with our guidance of G&A expense trending up a little in 2023 from last year, with placement costs down and regular way G&A higher, driven by the overall growth of our business. FRE is up $227 million or 34% for the LTM period versus a year ago. So, with our comp percentage up a little, and our overall G&A percentage down a little, we continue to be right on-track with our 60% FRE margin target for 2023. And we announced the dividend of $0.14 per share for the second quarter. For the LTM period, we have paid $0.53 in dividends versus $0.40 for a year ago. That results in a 33% increase in our dividends. Now I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts in which the environment continues to prove challenging, but we're seeing some positive indicators, I'll talk about in a moment. As you can see on slide 12, we raised $2.9 billion in the second quarter. And over the last 12 months, we raised $20.4 billion, 19% above the prior year period. I'll break down the second quarter numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised over $1.5 billion. $1.3 billion raised in our diversified and first lien lending strategies, including almost $800 million raise in our wealth distributed core income BDC, OCIC. And over $200 million raise in our tech lending strategies, almost all raised in our wealth distributed tech lending BDC OTIC. In GP Strategic Capital, we raised approximately $200 million. And in real estate, we raised approximately $1.1 billion, approximately $700 million in our real estate Fund VI and approximately $300 million in our net lease trust product ORENT, our non-traded REIT. Although we had a lower level of institutional closes in the second quarter, we continue to see strong institutional interest in our products. And in the wealth channel, we have continued to see good interest in our strategies with steady increases in our fundraising goals quarter-over-quarter, and we believe that will continue to build on itself through the end of the year. Not only are the gross fundraising levels improving, but we continue to be very encouraged by the net fundraising levels we are seeing from our products that have quarterly redemption features. As Doug pointed out, we are still seeing strong net positive inflows with these products, with gross inflows for the second quarter running at about eight times the level of outflows for the small set of products we offer a quarterly redemption feature. All in all, we've raised approximately $32 billion of fee-paying AUM since January 1, 2022, and our overall fee rate is significantly higher than our peers at over a 150 basis points versus our peer average of below a 100 basis points. As we discussed on last quarter's call, overall, as we progress through 2023, we continue to expect fundraising to tilt institutional, although as I've said previously, timing is always challenging to predict. As it relates to our AUM metrics, on slide 11, AUM grew $30.5 billion to $149.6 billion, a 26% increase from the second quarter a year ago. Fee-paying AUM grew $16.1 billion to $93.6 billion, a 21% increase from the second quarter a year ago. Both metrics are driven primarily by capital raised and deployed in credit. Capital raised in GP Stakes Fund V and capital raised in real estate Fund VI, [ONLT and ORENT] (ph). Permanent capital grew $23.1 billion to $118.6 billion, a 24% increase from the second quarter a year ago. As a reminder, 93% of our management fees are from these permanent capital vehicles. AUM not yet paying fees was $12 billion including $8.1 billion in credit, $1.1 billion in GP Strategic Capital, and $2.8 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees, totaling over $170 million once deployed which equates to a fee rate of 1.4%. In credit, we had gross originations of $3.4 billion for the quarter, and net funded deployment of $1.6 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $14.6 billion with $9.2 billion of net funded deployment. So, as it relates to the $8.1 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in credit, it would take us approximately one year to fully deploy this capital based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Deployment has obviously been running at a much slower pace, so there could be some upside to this. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on slide 17, we currently have a significant amount of liquidity with an average 13-year maturity and low 3% cost of borrowing. So, summing it all up, another strong quarter of growth for our business. As it relates to our 2023 goals that we spoke about at our Investor Day in May of 2022, we continue to track well against our goals of $1 billion of distributable earnings and $50 billion of fee paying AUM. We are currently about one quarter behind our original target timeline in achieving these 2023 goals, which we are very pleased with considering the market and fundraising environment we've all been in. And standing here today, we continue to see our path in achieving a $1 per share dividend for 2025, driven by continued strong FRE growth anticipated for the next two and a half years. We are very pleased with our results. We delivered exceptional growth in all of our key metrics. AUM, fee-paying AUM, management fees, FRE, and DE, and expect to see continued strong growth for the foreseeable future. Thank you again to everyone who's joined us on the call today. With that, operator, can we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thank you. So I appreciate all the commentary. I wonder if you can help us aggregate in terms of your comments on first closed for GP, the next net lease fund being twice a size. And maybe any guesstimates on private credit, maybe just lump that into, I don't know, next 12 months, what kind of numbers does that add up to? And then when thinking about the part of it is market related cyclicality, part of it is rate related cyclicality. But when thinking about the cyclicality of your current mix of business, how do you think about broad or are you thinking about broadening the platform in an effort to reduce that cyclicality? Thanks so much.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Glenn. Appreciate the question. Good morning. When we think about our flagship real estate product, Fund VI, we are still fundraising there. We do expect to hit our goal of $4 billion, but we think we can bring that to a $5 billion close, that would double the size of Fund V. So we're super excited about that, especially in the market environment we're in, especially with the real estate sentiment, that's out there right now. GP Stakes Fund VI, we've surpassed the 75% invested. We expect to be out with investors, in the back half of this year, and we expect that we can do a closing in early next year, and maybe we can accelerate that, but let let's see how the next couple of months go. So we're excited to raise a big Fund VI there, and we think -- we certainly have the fund performance to -- that we're excited about to go out to the market with. On the credit side, we're seeing a lot of interest in the credit products as we've talked about previously. And I'm happy to hand that over to Doug, to elaborate.\nDouglas Ostrover: Yes. Thanks for the question. So look, when you mentioned the word cyclical, we don't really view it as cyclical. It's really just more fundraising, it\u2019s episodic. And when we talk about being a quarter behind, it's really I got to get the exact number, but it's just a few billion dollars of fundraising have a big impact on that delta. But maybe I can just address it, in a little more detail. Look, the pipeline looks really strong, and as I said, it's hard to predict timing, but we are seeing a lot of enthusiasm for the strategies. So, let me just start maybe with private wealth and then I'll roll in to institutional as well. Remember, the funds, they generate a lot of income. They're downside protected. It's definitely resonated. If you look on the wealth side for continuously offered credit products, I think we were up 32% quarter-over-quarter. Now one quarter certainly doesn't make a trend, but we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in our wealth credit strategies and we're expanding the syndicates. Real estate across the industry, I think, because there have been redemptions in funds, lots of chatter about office, real estate quotes have definitely been slower, but we're starting to see some real excitement about our triple net lease strategy, and we're going to have some meaningful growth to our syndicate this quarter. So, I'm really excited, as you know, about what we can do with this product. We're seeing it on the institutional side, and I think now on the wealth side, we're going to be able to grow. Most importantly, we've had minimal redemptions across all of our products. So, in wealth, we're very, very excited about this channel. Again, it's just one quarter, but I'm cautiously optimistic. On the institutional side, we're still seeing a tremendous amount of interest in our credit strategies. But you have to remember, this is a bit of a strange quarter for us. We're not in the market with any flagship funds. And as you know, we just finished raising $8 billion of fee-paying assets at very high fees for our Tech II product. And so, the way I would think about is we will be in the market with new credit products over the next few quarters. We've already gone out, talked to investors. We're seeing a lot of interest. If I think about this quarter and last quarter, the best way to think about what we've been doing is we're really dealing with more bespoke mandates, really more SMAs. And it's really hard to predict the timing on those. And by the way, these SMA's are large, but it's not like we have fund and we can say the timing is we're closing August 31, you have to be in. These are much more negotiated. And I think between now and the end of the year, you'll start to see some of those hit. And as Alan mentioned, we'll finish up fundraising in real estate VI. We're in the market with our continuation fund and we expect to be in the market with GP Stakes, Fund VI as well. Since I have the mic, I can't help myself. Just one last thing. I know everyone is very fixated on asset growth, but we'd like to start changing the conversation a little bit to the type of assets we're raising and why we're different. Our average fee today is about 1.6%, our average management fee. When I look across our peers, many are at 1%, but many are well below 1%. So, not every dollar raised is the same. And in addition, our capital doesn\u2019t leave, as Alan touched on. So, we're really excited. We think the trajectory and the destination are still really strong. And, I have more to say on fundraising in the upcoming quarters as we launch some of these new credit funds.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: And I want to amplify one last thing, which Doug commented on earlier, but just touched on again, which is the nature of the capital. Again, just as we set out to build this business, we really did set out to build a very different kind of ALT's management firm. And I mean, in this context, as a shareholder in terms of the business model, so quality of assets, the fee rate on the assets, the value add, if you will, on the assets, really important. As is that duration, and remember we talked a little bit earlier for every dollar that leaves our system, we are raising $6.5. That's literally multiples of our peer set, and it relates to the fact that we have permanent capital, so you don't have the dollars flowing out, but we do have dollars flowing in. So, when you think about what those two things combined mean for the power and trajectory of this model, and the predictability of that trajectory, set aside any given quarter or quarter-to-quarter, but predict that the steepness of that slope and the predictability of its destination when you have the 1.6% fee rate and $6.5 being raised for every dollar that exits the system, it really is a different business model.\nGlenn Schorr: All right. Thank you for all that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Hi, Doug, I was hoping we could build a little bit more on the discussion around how you're thinking about building out institutional credit business for you guys. So, you mentioned SMAs, new fund launches, and obviously there's some next vintages albeit from smaller funds. So, can you help maybe contextualize what that looks like in terms of the pipeline size, LP types, kind of how that's evolved? Just a little bit more meat around the bones, could be helpful there because it's sort of opaque in the context of the whole firm. And it sounds like it could be bigger business for you guys, but some incremental color would be helpful there.\nDouglas Ostrover: Yes. Listen, As I think about the credit business, in particular, remember in the past, we've done, which has been a good strategy, a lot of BDCs, and now we're transitioning into some more longer duration GP LP strategies. And so, the most obvious, we will be in the market with a diversified strategy really geared towards the international markets. Not going into too much detail, coming up with a structure that really works well. And then, I'm happy, we're not ready to disclose it, but just like in Tech, I think today, we are about $16 billion, $17 billion dedicated software capital. I think you're going to see us launch, other industry verticals that we think could be quite large. So, combination of moving, we're going to do other BDCs, but also introduce more GP LP funds where we can be in the market on a more regular basis. If you think about our peers, they do Fund I, the money leaves, they come back with Fund II. Our BDC is the capital doesn't leave, but there's not always the opportunity to come back with the subsequent funds. So, we'll start to build more of that GP LP sequence and more industry focused funds.\nAlex Blostein: Got you. All right. Thanks for that. My second question maybe is around the real estate business, kind of a two part of there, so I apologize. But I guess, one, an update of where you guys are with adding to the syndicate. It sounded like you plan to add more this quarter and just generally in the back half. But overall flows in the retail channel, for the real estate products have been a little softer, maybe comment in your expectations there. And then when we look at the Fund VI, where are you guys in terms of deployed capital in that fund and how frequently do you ultimately think, the LP GP style funds there could be coming back to the market, seeing how you guys I think are one of the largest players in that market and you could deploy that capital pretty quickly.\nDouglas Ostrover: So, let me start with the syndicate. I think we are planning to launch on two very large wires. As you know, we've been primarily in one wire, where we've had really meaningful market share there, and we are about to launch on two new wires. I think we've raised about $2 billion, just under $2 billion to-date. Look, I think this is a really exciting product. It's tax advantage. It generates high current income. I think you heard in our comments, even in this rising rate environment, we've been able to sell assets and generate meaningful capital gains. So, I'm really optimistic about where we can take this product on the wealth channel. And, over the next couple of weeks, hopefully, we'll announce who the two big wires are, but we're basically done there. And then, on the institutional side, I'll let Marc comment on where we are in terms of deployment and when we can be back in market.\nMarc Lipschultz: Look, it's a good environment, Glenn, to your point about, just behind this question, it's a very good environment for what we do in triple net lease. And I say that both from a fundraising point of view because, of course, it's a very predictable, stable, safe product space, but also users of the capital in a world of corporate costs rising, uncertainty about capital availability, triple net lease looks like a -- looks like a fantastic option for many corporate users. So anyway, with regard to the Fund VI, Alex, we have $3.8 billion in the pipeline as we mentioned in our remarks. So, if that comes to fruition, now remember, we do use leverage. So, if I just rough out the math, turn of leverage for a turn of equity, then assuming we hit our $5 billion target, that's $10 billion of purchasing capacity, but $3.8 billion of signed agreements is not a small increment toward that goal, and we have $30 billion in the broader pipeline. So, I'm not -- by any means, we're getting ahead of ourselves, but we're still raising Fund VI. So, we're not here to talk about Fund VII, but we really do have a distinct proposition for the market. We're the very, very clear market leader in triple net lease for strong credit worthy and IG counterparties and demand interest in both the product and the use of the capital is growing. So, we're very excited about this, we're very excited about this channel and much like direct lending over the last year, I think we're now in the year or the period of time where there's this recognition that not all real estate is created equal, not all strategies are created equal. And, again, I think this speaks to the distinctive nature of the Blue Owl business. We really take a view of whatever we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re looking for ways to reduce risk, reduce volatility, increase predictability and basically deliver the same or better returns with lower risks and lower volatility. And triple net lease is shining through. Take a look at our returns for the last 12 months in triple net lease, our triple net lease business in a world of obvious real estate, maybe habit would overstate the case, but it's a pretty chaotic market out there. And we've delivered a 14% return in our real estate business, because of the safety and security and nature of what we do.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: I would just add, Alex that all three of our platforms have very strong growth that we've experienced since our IPO and for the foreseeable future. We expect that to continue the real estate platform. We continue to expect to have the strongest growth of the three platforms.\nAlex Blostein: All right. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. Good morning, Doug, Alan. Hope you guys are doing well. My question is on the international markets. Asian Sovereign Wealth Funds, European Pension Plans, Asian Private Banks, it seems like you have a lot of upside potential with these very large pools of capital. So, including and excluding the potential for GP LP drawdown funds, which you just comment on, can you provide your perspective on current penetrations and the total growth potential for Blue Owl with non-U.S. investors?\nDouglas Ostrover: Good morning, and thanks for the question. I think you're right. It is a massive opportunity for us. I actually spoke to the firm last night about this. We are really starting to see some significant penetration throughout Asia and the Middle East. And, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but as we, for example, as we round out Fund VI in real estate, I think the bulk of that will come from overseas investors and certainly, it's a big area of focus for us. We've spent a bunch of money building out the team throughout Asia, specifically in Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore. And so to answer your question, I think we will -- as I've always said, I think we will get more than our fair share from those markets.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks, Doug. My follow-up's a quick one. How many large wealth management platforms should we expect Oak Trust and ORCIC to be on by year end?\nMarc Lipschultz: I think the answer to that, Craig is, we continue to -- we're starting from one, right, on the real estate side. So, we certainly see that increasing significantly over the next, say six to 12 months. By year-end is a little harder to triangulate. We've got a couple new ones that we're onboarding, over the next several weeks months. So, we're going to see a significant growth on the real estate side. I almost said OCIC, to get the right new acronym, is a much more mature product that is on a lot more platforms. So, it's got quite a running head start, on our real estate REIT. But we continue to add platforms where we can opportunistically there as well. So, I certainly see a few being added over the six to 12 months.\nDouglas Ostrover: Yes. I think the best way to think about it, and I'm sorry I can't give you a number because I'm trying to run through it in my head. But I think we're going be able, and I don't want to put -- I don't want to say it'll definitely happen within six months. But I think, basically, we will be on virtually every major platform in the market with one of our products, which is really significant. And so there have been a few firms that have been somewhat elusive, and we haven't been able to get on. And now they've agreed to put one of our products on. So, I look, we view ourselves as a clear number two player in this marketplace. And I'm, as I said in my comments and early on, we've always been excited about it, and our penetration continues to grow, and we remain, very optimistic about what we can do.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Doug.\nDouglas Ostrover: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi, good morning, everyone. First one, I imagine the pace of credit deployment is at least a part of the reason you're running a quarter behind on the DE target. So, through that lens, it does seem like we're starting to see a pickup in some bigger announcements. So, could you frame how the direct lending pipeline trended through 2Q and how you feel about second half deployment relative to one half deployment, now that it feels like things are unlocking a little bit. Thank you.\nDouglas Ostrover: Yes. Deployment certainly is part of it. And, we certainly can't defy the M&A cycle as I commented, but direct lending share and our share in particular continues to be really strong. We like where it positions us as the M&A cycle takes the other turn, and it does seem to be firming mean, there's a little doubt our activity and activity in large opportunities has been accelerated. So, it hard to predict that to any given month or quarter, but the movement is the correct direction. Yes, I think you saw out this morning the buyout of New Relic and Blue Owl was leading that financing. Again, our leadership in the world of software, I think continues to shine through. These are great opportunities for us, significant -- and, again, sort of significant signs of life, again, would probably overstate because frankly wasn't that it was more abundant before in these markets, but it's picking up. So, yes, I think another one of the reasons to sort of feel good as we turn into the back half. But again, well, we restate that so as not to get trapped into an excessively quarterly cycle. But, as we turn into the sort of next six and 12 months, yes, it does seem like activity is picking up nicely. And I think there's an awful lot of pent-up demand for PE deployment. And we're in a great position to garner a very large share of that.\nPatrick Davitt: Thank you. And my follow-up is a little higher level. It looks like, Europe could finally be picking up some share in direct lending. So, could you update us on your appetite to get much bigger there? Do you think you could do that organically, or do you think you need to buy something? Thank you.\nMarc Lipschultz: So, let me start with, look, we love the markets we're in. The U.S. market has served very well. It's by far the most robust and largest of course. And very important, I never ever want to not want to miss start any conversation about credit without credit quality. And the credit quality for both the opportunities and the way we have particularly built into this market, over $78 billion of originated credit, our running loss rate is six basis points. And in software, we have never had a loss. So, I put that first and foremost in any decision we make. And that said, do agree that Europe is much like other capital markets sort of starting to follow suit with the U.S. and that presents an opportunity. I think we will look to attack it both ways. We already do a tremendous amount of business with the firm. I mean, these are all global firms and in many cases, even European based firms. So, in our GP Stakes business, for example, we own stakes and firms all over the world, including, for example, CBC, who just raised the world's largest bio fund. So, our network, our ecosystem certainly spans well into Europe. So, organically we already do episodic opportunities there, we readily can build organically by putting more origination resources. It's the same credit work, of course, we have well over 100 people doing credit work. So organically, I think we can and will continue to sort of participate or look to accelerate our participation. But, we're open to an acquisition in the world of lending in Europe. It would be of course a jump start and with the right team and the right platform, we can do as we just talked about with the former Oak Street. Now, real estate business, I think we can do some pretty special things, when we integrate into the Blue Owl platform. So, certainly open minded about it, but otherwise or in addition, we'll pursue it organically over time.\nPatrick Davitt: Helpful. Thanks.\nDouglas Ostrover: Thanks Patrick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning all. It would be great just to get some more color on your new PE secondaries business. You made a senior hire earlier in the year to run this business. So, could you talk about this higher? Why now is the right time to start building out this business? And then what the opportunity is longer term in both the retail and institutional channels?\nMarc Lipschultz: So, we've actually made multiple hires now. So, indeed, we started with, great leadership with Chris Crampton, a multi-decade veteran of the private equity industry. But we've actually, since now, three more people that have joined that team. We have more coming. We've assigned additional internal resources. We have a fully built capability to address what we think is a very, very large opportunity. So, what are we doing specifically in the secondary at all, what we're really supporting are our partner firms, that is to say all the 600 firms that we finance today are the 60 firms we own stakes in and offering them another private capital solution in this Blue Owl ecosystem. People have wonderful assets they bought. I can tell you, I personally have been in private equity since the 90s. And since that time, people have talked about, look, the thing about private equity is you buy a great business, you find out it's a great some number of years later, but then you have to sell it. Everyone wants to keep them. So, GP led secondaries, continuation is the solution to this challenge. It allows the GP to maintain ownership, and as they know well, can manage well and know as a lot of value to create liquidity as an option, but not an obligation for the LPs. So that's flexibility, crystallize returns for prior funds. So, it really is a way of meeting the needs of a lot of different stakeholders in private equity, and there's trillions of dollars of assets. So, just ask yourself this, any given firm, if you could pick one asset to keep managing and owning, compounding your -- carry an opportunity on what would it be? We're here to facilitate people keeping those assets with this strategy. And it's a very distinctive strategy. Because remember, this is what we do every day for the private equity community. We finance the GPs. We finance their portfolio companies. We're adding another solution in that trusted set of partnerships we have, we say, here bring us your trophy asset or we'll elicit from you your trophy asset, and you can continue owning it and we'll provide some liquidity for those who choose not to go forward. We think it's a very, very substantial opportunity and meets the needs of a lot of people in the market today.\nDouglas Ostrover: Yes. And if you think about how our business our entire model is really set up to be a solutions provider. We have 650 PE firms we cover. On the credit side, we have stakes and over 60 private markets firms. And we're not in the PE business. We're not a competitor. And so, we've gone out and they've said to us, our most pressing need, as Marc was saying, is how do we hold on to our best assets longer? And we think we are we can come in and provide that capital. And I have to tell you, when we look at the market, when we look at the demand from these PE firms to hold on to these assets, the demand for capital is enormous. The supply of capital is de-minimis. And whenever you're in an environment, where the demand is so much greater than the supply of capital, we think we can generate outsized returns for our investors. In terms of fundraising, we are dual tracking it. We're in the institutional market. We're also in the wealth channel. Let's just focus on wealth for a minute. Think about the average investor trying to access the PE market. Maybe they can find one firm, two firms. Usually, it'll be one of the big brands. But we're going to give them a way to come in. We'll go out we're going to say these are the top 150 firms, and we're going to focus on the deal flow from those 150 firms. They'd never be able to get that kind of access. And so, we think we're going to create a better way, especially for the wealthy investor to invest in PE. And, it's early days and, it's not going to have a huge impact on \u201823 numbers, but as Marc alluded to, the [TAM] (ph) here is very, very large. And I think if we come in and we execute and we think we can generate top quartile result, totally better. I think we can create something potentially that's going to be quite large.\nBrian McKenna: Great. Thank you guys.\nDouglas Ostrover: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Beatty : Thank you, and good morning. Just want to follow-up on credit deployment. On the one hand, you've got strong kind of secular tailwinds, and then as Marc mentioned, some choppy deal activity recently, I want to ask about two other aspects. One is, the slower slash episodic fundraising and, IE capacity constraint and how much that might play into the recent deployment trends and whether some of the near-term fundraising that you talked about might loosen that up. And then also just in terms of, pricing and the cost of funds, whether you're seeing any hesitancy on the part of borrowers, just as that's so elevated these days. Thanks very much.\nMarc Lipschultz: So, Adam, thank you. In terms of activity, I think the fundamental constraint activity has really been just absolute market levels of activity. Our share is high. Our role is distinctive. Blue Owl really plays a pretty special role in that capital solutions center. But at the end of the day, there's only so much activity. The activity has been uptick in as we just talked about. We have capacity, but I will say we and the industry, it's not excess capacity, that is to say, we've talked about this before, the dry powder and private equity very much outmatches the dry powder in private credit. And so, well, I will certainly not suggest that the slower deployment in Q2 was a lack of capacity to deploy capital, I would equally say it's not as if we have excess capacity. Fundraising will continue to be very important to having adequate firepower to support the private markets ecosystem. And, as we continue to go through these disruptions in the banking system, and disruptions in syndicated markets, I think what probably all can take away is to have a healthy economy and to have a healthy capital market system, we need a healthy private lending system. And it's -- thankfully it's very healthy today, but it can use more capital. And that's what we've been talking about and are pursuing, and by putting together GP LP, format funds by accessing the foreign markets. As Doug talked about, places we just have underpenetrated over time, we think that can help us get the capital that not just that we need to pursue our business, but frankly the market needs to have a healthy flow of capital and a healthy available leverage pool.\nDouglas Ostrover: Yes, Marc talked about the demand from PE versus supply of capital. And I think one thing that is not discussed a lot is, the big players like ourselves who were sitting with these large capital bases, when rates were lower and M&A was robust, we could have 20%, 25% of our loans get refinanced in a quarter. So, we had so much money to deploy because you take what's refinance plus what's coming in. Today, there's very little being refinanced. There's very little M&A. And so, what we have to put to work is really just new capital coming in. So, it's a very good time. And look, the positive for us, our returns are basically on an unlevered basis, have gone from 6%, 7% to about 12%. So clearly, PE firms have to use less leverage, because the interest burden is that much greater. But look, as Marc said, its deployment is really driven by M&A volumes right now. And it feels like it's picking up, but it's too early to tell.\nMarc Lipschultz: And to your latter question about, it is the absolute cost of capital or the higher cost of capital impacting PE appetite or activity. And I don't want to pretend I know all decision makers decisions. But I would say at a meta level, no, at the end of the day, that's math, right. That gets into the clearing price of an asset. If you know what your cost of capital is and remember, one of the great strengths of direct lending is predictability. We tell you the terms, you know what it will cost. That's positive. Then you can price that into your investment decision. So, I think it speaks more to how you have to price equity transactions and that probably have led to the slowdown when you get these gaps between, what buyers want to pay and sellers want to take. But over time, markets function, and it'll just price in this cost of capital. It will probably mean less leverage to Doug's point, and that'll probably mean lower purchase prices for certain assets, but that all can be solved by change in the numbers on the, so to speak on the page. So no, I don't think cost of capital, cost of debt is likely to provide any meaningful drag. You've got $1.5 trillion of private equity dry powder. Private equity has shown its ability to thrive in high rate environments, low rate environments, strong economies, weak economies, it's good asset class, and it'll be a good asset class going forward.\nAdam Beatty : Very much appreciate it. Thank you, both.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to follow-up on Patrick's earlier question, and in terms of activity, to what extent was April an outlier and thus a drag on originations for the quarter? And then to what extent is competition from the banks reemerging in the sponsor direct lending market. And, would you expect as competition sort of reemerges that this will impact sort of pricing, and what you can kind of get on, on your transactions?\nMarc Lipschultz: The value proposition for us in direct lending is about predictability, privacy, and partnership. I mean, of course, the syndicated market matters. Of course, around the edges people are making decisions that include the fact that in the syndicated market, you might very well be able to achieve better terms, so to speak, as a borrower. But what does better mean? If you're a private equity firm making a long-term decision, I would proffer that the incremental cost of capital for private debt and incremental involvement, depth of diligence, stricter agreements, all of those things are well worth it to have the partnership and the predictability of capital. So, yes, I hope the syndicated markets will return. It's still pretty nascent. We don't see it as a meaningful factor in the marketplace today. It's not meaningful to our business today. But I hope this syndicated market returns. It's not a win-lose proposition. I'm not sure sometimes why whether, alternative asset managers on one hand or banks on the other, kind of turn toward each other and say, oh, well, if I'm winning, you're losing. I think they're about having multiple solutions in a marketplace. We need capital depth, capital depth to unlock M&A. And, we'd be glad to have this syndicated market's return and facilitate a more robust M&A environment. And frankly, there's a lot of things that syndicated market will finance. We won't. We don't finance deep cyclicals. We don't finance businesses that have extreme customer concentration. We don't -- there's a reason that we've been able to deliver six basis points of annualized loss, because we do very specific kinds of credit selection. So, we're not here to solve every capital structure, but for great firms buying great businesses who want a great capital partner, we're here to solve that. So I think it hasn't meant much yet, yes, the banks are probably open a little bit for business now. But, we hope they'll come back sooner and in fuller force. We're quite happy to compete in that arena. We deliver solution that is worth it for the people that use our capital.\nKen Worthington: Fair enough. And then just on April, was April bad enough that it impacted the overall quarter or was it really not that big an outlier?\nMarc Lipschultz: Sorry. What specifically about April do you mean?\nKen Worthington: In terms of, you're sort of in the hangover period from the sort of mid-cap banking crisis, deal activity seems to be on pause.\nMarc Lipschultz: Oh.\nKen Worthington: Like, did that -- from your perspective, was that enough of an outlier to what -- I guess maybe it was an outlier in the first place. And if so, was it enough an outlier to impact the overall origination numbers for the quarter, and if we exclude that, do things look better than they would have if April was normal. That's where I was going.\nMarc Lipschultz: I understand where you're coming from. I can't answer that with any precision, our business unlike trade in markets, the rhythm is not measurable in weeks, maybe not even months, depending on the particular timeline of a transaction. So, I think it would be right for me to say, Oh, okay, well, March directly impacted April. However, there is little doubt that the hangover the malaise, the disruption of the May, I don't bank crisis, mini crisis, certainly impacted markets are included in the sense that it just kind of froze up, right, the system froze up, people froze up and anything that people were deciding on by and large probably got deferred. So I know measure could be a scientific or prescriptive is that I appreciate the nature of the question. Safe to say Q2 suffered from a lot of economic uncertainty, a lot of interest rate uncertainty, and then of course, this shock to the system from banking. So, yes, it was a tough quarter for market participants, not in particular to Blue Owl, of course, but to market participants.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe one on the wealth channel and the unified branding, I guess to what extent do you think, the implementation of that unified branding is, may help over the next, year or so, and interaction with advisors that you're working with currently on those platforms. And then also, does it make it easier for you to extend in new platforms? So I mean, I guess the overall question is, to what extent do you think the unified brand can enhance fundraising over the next one to two years?\nDouglas Ostrover: Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, you raise a good and important point, and that's why we went to a unified brand. I'm especially in the wealth channel when we were out with different brands. I'm not sure if people even knew, it sat under one roof, but where we really saw it, was in the international markets. And look, our goal is to create a brand that's the equivalent of the Blackstone, the Ares, the KKR, Carlyle, TPG, around the world, and having three or four different brands, we just thought we cumbersome. And I think that ability as you think about wealth or the institutional market, the ability to cross-sell, and to understand and say that's a trusted partner. We've done well with them, when we walk-in with that new strategy, and we have instant credibility. And so, to answer your question, specifically, when we had hired a consultant about, I don't know, 18 months ago to study this for us, and we did go out to the wealth channel and all of them, all of the major wirehouses came back and said it would make their lives so much easier to have it all under one brand. So we've implemented it. We've gotten great feedback. And as I said, I think it'll be help us over time to really cross-sell all of our products.\nBrian Bedell: That's great color. Thank you. And, maybe just one last one on the direct lending. A lot of my questions have been asked and answered there, but any view on, the Basel III endgame rules that were proposed for the banking system? Is it pretty much in-line with what you what you expected. And so the strong secular trend there, of course, longer term for direct lending to become a larger source of bank lending, or do you see things in the proposed rules that make you even more excited longer term about your role in the bank lending?\nMarc Lipschultz: Look. The continued stabilization and focus on regulation of the banking sector. And look, we just went through March and we saw again, what does happen sometimes when you take very long-term commitments with very short-term capital. And again, I said this before, it's not private lenders versus the banks. It's really not. These are ecosystems that taken together solve problems. And I know some people just seem not to -- don't take it that way but it it's the case. And at the end of the day, look, we have long dated capital, from long dated investors to provide long dated solutions. And that just makes sense. We don't look, we don't have depositor. We don't present systematic risks. We don't have government explicit or implicit guarantees. And so, we can provide a different kind of risk based, different kind of duration capital. And so, look, it does appear that when you look for Basel III and kind of other recent conversations about increased capitalization of banking. Look, we don't have an opinion on that. That is to say that's a world that's adjacent to ours, wonderful banks in this country doing a wonderful job. As I said, we welcome a healthy banking market alongside, the healthy private credit market. So, we're not deep and I don't want to opine on the specifics of the regulations. But I think what we are seeing develop are adjacent systems with different kinds of capital, different kinds of risk, different kinds of providers of capital, and it works. And that's healthy. Private capital has continued its step function climb upward to providing solutions that are durable and therefore healthy for our economy in total. So, I feel good about where we're headed, and I won't call, I'll leave it to the banks to sort out the right answer for the banking sector. But I think that we can co-exist quite healthily in a way that will be good for debt markets in total.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. Great, perspective. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Doug Ostrover.\nDouglas Ostrover: Well, thanks, everyone. We appreciate everybody spending so much time and for the excellent questions. Hopefully, we gave you a good overview and hopefully, it comes through just how excited we are about the business and where we can take it. So, we look forward to talking to some of you after the call and, staying in touch. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Doug. The second quarter was characterized by many of the same themes we saw earlier in the year with uncertainty around the trajectory of interest rates and pace of economic growth constraining overall market activity. In our credit business, we continue to deploy capital into high conviction, attractive opportunities providing essential capital for our portfolio companies. Over the last 12 months, we originated nearly $15 billion of loans providing crucial financing to the M&A market. And during the second quarter, gross originations were $3.4 billion with $1.4 billion of repayments, allowing us to redeploy capital into attractive high yielding opportunities. Gross deployment has slowed a bit in keeping with lower market activity with U.S. M&A down nearly 40% on a year-on-year basis. However, as we've highlighted in prior quarters, direct lending has continued to occupy a larger share of the market. We believe much of the market share the direct lending has taken over the years reflects a permanent shift in borrower behavior, driven by the value of our lending proposition namely the benefits of privacy, predictability, and partnership. Credit quality remains very strong. Despite a more challenging macro backdrop, we continue to see good revenue and EBITDA growth on average at the portfolio companies. We have not seen any meaningful change in our internal watch list, nor have we seen any material step up in amendment requests or non-accruals. Weighted average loan-to-values remain in the low-40s across our entire direct lending portfolio and the low-30s across our tech dedicated portfolio. Across the $78 billion of loans we've originated since inception, annualized realized losses have been approximately six basis points, and those have been fully offset by realized gains over that same period. With regards to performance, the direct lending portfolio achieved gross returns of 4.3% for the second quarter and 18.9% for the last 12 months. Moving on to real estate. We continue to see high levels of interest in our net lease strategy with corporate borrowing costs elevated and financing markets more challenging. Our pipeline of opportunities remains robust, with roughly $3.8 billion of transaction volume under a letter of intent or contract close and a near-term pipeline of about $30 billion of potential volume. Inclusive of announced acquisition activity, we have invested or committed all of the equity in our fifth closed-end fund and have started deploying capital out of our sixth vintage, which we've already raised $3.7 billion of capital. We expect we'll reach our hard cap of $5 billion in the second half of this year, which would make this fund twice the size of the prior one. And during the second quarter, we added a large wirehouse distribution partner for our perpetually offered real estate product and anticipate adding to this syndicate meaningfully through the rest of this year and into 2024. With regards to performance, we achieved gross returns across our real estate portfolio of 2.3% for the second quarter and 14.2% for the last 12 months. Despite the substantial increase in interest rates, we continue to buy assets with a significant margin of safety to where they trade on a marketed basis and monetize and meaningful spreads to our entry points, notable during a period when many in the industry are facing challenges in this regard. To contextualize this, during the second quarter, we've sold or signed letters of intent on over a $150 million of assets at an average cap rate of 5.6%, achieving net IRRs of 30% and net MoICs of 1.7 times. Taking a step back, what we've been able to achieve so far with our real estate business is indicative of our playbook for future strategic M&A, and how we look to create value for our shareholders. When we acquired this business, it had about $8 billion of fee paid AUM, and a year and a half later, we've achieved 60% growth. And as I mentioned earlier, expect to raise a next vintage fund, double the size of the prior [fund] (ph). In addition, we've launched a wealth distributed product in scale raising $1.7 billion in under a year despite asset class headwinds and outflow dynamics for our pure products. Over time, we expect this will be a tremendous growth vertical for Blue Owl, and we think this has a lot to do with our decision to approach real estate a bit differently from our peers. This is the same mindset with which we approach future M&A for Blue Owl, to find parts of the market that are less crowded where we can create unique value for our investors and accelerate growth and scale by bringing businesses into our ecosystem. With that, let me turn it to Michael, to discuss GP Strategic Capital. Look, it's a good environment, Glenn, to your point about, just behind this question, it's a very good environment for what we do in triple net lease. And I say that both from a fundraising point of view because, of course, it's a very predictable, stable, safe product space, but also users of the capital in a world of corporate costs rising, uncertainty about capital availability, triple net lease looks like a -- looks like a fantastic option for many corporate users. So anyway, with regard to the Fund VI, Alex, we have $3.8 billion in the pipeline as we mentioned in our remarks. So, if that comes to fruition, now remember, we do use leverage. So, if I just rough out the math, turn of leverage for a turn of equity, then assuming we hit our $5 billion target, that's $10 billion of purchasing capacity, but $3.8 billion of signed agreements is not a small increment toward that goal, and we have $30 billion in the broader pipeline. So, I'm not -- by any means, we're getting ahead of ourselves, but we're still raising Fund VI. So, we're not here to talk about Fund VII, but we really do have a distinct proposition for the market. We're the very, very clear market leader in triple net lease for strong credit worthy and IG counterparties and demand interest in both the product and the use of the capital is growing. So, we're very excited about this, we're very excited about this channel and much like direct lending over the last year, I think we're now in the year or the period of time where there's this recognition that not all real estate is created equal, not all strategies are created equal. And, again, I think this speaks to the distinctive nature of the Blue Owl business. We really take a view of whatever we're doing, we're looking for ways to reduce risk, reduce volatility, increase predictability and basically deliver the same or better returns with lower risks and lower volatility. And triple net lease is shining through. Take a look at our returns for the last 12 months in triple net lease, our triple net lease business in a world of obvious real estate, maybe habit would overstate the case, but it's a pretty chaotic market out there. And we've delivered a 14% return in our real estate business, because of the safety and security and nature of what we do. I think the answer to that, Craig is, we continue to -- we're starting from one, right, on the real estate side. So, we certainly see that increasing significantly over the next, say six to 12 months. By year-end is a little harder to triangulate. We've got a couple new ones that we're onboarding, over the next several weeks months. So, we're going to see a significant growth on the real estate side. I almost said OCIC, to get the right new acronym, is a much more mature product that is on a lot more platforms. So, it's got quite a running head start, on our real estate REIT. But we continue to add platforms where we can opportunistically there as well. So, I certainly see a few being added over the six to 12 months. So, let me start with, look, we love the markets we're in. The U.S. market has served very well. It's by far the most robust and largest of course. And very important, I never ever want to not want to miss start any conversation about credit without credit quality. And the credit quality for both the opportunities and the way we have particularly built into this market, over $78 billion of originated credit, our running loss rate is six basis points. And in software, we have never had a loss. So, I put that first and foremost in any decision we make. And that said, do agree that Europe is much like other capital markets sort of starting to follow suit with the U.S. and that presents an opportunity. I think we will look to attack it both ways. We already do a tremendous amount of business with the firm. I mean, these are all global firms and in many cases, even European based firms. So, in our GP Stakes business, for example, we own stakes and firms all over the world, including, for example, CBC, who just raised the world's largest bio fund. So, our network, our ecosystem certainly spans well into Europe. So, organically we already do episodic opportunities there, we readily can build organically by putting more origination resources. It's the same credit work, of course, we have well over 100 people doing credit work. So organically, I think we can and will continue to sort of participate or look to accelerate our participation. But, we're open to an acquisition in the world of lending in Europe. It would be of course a jump start and with the right team and the right platform, we can do as we just talked about with the former Oak Street. Now, real estate business, I think we can do some pretty special things, when we integrate into the Blue Owl platform. So, certainly open minded about it, but otherwise or in addition, we'll pursue it organically over time. So, we've actually made multiple hires now. So, indeed, we started with, great leadership with Chris Crampton, a multi-decade veteran of the private equity industry. But we've actually, since now, three more people that have joined that team. We have more coming. We've assigned additional internal resources. We have a fully built capability to address what we think is a very, very large opportunity. So, what are we doing specifically in the secondary at all, what we're really supporting are our partner firms, that is to say all the 600 firms that we finance today are the 60 firms we own stakes in and offering them another private capital solution in this Blue Owl ecosystem. People have wonderful assets they bought. I can tell you, I personally have been in private equity since the 90s. And since that time, people have talked about, look, the thing about private equity is you buy a great business, you find out it's a great some number of years later, but then you have to sell it. Everyone wants to keep them. So, GP led secondaries, continuation is the solution to this challenge. It allows the GP to maintain ownership, and as they know well, can manage well and know as a lot of value to create liquidity as an option, but not an obligation for the LPs. So that's flexibility, crystallize returns for prior funds. So, it really is a way of meeting the needs of a lot of different stakeholders in private equity, and there's trillions of dollars of assets. So, just ask yourself this, any given firm, if you could pick one asset to keep managing and owning, compounding your -- carry an opportunity on what would it be? We're here to facilitate people keeping those assets with this strategy. And it's a very distinctive strategy. Because remember, this is what we do every day for the private equity community. We finance the GPs. We finance their portfolio companies. We're adding another solution in that trusted set of partnerships we have, we say, here bring us your trophy asset or we'll elicit from you your trophy asset, and you can continue owning it and we'll provide some liquidity for those who choose not to go forward. We think it's a very, very substantial opportunity and meets the needs of a lot of people in the market today. So, Adam, thank you. In terms of activity, I think the fundamental constraint activity has really been just absolute market levels of activity. Our share is high. Our role is distinctive. Blue Owl really plays a pretty special role in that capital solutions center. But at the end of the day, there's only so much activity. The activity has been uptick in as we just talked about. We have capacity, but I will say we and the industry, it's not excess capacity, that is to say, we've talked about this before, the dry powder and private equity very much outmatches the dry powder in private credit. And so, well, I will certainly not suggest that the slower deployment in Q2 was a lack of capacity to deploy capital, I would equally say it's not as if we have excess capacity. Fundraising will continue to be very important to having adequate firepower to support the private markets ecosystem. And, as we continue to go through these disruptions in the banking system, and disruptions in syndicated markets, I think what probably all can take away is to have a healthy economy and to have a healthy capital market system, we need a healthy private lending system. And it's -- thankfully it's very healthy today, but it can use more capital. And that's what we've been talking about and are pursuing, and by putting together GP LP, format funds by accessing the foreign markets. As Doug talked about, places we just have underpenetrated over time, we think that can help us get the capital that not just that we need to pursue our business, but frankly the market needs to have a healthy flow of capital and a healthy available leverage pool. And to your latter question about, it is the absolute cost of capital or the higher cost of capital impacting PE appetite or activity. And I don't want to pretend I know all decision makers decisions. But I would say at a meta level, no, at the end of the day, that's math, right. That gets into the clearing price of an asset. If you know what your cost of capital is and remember, one of the great strengths of direct lending is predictability. We tell you the terms, you know what it will cost. That's positive. Then you can price that into your investment decision. So, I think it speaks more to how you have to price equity transactions and that probably have led to the slowdown when you get these gaps between, what buyers want to pay and sellers want to take. But over time, markets function, and it'll just price in this cost of capital. It will probably mean less leverage to Doug's point, and that'll probably mean lower purchase prices for certain assets, but that all can be solved by change in the numbers on the, so to speak on the page. So no, I don't think cost of capital, cost of debt is likely to provide any meaningful drag. You've got $1.5 trillion of private equity dry powder. Private equity has shown its ability to thrive in high rate environments, low rate environments, strong economies, weak economies, it's good asset class, and it'll be a good asset class going forward. Thank you. The value proposition for us in direct lending is about predictability, privacy, and partnership. I mean, of course, the syndicated market matters. Of course, around the edges people are making decisions that include the fact that in the syndicated market, you might very well be able to achieve better terms, so to speak, as a borrower. But what does better mean? If you're a private equity firm making a long-term decision, I would proffer that the incremental cost of capital for private debt and incremental involvement, depth of diligence, stricter agreements, all of those things are well worth it to have the partnership and the predictability of capital. So, yes, I hope the syndicated markets will return. It's still pretty nascent. We don't see it as a meaningful factor in the marketplace today. It's not meaningful to our business today. But I hope this syndicated market returns. It's not a win-lose proposition. I'm not sure sometimes why whether, alternative asset managers on one hand or banks on the other, kind of turn toward each other and say, oh, well, if I'm winning, you're losing. I think they're about having multiple solutions in a marketplace. We need capital depth, capital depth to unlock M&A. And, we'd be glad to have this syndicated market's return and facilitate a more robust M&A environment. And frankly, there's a lot of things that syndicated market will finance. We won't. We don't finance deep cyclicals. We don't finance businesses that have extreme customer concentration. We don't -- there's a reason that we've been able to deliver six basis points of annualized loss, because we do very specific kinds of credit selection. So, we're not here to solve every capital structure, but for great firms buying great businesses who want a great capital partner, we're here to solve that. So I think it hasn't meant much yet, yes, the banks are probably open a little bit for business now. But, we hope they'll come back sooner and in fuller force. We're quite happy to compete in that arena. We deliver solution that is worth it for the people that use our capital. Sorry. What specifically about April do you mean? Oh. I understand where you're coming from. I can't answer that with any precision, our business unlike trade in markets, the rhythm is not measurable in weeks, maybe not even months, depending on the particular timeline of a transaction. So, I think it would be right for me to say, Oh, okay, well, March directly impacted April. However, there is little doubt that the hangover the malaise, the disruption of the May, I don't bank crisis, mini crisis, certainly impacted markets are included in the sense that it just kind of froze up, right, the system froze up, people froze up and anything that people were deciding on by and large probably got deferred. So I know measure could be a scientific or prescriptive is that I appreciate the nature of the question. Safe to say Q2 suffered from a lot of economic uncertainty, a lot of interest rate uncertainty, and then of course, this shock to the system from banking. So, yes, it was a tough quarter for market participants, not in particular to Blue Owl, of course, but to market participants. Thanks, Ken. Look. The continued stabilization and focus on regulation of the banking sector. And look, we just went through March and we saw again, what does happen sometimes when you take very long-term commitments with very short-term capital. And again, I said this before, it's not private lenders versus the banks. It's really not. These are ecosystems that taken together solve problems. And I know some people just seem not to -- don't take it that way but it it's the case. And at the end of the day, look, we have long dated capital, from long dated investors to provide long dated solutions. And that just makes sense. We don't look, we don't have depositor. We don't present systematic risks. We don't have government explicit or implicit guarantees. And so, we can provide a different kind of risk based, different kind of duration capital. And so, look, it does appear that when you look for Basel III and kind of other recent conversations about increased capitalization of banking. Look, we don't have an opinion on that. That is to say that's a world that's adjacent to ours, wonderful banks in this country doing a wonderful job. As I said, we welcome a healthy banking market alongside, the healthy private credit market. So, we're not deep and I don't want to opine on the specifics of the regulations. But I think what we are seeing develop are adjacent systems with different kinds of capital, different kinds of risk, different kinds of providers of capital, and it works. And that's healthy. Private capital has continued its step function climb upward to providing solutions that are durable and therefore healthy for our economy in total. So, I feel good about where we're headed, and I won't call, I'll leave it to the banks to sort out the right answer for the banking sector. But I think that we can co-exist quite healthily in a way that will be good for debt markets in total."

            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter and the last 12 months, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation. So, please feel free to have that available to follow along. To start off, we are very pleased with our second quarter an LTM results, another quarter of strong industry leading growth. Some key highlights of our results through, June 30, include total revenues up 37%, FRE up 34%, DE up 32%, and our dividend is up 33%, all on an LTM versus a year ago basis. All of this was because we built our business differently than our peers. We built our business with the foundation of permanent capital and steady predictable management fee cash flows. So to step through our results through, June 30 in more detail, management fees are up $459 million or 46% for the LTM period versus a year ago. Broken down by strategy, credit management fees are up $272 million or 53%. GP Strategic Capital management fees are up $123 million or 28%, and real estate management fees are up $64 million or 175%. Keeping in mind, we acquired our real estate business at the end of 2021, so we don't have a full year in our prior year LTM results. This is obviously very considerable growth that we've been able to accomplish. Compensation expense came in at just under 28% comp-to-revenue for the LTM period. Overall, we are trending in-line with our guidance of our comp expense ratio sitting in the 25% to 30% comp-to-revenue range, likely towards the higher-end of that range, due to further growth and investment in our business. G&A expense came in at $192 million for the LTM period and $39 million for the quarter. Overall, we are trending in-line with our guidance of G&A expense trending up a little in 2023 from last year, with placement costs down and regular way G&A higher, driven by the overall growth of our business. FRE is up $227 million or 34% for the LTM period versus a year ago. So, with our comp percentage up a little, and our overall G&A percentage down a little, we continue to be right on-track with our 60% FRE margin target for 2023. And we announced the dividend of $0.14 per share for the second quarter. For the LTM period, we have paid $0.53 in dividends versus $0.40 for a year ago. That results in a 33% increase in our dividends. Now I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts in which the environment continues to prove challenging, but we're seeing some positive indicators, I'll talk about in a moment. As you can see on slide 12, we raised $2.9 billion in the second quarter. And over the last 12 months, we raised $20.4 billion, 19% above the prior year period. I'll break down the second quarter numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised over $1.5 billion. $1.3 billion raised in our diversified and first lien lending strategies, including almost $800 million raise in our wealth distributed core income BDC, OCIC. And over $200 million raise in our tech lending strategies, almost all raised in our wealth distributed tech lending BDC OTIC. In GP Strategic Capital, we raised approximately $200 million. And in real estate, we raised approximately $1.1 billion, approximately $700 million in our real estate Fund VI and approximately $300 million in our net lease trust product ORENT, our non-traded REIT. Although we had a lower level of institutional closes in the second quarter, we continue to see strong institutional interest in our products. And in the wealth channel, we have continued to see good interest in our strategies with steady increases in our fundraising goals quarter-over-quarter, and we believe that will continue to build on itself through the end of the year. Not only are the gross fundraising levels improving, but we continue to be very encouraged by the net fundraising levels we are seeing from our products that have quarterly redemption features. As Doug pointed out, we are still seeing strong net positive inflows with these products, with gross inflows for the second quarter running at about eight times the level of outflows for the small set of products we offer a quarterly redemption feature. All in all, we've raised approximately $32 billion of fee-paying AUM since January 1, 2022, and our overall fee rate is significantly higher than our peers at over a 150 basis points versus our peer average of below a 100 basis points. As we discussed on last quarter's call, overall, as we progress through 2023, we continue to expect fundraising to tilt institutional, although as I've said previously, timing is always challenging to predict. As it relates to our AUM metrics, on slide 11, AUM grew $30.5 billion to $149.6 billion, a 26% increase from the second quarter a year ago. Fee-paying AUM grew $16.1 billion to $93.6 billion, a 21% increase from the second quarter a year ago. Both metrics are driven primarily by capital raised and deployed in credit. Capital raised in GP Stakes Fund V and capital raised in real estate Fund VI, [ONLT and ORENT] (ph). Permanent capital grew $23.1 billion to $118.6 billion, a 24% increase from the second quarter a year ago. As a reminder, 93% of our management fees are from these permanent capital vehicles. AUM not yet paying fees was $12 billion including $8.1 billion in credit, $1.1 billion in GP Strategic Capital, and $2.8 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees, totaling over $170 million once deployed which equates to a fee rate of 1.4%. In credit, we had gross originations of $3.4 billion for the quarter, and net funded deployment of $1.6 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $14.6 billion with $9.2 billion of net funded deployment. So, as it relates to the $8.1 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in credit, it would take us approximately one year to fully deploy this capital based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Deployment has obviously been running at a much slower pace, so there could be some upside to this. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on slide 17, we currently have a significant amount of liquidity with an average 13-year maturity and low 3% cost of borrowing. So, summing it all up, another strong quarter of growth for our business. As it relates to our 2023 goals that we spoke about at our Investor Day in May of 2022, we continue to track well against our goals of $1 billion of distributable earnings and $50 billion of fee paying AUM. We are currently about one quarter behind our original target timeline in achieving these 2023 goals, which we are very pleased with considering the market and fundraising environment we've all been in. And standing here today, we continue to see our path in achieving a $1 per share dividend for 2025, driven by continued strong FRE growth anticipated for the next two and a half years. We are very pleased with our results. We delivered exceptional growth in all of our key metrics. AUM, fee-paying AUM, management fees, FRE, and DE, and expect to see continued strong growth for the foreseeable future. Thank you again to everyone who's joined us on the call today. With that, operator, can we please open the line for questions? Thanks, Glenn. Appreciate the question. Good morning. When we think about our flagship real estate product, Fund VI, we are still fundraising there. We do expect to hit our goal of $4 billion, but we think we can bring that to a $5 billion close, that would double the size of Fund V. So we're super excited about that, especially in the market environment we're in, especially with the real estate sentiment, that's out there right now. GP Stakes Fund VI, we've surpassed the 75% invested. We expect to be out with investors, in the back half of this year, and we expect that we can do a closing in early next year, and maybe we can accelerate that, but let let's see how the next couple of months go. So we're excited to raise a big Fund VI there, and we think -- we certainly have the fund performance to -- that we're excited about to go out to the market with. On the credit side, we're seeing a lot of interest in the credit products as we've talked about previously. And I'm happy to hand that over to Doug, to elaborate. And I want to amplify one last thing, which Doug commented on earlier, but just touched on again, which is the nature of the capital. Again, just as we set out to build this business, we really did set out to build a very different kind of ALT's management firm. And I mean, in this context, as a shareholder in terms of the business model, so quality of assets, the fee rate on the assets, the value add, if you will, on the assets, really important. As is that duration, and remember we talked a little bit earlier for every dollar that leaves our system, we are raising $6.5. That's literally multiples of our peer set, and it relates to the fact that we have permanent capital, so you don't have the dollars flowing out, but we do have dollars flowing in. So, when you think about what those two things combined mean for the power and trajectory of this model, and the predictability of that trajectory, set aside any given quarter or quarter-to-quarter, but predict that the steepness of that slope and the predictability of its destination when you have the 1.6% fee rate and $6.5 being raised for every dollar that exits the system, it really is a different business model. I would just add, Alex that all three of our platforms have very strong growth that we've experienced since our IPO and for the foreseeable future. We expect that to continue the real estate platform. We continue to expect to have the strongest growth of the three platforms."

            "content": "Thank you, Marc. Our GP Strategic Capital business continues to serve as an important resource for the private market's ecosystem, providing growth capital to some of the largest and most diversified alternative asset managers. Most recently, we announced the minority investment in Stonepeak, a leading alternative investment firm specializing in an infrastructure and real assets with over $55 billion in AUM. With a robust and expanding pipeline, total invested commitments for our fifth GP Stakes fund including agreements and principles, have reached approximately $11 billion of capital or roughly 85% of the funds, and we currently have a line-of-sight into approximately $2 billion of new opportunities, which if all signed, would bring us through the remaining capital available in Fund V. Our focus on larger firms within the alternatives universe has positioned our platform well within the current fundraising environment. Of note, one of our managers, CBC, recently closed its latest flagship fund with 26 billion euros of commitments, surpassing its fundraising target and its private equity's largest ever buyout fund. Performance across our GP Stakes funds remained strong with a net IRR of 24% for Fund III, 49% for Fund IV, and 28% for Fund V, all of which compare favorably to the median return for private equity funds of the same vintages. Looking ahead, we are looking forward to launching conversations on our sixth vintage fund in our GP Stake strategy and continue to anticipate a first close in early 2024. Finally, I would like to address the rumors and speculation that have been in the press. I am 100% committed to Blue Owl's long-term success and will continue leading the GP Strategic Capital business. As a show of alignment for the long-term, I have elected to receive 100% of my compensation for 2023, 2024, and 2025 in Blue Owl equity. I look forward to continuing to drive value for our shareholders. With that, I will turn things over to Alan, to discuss our financial results."

            "name": "Douglas Ostrover",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of results for Blue Owl, again demonstrating the steady and resilient growth that we believe sets us apart in the alternative asset management space. When we became a public company, the thesis that we laid out for our investors was a simple one. We would generate substantial growth through a variety of market environments, anchored by our base of permanent capital, and we would provide an earnings stream that looked much less volatile than peers, with earnings supported almost entirely by management fee streams. Over the past two years, markets have shifted rapidly from a zero interest rate environment and robust capital markets to over 500 basis points Fed funds rate and meaningful declines in M&A and public issuance. The world changed overnight multiple times, and many companies face sizable challenges as a result, including supply chain difficulties, inflationary pressure, and capital funding issues. Over this period, Blue Owl was able to step up and increasingly demonstrate the value of our capital solutions to a broad slab of partners. We provided necessary capital to businesses across nearly every industry in our credit business and have seen minimal credit losses as a result of our disciplined underwriting. Our GP strategic capital platform supported the continued growth of the private markets ecosystem. And in real estate, we offered crucial and scaled alternative solutions to large companies seeking liquidity and capital flexibility. It has always been our perspective, that robust private markets support the health of both public markets and the broader economy, and we feel these past few years have been a validation of that view. Also, over this period, Blue Owl strategies provided much needed recurring income, downside protection, and inflation hedging to investors. Our credit and real estate returns have been in the double-digits on a last 12 month basis contrasted against very volatile public markets. We believe the trust that we've built with investors is reflected in the $32 billion of fee paying AUM, we've raised so far in 2022 and 2023, which compares to our fee paying AUM of $61 billion at the end of 2021 are over 50% growth. This is substantial growth in any market environment, much less the one we've faced over the past year and a half and we continue to see strong demand for our strategies. In addition, the diversification of our business between institutional and wealth channels continues to serve us well, with roughly half of our fundraising over this period, coming from each of these areas. On the institutional side, last year, we completed or made significant progress towards raises for some of our larger funds such as our GP Stakes V and our second vintage of tech lending BDC. As for 2023, we'll be more diversified between separate account mandates, new product launches, and next vintages of smaller funds. In wealth, we have returned to seeing steady increases in monthly flows for our wirehouse distributed products, and we've continued to see very modest redemption requests from the small percentage of our products, which offer a quarterly redemption feature with just over a $160 million requested in the second quarter or 0.5% of AUM in those products. This compares to over $1.3 billion raised in those same products, another very solid quarter of net inflows. If you take a step back to look at our flows across Blue Owl, from the first quarter of \u201822, to the first quarter of \u201823, we saw nearly six and a half times more inflows than we did outflows. In other words, for every dollar that left our system as a result of distributions or redemptions, we raised almost $6.50. By comparison, our peers on average raised just $2 for every dollar that left their platforms. During robust fundraising periods, this dynamic may not be as noticeable, but in a more challenging environment, such as the one we've been experiencing, you can clearly see that the assets we raise, which are higher fee, are also relatively stickier, and that is the advantage of permanent capital. So, in summary, we continue to feel very well-positioned for many different market and economic environments, as investors seek trusted scaled managers to provide safe yield and differentiated returns. We continue to see LPs growing their all alternatives allocations and consolidating their asset manager relationships, and we are confident Blue Owl will be one of the beneficiaries of this long-term secular trend. All of this is captured in the steady yet extraordinary growth that we have achieved over the past two years, increasing AUM by a 140% and distributable earnings by a 110%. Recently, we completed a full rebrand towards a unified Blue Owl name. Going forward, the legacy brands of Owl Rock, Dyal Capital and Oak Street, will be known as Blue Owl Credit, GP Strategic Capital, and Real Estate platforms. This evolution marks another milestone in Blue Owl's journey, driving towards our long standing vision of synthesizing multiple complimentary businesses into a market leading provider of Capital Solutions. And we plan to continue adding to our capabilities, further broadening the ways in which Blue Owl can be valuable to our partners and the products that we offer to our investors. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc, to give you an update on our credit and real estate businesses. Marc? Yes. Thanks for the question. So look, when you mentioned the word cyclical, we don't really view it as cyclical. It's really just more fundraising, it's episodic. And when we talk about being a quarter behind, it's really I got to get the exact number, but it's just a few billion dollars of fundraising have a big impact on that delta. But maybe I can just address it, in a little more detail. Look, the pipeline looks really strong, and as I said, it's hard to predict timing, but we are seeing a lot of enthusiasm for the strategies. So, let me just start maybe with private wealth and then I'll roll in to institutional as well. Remember, the funds, they generate a lot of income. They're downside protected. It's definitely resonated. If you look on the wealth side for continuously offered credit products, I think we were up 32% quarter-over-quarter. Now one quarter certainly doesn't make a trend, but we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in our wealth credit strategies and we're expanding the syndicates. Real estate across the industry, I think, because there have been redemptions in funds, lots of chatter about office, real estate quotes have definitely been slower, but we're starting to see some real excitement about our triple net lease strategy, and we're going to have some meaningful growth to our syndicate this quarter. So, I'm really excited, as you know, about what we can do with this product. We're seeing it on the institutional side, and I think now on the wealth side, we're going to be able to grow. Most importantly, we've had minimal redemptions across all of our products. So, in wealth, we're very, very excited about this channel. Again, it's just one quarter, but I'm cautiously optimistic. On the institutional side, we're still seeing a tremendous amount of interest in our credit strategies. But you have to remember, this is a bit of a strange quarter for us. We're not in the market with any flagship funds. And as you know, we just finished raising $8 billion of fee-paying assets at very high fees for our Tech II product. And so, the way I would think about is we will be in the market with new credit products over the next few quarters. We've already gone out, talked to investors. We're seeing a lot of interest. If I think about this quarter and last quarter, the best way to think about what we've been doing is we're really dealing with more bespoke mandates, really more SMAs. And it's really hard to predict the timing on those. And by the way, these SMA's are large, but it's not like we have fund and we can say the timing is we're closing August 31, you have to be in. These are much more negotiated. And I think between now and the end of the year, you'll start to see some of those hit. And as Alan mentioned, we'll finish up fundraising in real estate VI. We're in the market with our continuation fund and we expect to be in the market with GP Stakes, Fund VI as well. Since I have the mic, I can't help myself. Just one last thing. I know everyone is very fixated on asset growth, but we'd like to start changing the conversation a little bit to the type of assets we're raising and why we're different. Our average fee today is about 1.6%, our average management fee. When I look across our peers, many are at 1%, but many are well below 1%. So, not every dollar raised is the same. And in addition, our capital doesn't leave, as Alan touched on. So, we're really excited. We think the trajectory and the destination are still really strong. And, I have more to say on fundraising in the upcoming quarters as we launch some of these new credit funds. Yes. Listen, As I think about the credit business, in particular, remember in the past, we've done, which has been a good strategy, a lot of BDCs, and now we're transitioning into some more longer duration GP LP strategies. And so, the most obvious, we will be in the market with a diversified strategy really geared towards the international markets. Not going into too much detail, coming up with a structure that really works well. And then, I'm happy, we're not ready to disclose it, but just like in Tech, I think today, we are about $16 billion, $17 billion dedicated software capital. I think you're going to see us launch, other industry verticals that we think could be quite large. So, combination of moving, we're going to do other BDCs, but also introduce more GP LP funds where we can be in the market on a more regular basis. If you think about our peers, they do Fund I, the money leaves, they come back with Fund II. Our BDC is the capital doesn't leave, but there's not always the opportunity to come back with the subsequent funds. So, we'll start to build more of that GP LP sequence and more industry focused funds. So, let me start with the syndicate. I think we are planning to launch on two very large wires. As you know, we've been primarily in one wire, where we've had really meaningful market share there, and we are about to launch on two new wires. I think we've raised about $2 billion, just under $2 billion to-date. Look, I think this is a really exciting product. It's tax advantage. It generates high current income. I think you heard in our comments, even in this rising rate environment, we've been able to sell assets and generate meaningful capital gains. So, I'm really optimistic about where we can take this product on the wealth channel. And, over the next couple of weeks, hopefully, we'll announce who the two big wires are, but we're basically done there. And then, on the institutional side, I'll let Marc comment on where we are in terms of deployment and when we can be back in market. Good morning, and thanks for the question. I think you're right. It is a massive opportunity for us. I actually spoke to the firm last night about this. We are really starting to see some significant penetration throughout Asia and the Middle East. And, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but as we, for example, as we round out Fund VI in real estate, I think the bulk of that will come from overseas investors and certainly, it's a big area of focus for us. We've spent a bunch of money building out the team throughout Asia, specifically in Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore. And so to answer your question, I think we will -- as I've always said, I think we will get more than our fair share from those markets. Yes. I think the best way to think about it, and I'm sorry I can't give you a number because I'm trying to run through it in my head. But I think we're going be able, and I don't want to put -- I don't want to say it'll definitely happen within six months. But I think, basically, we will be on virtually every major platform in the market with one of our products, which is really significant. And so there have been a few firms that have been somewhat elusive, and we haven't been able to get on. And now they've agreed to put one of our products on. So, I look, we view ourselves as a clear number two player in this marketplace. And I'm, as I said in my comments and early on, we've always been excited about it, and our penetration continues to grow, and we remain, very optimistic about what we can do. Thanks, Craig. Yes. Deployment certainly is part of it. And, we certainly can't defy the M&A cycle as I commented, but direct lending share and our share in particular continues to be really strong. We like where it positions us as the M&A cycle takes the other turn, and it does seem to be firming mean, there's a little doubt our activity and activity in large opportunities has been accelerated. So, it hard to predict that to any given month or quarter, but the movement is the correct direction. Yes, I think you saw out this morning the buyout of New Relic and Blue Owl was leading that financing. Again, our leadership in the world of software, I think continues to shine through. These are great opportunities for us, significant -- and, again, sort of significant signs of life, again, would probably overstate because frankly wasn't that it was more abundant before in these markets, but it's picking up. So, yes, I think another one of the reasons to sort of feel good as we turn into the back half. But again, well, we restate that so as not to get trapped into an excessively quarterly cycle. But, as we turn into the sort of next six and 12 months, yes, it does seem like activity is picking up nicely. And I think there's an awful lot of pent-up demand for PE deployment. And we're in a great position to garner a very large share of that. Thanks Patrick. Yes. And if you think about how our business our entire model is really set up to be a solutions provider. We have 650 PE firms we cover. On the credit side, we have stakes and over 60 private markets firms. And we're not in the PE business. We're not a competitor. And so, we've gone out and they've said to us, our most pressing need, as Marc was saying, is how do we hold on to our best assets longer? And we think we are we can come in and provide that capital. And I have to tell you, when we look at the market, when we look at the demand from these PE firms to hold on to these assets, the demand for capital is enormous. The supply of capital is de-minimis. And whenever you're in an environment, where the demand is so much greater than the supply of capital, we think we can generate outsized returns for our investors. In terms of fundraising, we are dual tracking it. We're in the institutional market. We're also in the wealth channel. Let's just focus on wealth for a minute. Think about the average investor trying to access the PE market. Maybe they can find one firm, two firms. Usually, it'll be one of the big brands. But we're going to give them a way to come in. We'll go out we're going to say these are the top 150 firms, and we're going to focus on the deal flow from those 150 firms. They'd never be able to get that kind of access. And so, we think we're going to create a better way, especially for the wealthy investor to invest in PE. And, it's early days and, it's not going to have a huge impact on \u201823 numbers, but as Marc alluded to, the [TAM] (ph) here is very, very large. And I think if we come in and we execute and we think we can generate top quartile result, totally better. I think we can create something potentially that's going to be quite large. Thank you. Yes, Marc talked about the demand from PE versus supply of capital. And I think one thing that is not discussed a lot is, the big players like ourselves who were sitting with these large capital bases, when rates were lower and M&A was robust, we could have 20%, 25% of our loans get refinanced in a quarter. So, we had so much money to deploy because you take what's refinance plus what's coming in. Today, there's very little being refinanced. There's very little M&A. And so, what we have to put to work is really just new capital coming in. So, it's a very good time. And look, the positive for us, our returns are basically on an unlevered basis, have gone from 6%, 7% to about 12%. So clearly, PE firms have to use less leverage, because the interest burden is that much greater. But look, as Marc said, its deployment is really driven by M&A volumes right now. And it feels like it's picking up, but it's too early to tell. Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, you raise a good and important point, and that's why we went to a unified brand. I'm especially in the wealth channel when we were out with different brands. I'm not sure if people even knew, it sat under one roof, but where we really saw it, was in the international markets. And look, our goal is to create a brand that's the equivalent of the Blackstone, the Ares, the KKR, Carlyle, TPG, around the world, and having three or four different brands, we just thought we cumbersome. And I think that ability as you think about wealth or the institutional market, the ability to cross-sell, and to understand and say that's a trusted partner. We've done well with them, when we walk-in with that new strategy, and we have instant credibility. And so, to answer your question, specifically, when we had hired a consultant about, I don't know, 18 months ago to study this for us, and we did go out to the wealth channel and all of them, all of the major wirehouses came back and said it would make their lives so much easier to have it all under one brand. So we've implemented it. We've gotten great feedback. And as I said, I think it'll be help us over time to really cross-sell all of our products. Well, thanks, everyone. We appreciate everybody spending so much time and for the excellent questions. Hopefully, we gave you a good overview and hopefully, it comes through just how excited we are about the business and where we can take it. So, we look forward to talking to some of you after the call and, staying in touch. Thanks."

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we advise that to all parties that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to Ann Dai, Head of Investor Relations for Blue Owl.\nAnn Dai: Thanks, operator, and good morning to everyone. Joining me today are Doug Ostrover, our Chief Executive Officer; Marc Lipschultz and Michael Rees, our Co-Presidents; and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company's control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in Blue Owl Capital's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We'd also like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, available on the Investor Resources section of our website at blueowl.com. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase, and interest in any Blue Owl fund. This morning, we issued our financial results for the first quarter of 2023, reporting fee-related earnings or FRE of $0.16 per share and distributable earnings or DE of $0.15 per share. We declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the first quarter, payable on May 31st, to holders of record as of May 19. During the call today, we'll be referring to the earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning. So, please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug.\nDouglas Ostrover: Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of results for Blue Owl, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business model in the midst of volatile market conditions. Over the past year, a year marked by substantial interest-rate hikes, persistently high inflation, and considerable swings in the public markets, we have achieved over 40% growth on the key metrics we use to evaluate our business, including management fees, FRE, and DE, all while maintaining an industry-leading 60% FRE margin. And we feel like we're just getting started. The past couple of months have demonstrated the value of having durable permanent capital, which means we are never a forced seller in precarious markets and which allows us to deploy incremental capital into some of the most attractive opportunities we've seen in some time. We believe our focus on downside protected, income-generating strategies, resonates more than ever against the backdrop of a more unpredictable near-term environment. And we are hearing the sentiment echoed in our conversations with existing and prospective investors. Since January 1, 2022, we have raised approximately $29 billion of fee-paying capital across equity and debt, which compares to our fee-paying AUM of $61 billion at the end of 2021, almost 50% growth. All three of our verticals have contributed to this growth and we have seen roughly equal inflows from our institutional and private wealth clients. This is a very strong organic growth on an absolute basis. And when you consider the more difficult fundraising environment that we've been in for the last year, we're incredibly proud of what we've accomplished thus far. Importantly, we also continue to see a very modest redemption class from the small percentage of our products which offer a quarterly redemption feature with just $248 million requested in the first quarter or less than 1% of AUM in those products during a period marked by heightened market volatility and investor uncertainty. This compares to over $1 billion raised in those same products. So, we remain solidly in net inflows status. From a deployment perspective, a more tumultuous market can result in temporary slowdowns and transaction volumes as buyers, sellers, and intermediaries pause to take stock of the market landscape, as we've seen on numerous occasions over the past year. We think these are exactly the types of markets that further accelerate the value proposition for and the adoption of the solutions that we offer across direct lending, GP Solutions, and triple-net lease real estate. We saw this play out during COVID and we're seeing it now. While sponsors have been deploying capital at a slower pace in recent quarters, they have turned to the direct lending market in greater fashion for the deals they are announcing. Our GP solutions business has continued to offer valuable capital to the growing upper-middle market GP community and with our $13 billion Fund V fully raised and already 70% committed, we will be looking ahead to Fund VI in short order. And for our real-estate business, the current interest-rate environment has made it even more attractive for companies to consider a net lease solution for their capital needs. We are pleased with the $1.5 billion we raised in real estate in the first quarter and the over $4 billion raised in the last six months, particularly given the market environment. So, what you're hearing from us is that our playbook remains unchanged despite the many things changing around us. We're focused on raising long-duration and mostly permanent capital from institutional and private wealth clients, both of whom continue to grow their allocations to alternatives. We are putting that capital to work with the same selectivity and rigorous underwriting standards, we've always utilized and we continue to innovate through new product development, while carefully evaluating the many inorganic opportunities that present themselves. We're very pleased with the growth that we've been able to deliver for shareholders thus far. Blue Owl's significant permanent capital base is a foundational and intentional differentiator for us, creating a stable base off of which to grow. And our management fee-centric earnings position us well to deliver steady progress against various market backdrops without the substantial volatility that our peers have from carried interest. Our growth has been outsized relative to peers, other financial companies, and broader market industries, and with our newly fixed annual dividend of $0.56 per share for 2023, we are offering an attractive dividend yield of roughly 5% and expect to continue to grow that dividend meaningfully in the coming years. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc to give you an update on our direct lending and real estate business. Marc?\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thanks, Doug. During the first quarter, the market trends that we observed in the last few quarters continued and accelerated. Capital scarcity seemed to reach new heights and Blue Owl continued to act as an integral liquidity provider to sponsors and companies. Over the last 12 months, Blue Owl's direct lending business has originated nearly $19 billion of loans providing crucial financing to the M&A market. We continue to see sizable deals come to the direct lending market, a reflection of the pause seen in liquid credit markets and an acknowledgment of the value of private credit solutions during more uncertain times. As we've highlighted in the past quarters, this remains an excellent environment in which to deploy capital at wider spreads and lower loan-to-values than a year ago, financing large and very-high quality companies. And the loans we are making are backed by sticky stable permanent capital. As expected, broader market M&A volumes remained slow in the first quarter of 2023, and while our deployment activity is certainly not immune to that trend, we continue to see direct lenders capture significant market share. Credit quality remains strong, despite a more challenging backdrop, we continue to see good revenue and EBITDA growth year-over-year on average in the portfolio. Weighted-average loan to values remain in the low 40s across our direct lending portfolio and in the low-30s across our tech portfolio. Across the $75 billion of loans, we've originated since inception, annualized realized losses have been approximately 6 basis points and those have been fully offset by realized gains over that period. And with regards to performance, the direct lending portfolio achieved a gross appreciation of 4.6% for the first quarter and 13.2% for the last 12 months. Now moving on to real estate, we continue to see high levels of interest in our net lease strategy with corporate borrowing costs elevated and financing markets stall. Our pipeline of opportunities remains robust with roughly $3.3 billion of transaction volume under a letter of intent or contract to close and a near-term pipeline of about $30.8 billion of potential volume. Inclusive of announced acquisition activity, we have invested or committed nearly all of the equity in our fifth closed-end fund and have started deploying capital out of our sixth vintage. The stability and quality of the income generated by our triple-net lease strategy continues to resonate strongly with investors. Inflation concerns are minimized as all property expenses are borne by the tenant while growth concerns are mitigated by contractual rent escalators over a very long 10-year-plus duration lease terms. Our tenants are primarily large brand-name firms with investment-grade credit profiles as a real estate that we own in this strategy is generally in logistics properties or what we call mission-critical retail, the physical footprint for these businesses need to conduct their everyday operations. While we understand there is more investor caution around real estate as an asset class these days, we think our real estate business sits exactly where you'd want to be positioned for this environment. Downside protected through income generation, purchase price, contractual lease duration, and the credit quality of our tenants and the triple-net lease structure. With regards to performance, we achieved gross appreciation across our real-estate portfolio of 4.4% for the first quarter and 19.1% for the last 12 months. In our view great risk-adjusted returns for the strong underlying credit profile of these portfolios. Referencing back to my opening comments today, we continue to see a very constructive environment for our direct lending and real estate business. With attractive opportunities to put capital to work and a strong interest in the strategies that we offer. The market shocks of the past couple of quarters have reminded people that when markets shift? They can shift very rapidly -- being senior in the capital structure, generating meaningful returns through income and having your investments supported by permanent and long-duration capital are all very good things for our investors and very good things for Blue Owl. With that, let me turn it to Michael to discuss GP Capital Solutions.\nMichael Rees: Thank you, Marc. Our GP Capital Solutions business was active in the first quarter of 2023, moving dialogue forward on potential investments and working with many partner managers as they continue to expand and diversify their businesses. Despite what has broadly been characterized as a more challenging fundraising environment, our focus on the largest firms within the alternatives universe has positioned our platform well to capture the ongoing secular tailwinds towards alternatives. We continue to see the market share of the largest managers expand and this phenomenon seems to accelerate during times of market volatility. In the past couple of years, mega funds of $1 billion or more in the private capital industry have accounted for 65% of the capital raised. Looking at 2022, this concentration is more like 70% to 75%, a clear indicator of the value of having scale and a strong brand. We think our partner managers have certainly benefited from this dynamic with most achieving or exceeding their fundraising targets, despite greater near-term headwinds. Total invested commitments for Dyal V including agreements and principles remain around $9 billion of capital committed or roughly 70% of the funds. The forward pipeline is robust and we continue to evaluate numerous opportunities that are quite attractive. Performance across Dyal Funds remained strong with a net IRR of 23.1% for Fund III, 50.2% for Fund IV, and 31.9% for Fund V, all of which compare favorably to the median returns for private-equity funds of the same vintages. We held a close for our professional sports minority investment strategy during the first quarter, bringing commitments for that strategy to over $500 million. Looking ahead, we're excited about what the next year holds for the GP Capital Solutions business, we continue to expand the breadth of our potential investor base institutionally and in the wealth channel, and still anticipate launching conversations for Fund VI later this year. With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter and the last 12 months, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation, so please feel free to have that available to follow along. To start off, we are pleased to report that since we've been a public company for two years, this is the first quarter, we can report LTM comparisons, which are reflected in our earnings presentation. As you know, we report quarterly, but we really run our business with a two to five-year view in LTM info and not just quarterly results provides a more fulsome picture of the progress we've made across our business. So, some key highlights of our results through March 31 include total revenues up 44%, FRE up 40%, DE up 41%, and our dividend is up 35%, all on an LTM basis versus a year ago. So, in the midst of this market turbulence, we continue to post solid results, which supports what we have been saying for the past two years. We built our business with a foundation of permanent capital and steady predictable management fee cash flows. We don't have lumpy volatile carried interest revenues flowing through our P&L. So, our business model and growth profile look different than our peers. And this will continue to differentiate us in the diversified alt industry. To put some numbers to this, for the past two years, our peers had on average 30% to 35% of the total asset management revenues, come from lumpy volatile carried interest cash flows. Again just very different models than us. Okay, let's step to our results through March 31, in more detail, management fees are up $483 million or 55% for the LTM period versus a year ago broken down by strategy, direct lending management fees are up $242 million or 51, GP Capital Solutions management fees were up $169 million or 44, and real-estate management fees are up $72 million or over 400%. But keep in mind, we acquired our real estate business at the end of 2021, this is obviously very considerable growth that we've been able to accomplish. Compensation expense came in, in line with our expectations at approximately 27% comp to revenue. G&A expense came in also in line with our expectations at $48 million for the quarter. Placement costs were a little elevated due to a large closing in our ORTF II BDC. Overall, we are trending in line with our expectations and guidance of G&A expense trending up a little in 2023 from last year. FRE is up $246 million or 40% for the LTM period versus a year ago and we continue to be right on track with our 60% FRE margin guidance for 2023. And we announced a dividend of $0.14 per share for the first quarter. For the LTM period, we have paid $0.50 in dividends versus $0.37 for a year-ago period. That results in a 35% increase in our dividend for the LTM period. Now I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts. We were pleased with our results for the quarter, in particular, considering the very challenging fundraising environment we're in. As a reminder, as you can see on Slide 12, in the first quarter of 2022, we raised $3.9 billion and now in the first quarter of 2023, we raised $3.8 billion. And on an LTM comparative basis, we raised $24.7 billion through March 31 versus $11.3 billion for the prior year, an increase of approximately 120%. And one of the toughest fundraising environment that we've seen in some time, we more than doubled our fundraise levels. I'll break down the 1Q '23 numbers across our strategies and products. In direct lending, we raised $1.9 billion, $1.2 billion raised in our diversified lending strategy, including almost $600 million raised in our retail distributed core income BDC ORCIC. And over $700 million raised in our tech lending strategies, including almost $200 million raised in our retail distributed tech lending BDC ORCIC. In GP Capital Solutions, we raised over $300 million. And in real estate, we raised over $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion in our real estate Fund VI, which we remain on track with our Investor Day goals of raising $5 billion for this product, and $300 million for our net lease trust product, our new non-traded REIT. We continue to see strong institutional interest in our products and the wealth channel rebounded in March from our lows in February. Although we expect in certain areas, continued pressure on the wealth channel. As we discussed on last quarter's call, as we progress through 2023, we continue to expect fundraising to tilt institutional although timing is always challenging to predict. In particular, in times of market disruption and dislocation. Turning to some of our wealth products, we continue to be very encouraged by the net fundraising levels we continue to see from our products that have quarterly redemption features. As Doug pointed out, we are still seeing strong net positive inflows with these products with gross inflows running at about 5 times the level of redemptions. All in all, we've raised approximately $29 billion of fee-paying AUM since Jan 1, 2022. As it relates to our AUM metrics, on Slide 11, AUM grew $42.4 billion to $144.4 billion, a 42% increase from the first quarter a year ago. Fee-paying AUM grew $26 billion to $91.6 billion, a 40% increase from the first quarter a year ago. Both metrics-driven primarily by capital raised and deployment in direct lending, capital raised in GP Capital Solutions Fund V, capital raised in real estate Fund VI, in LP and NLT, and the addition of our CLO business. Permanent capital grew $28.7 billion to a $114.3 billion, a 34% increase from the first quarter a year ago. As a reminder, 93% of our management fees are from these permanent capital vehicles. AUM not yet paying fees was $11.7 billion including $7.6 billion in-direct lending, $1.2 billion in GP Capital Solutions, and $2.9 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling over $155 million once deployed, which equates to a fee rate of over 1.3%, which speaks to the quality of the capital raised. In direct lending, we had gross originations of $1.6 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $1.3 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months, to $18.8 billion with $12.2 billion of net funded deployment. So, as it relates to the $7.6 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us a little over two quarters to fully deploy this based on our average net-funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Although our current deployment pace is a little slower than that. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on Slide 17, we currently have a significant amount of liquidity with an average 13-year maturity and low 2.9%, cost of borrowing. So, summing it all up, another great quarter, although it is a challenging fundraising environment, we continue to make good progress and grow at industry-leading levels. We have always talked about the importance of our permanent capital in our business model and this is exactly why. Our fee-paying AUM grows more meaningfully versus our peers. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, this is all a testament to our business model of strong predictable high-margin growth. We are very pleased with our results, we delivered strong growth in all of our key metrics. AUM, fee-paying AUM, management fees, FRE and DE with each of these metrics up 40% or more year-over-year. Thank you again to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that, operator, will we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hope you're all doing well. I wanted to dig a little deeper into Alan's comments on the institutional channel effort, which institutional funds are you currently marketing in the credit business? And can you comment on if the fee levels are really any different than your retail offering as we think about mix?\nDouglas Ostrover: Hey, Craig. It's Doug. Let me make a couple of comments on fundraising in general, and then I'll get into the funds in the market. So, first of all, you've heard from a lot of people, it's definitely a difficult fundraising environment, but from what we're seeing, the secular tailwinds for all, it really hasn't changed. And I think you'd agree with this when there\u2019s, market volatility when we're having bank failures, it certainly makes fundraising more difficult. Our products and I'll get into those in a moment, have high-current income inflation protection and obviously downside protection. And when, I look at what we've done through \u201822 and the first-quarter of \u201823. Alan referenced as we've grown our assets by 40%. And this will start to get to your question. Not only have we grown assets, but these are assets that have really attractive fees and very attractive margins. It's not insurance money, it's not CLOs, it's not 10 to 30 basis-point money, this is a good fees and good carry. So look, as we sit here today, obviously the spectrum of outcomes, a little wider, and I'd say, for me, it's a little incrementally, it's a little more difficult to predict the timing of fundraising. But we are seeing significant demand for all of our strategies. We've invested heavily in distribution globally and we're continuing to invest the funds. Have a great track-record, and so can tell you the exact timing, but we still feel really good about our ability to generate meaningful growth. The big fund-raise we have in the market right now is on Oak Street VI, we've raised just under $3 billion. We have a hard cap with 5. We feel really good about hitting that cap. We're still in the market with our Tech BDC Tech II. I think we just surpassed $4 billion, Alan, and we'll wrap that up. And, I think that's kind of in-line with expectations and we're excited and I think will generate great returns with that capital. And then we have a number of sub-strategies which I can go through with you in the credit space. And of course there some SMAs as well. And then, I do have to admit away from institutional. We have three things in the market and private wealth and. While flows have slowed we're still doing pretty well in that space as well.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from autonomous Research Davitt. Your line is open. You there. Might be.\nPatrick Davitt: I am sorry. I mean, yes, thanks. Right. Yes part, do you hear me. So I'm sorry if I missed this. But,, I think you're sticking. I heard you're sticking with the 60% margin, but you still expect you can do $25 billion of gross fundraise and $1 billion of FRE this year or are you kind of pulling off that a bit.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Patrick, good morning. It's Alan. We still feel-good about being in and around our targets, but let me let me add a couple of thoughts to that. Since we posted these targets. A year-ago, the world has changed quite a bit, right. This has been one of the most challenging fundraising environment we've seen in a very long time. Yet our fundraise is up a 120% year-over-year. So we're still really confident in our outsized growth trajectory. Our retail flows have held up extremely well despite the environment and we're really pleased with our results, 40% plus year-over-year growth in every key metric of our business. There is a lot of hypotheticals, that we could kick around. And yes, there is more volatility. And yes, the range of outcomes is wider as Doug just mentioned. Then what than before. But we feel-good about being in and around our targets.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Katz. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi. This is Cameron Phillips (ph) on for Bill Katz. I just wanted to get further color on the net lease pipeline just how it's been growing quarter-over quarter Year-over-Year as well as what you see in a typical pacing of getting that pipeline completed. Given the macro-environment. Thank you.\nDouglas Ostrover: Sure. Look it's a very, very good it's a good environment to be a private capital solutions provider a bit large and in a triple-net lease. I think that dynamic is very-very visible for us. We see it in terms of the number of companies that are engaged, interested, the number of properties, the terms on which we can buy it. I think by any measure, this is a really appealing time to be offering in alternative solution when you don't have. The kind of traditional functioning markets even less. So we do very well and we've done very well for 12 years with highly functional markets around when the markets are not functional that much better. So the pipeline is very strong and it gets down to one simple observation that comes out of all that, which is the end-of-the day, what we are offering with triple net lease is a type of credit. It's a type of financing solution. But it's even better because you also own a strategic physical asset underneath it, but with a 15, 20-year lease with all the expenses paid by the tenants. So, point of view the investor inflation is mitigated. So it's really a wonderful way to make an extremely low-vol predictable long-term return. But for the user of the capital for the company to get right to your question if you don't have simple functioning markets whether that's a bank market, bond market, or otherwise then it's quite more appealing to say, well, listen, I do have this warehouse side, do have this build and, we operate out of, I have this manufacturing facility, why do I need to be in the -- own the real estate business. I should be able to make a much higher return in my core business. And so, they turned to us and we're by far the leader in this space as you know. So, we're seeing the benefits of that and not surprisingly, let's comment on more attractive terms today than it did a year ago. The cap rates that we can buy out or even better. So, yes, it's a very appealing environment for us. I'd say also from the point of view, the investors, we have a strategy that is so distinctive from any other real estate strategy out there, right? We don't own releasing risk, we don't own the uncertainties of the commercial market, we don't run highly levered strategies. So, it's a good -- it's a good time for this business.\nOperator: Perfect. All right. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington. Your line is opening.\nAlexander Bernstein: Hi. This is Alex Bernstein stepping in for Ken Worthington. Thanks so much for taking my question. We wanted to double-click on the banking crisis that's been holding in the US. Do you see a longer-term opportunity for the alternative credit business to supply lending capacity here? And do you see an opportunity for OWL, and what would that look like? And maybe as a second part of that question, if you do see such an opportunity, is there any incremental investment or build-out that you think that be required to take advantage of it? Or do you already have everything more or less in place? Thank you.\nDouglas Ostrover: Sure. Look, just this ongoing -- whatever term, what we are applied to it -- to apply to it but this banking transition, I don't know if it's a crisis or not, but it certainly a meaningful shift in the market. So, let me headline with, yes, it presents opportunities for Blue Owl. It presents opportunities for direct lending and private capital solutions in general. So, I'd say that with the clear observation, it's not like any of us like to see these things happen, nobody likes to see and I -- none of us do want to see banks that are having kind of evaporate, these are great businesses that have been built over time. And it's not helpful to the markets in aggregate when you have this kind of capital disruption. But for purposes also that will be clear on this call. Yes, it's a positive for us. I mean, the reality is, and I'll say this at least qualitatively, we know that when you take a lot of capital out of the system and in fact, the regional banks, where some of the only banks left, that's still actually lend money to companies. Right? That is to say, the large money center banks have long ago migrated really out of the balance sheet business into the securities business, into the -- they're moving as opposed to storage business. The regional banks actually would still show up and provide capital and while we did frequently overlap in the same companies given that scale, very large scale that we participate in, there certainly was some presence. So, qualitatively, it's very clear, this is going to mean more demand or I should say, the same demand for capital and fewer suppliers of it. The suppliers that remain, the regional banks that stay in place, it's also apparent that they're going to have a higher cost of capital. And so, all of that means more opportunity, the quantitative effects, too early to quantify is definitively a positive number as to how positive, I guess it also depends just how much -- how many more of these ripples there aren't in the system, but it has been -- it's been disrupt dividends. I think also amplified for people, the power of our model, which is having permanent capital, long-dated capital to meet long-dated needs, works, it's good for the economy, it's good for the capital markets, private markets through all these times it picture the weekend of SVB. And we were talking about how do we provide capital to make sure that we had capital available, ready to go and that's been true last weekend with First Republic, we at the end of the day, are here is a study provider. So, I think the direct lending business has proven to be really a stabilizing force for the market get (ph) launch. So, it's capital -- it's opportunity coming our way, I think it is allowing our marketplace to continue to provide something important for the economy. And in terms of what that might I'll translate into, we've got the infrastructure. So, to answer your question specifically, no, we don't need to build infrastructure, this is what we do. We've looked at and I think about 8,000 different loans to make the hundreds that we have. So, we're fully built. So, this is more opportunity, again we don't say it gleefully, we don't want to get it this way, but yes, we are a beneficiary.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt. Patrick? Patrick, are you there?\nPatrick Davitt: Sorry, guys. Hard to [Technical Difficulty] with me today. Thanks. So, on the retail products is the triple-net lease still on only one distributor. If so, could you update us on the timeline for more coming online? And secondly, are there still a lot of big platforms coming online with ORCIC and ORTIC this year? Thank you.\nDouglas Ostrover: Yeah. So, let me start on net lease trust. We are on one platform, we've had a lot of success. We thought we'd be on a few more by this time. By -- it's just taking a little bit longer given everything that's going on in the markets. I think by -- in the next six months, we should be on another three to four wirehouses. So, I'm -- I feel pretty good that hopefully we can triple, quadruple the amount of monthly, quarterly fundraising in that product. There's definitely a lot of interest, it's just taking a bit longer. And the other products we are we continue to add wirehouses. I think those platforms -- those syndicates are largely built for us. And I would predict that net lease trust by the end of the year will be our single largest syndicate.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. And I do not see any further questions at this time. So, I'll turn it back over to the Blue Owl team.\nDouglas Ostrover: Well, thank you, everyone, I'm -- we are really proud of our results this quarter, especially in light of what's been going on in the markets and we're grateful for the support and partnership. I have to add, though, on a personal note, I don't understand how our stock is trading at $10.60. You've heard from the team, our income streams are very predictable, our margins are consistent, we've got permanent capital and I would say that our revenue is probably the most predictable of any alternative asset manager. Most importantly, our dividend yield is now 5% and we've signaled that our dividend will be materially higher next year and the year after. So, it feels like to me and the team that this is going to be a very good entry point for investors. Again, I want to thank everyone for the time and look forward to following up in the days ahead. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great day.",

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Doug. During the first quarter, the market trends that we observed in the last few quarters continued and accelerated. Capital scarcity seemed to reach new heights and Blue Owl continued to act as an integral liquidity provider to sponsors and companies. Over the last 12 months, Blue Owl's direct lending business has originated nearly $19 billion of loans providing crucial financing to the M&A market. We continue to see sizable deals come to the direct lending market, a reflection of the pause seen in liquid credit markets and an acknowledgment of the value of private credit solutions during more uncertain times. As we've highlighted in the past quarters, this remains an excellent environment in which to deploy capital at wider spreads and lower loan-to-values than a year ago, financing large and very-high quality companies. And the loans we are making are backed by sticky stable permanent capital. As expected, broader market M&A volumes remained slow in the first quarter of 2023, and while our deployment activity is certainly not immune to that trend, we continue to see direct lenders capture significant market share. Credit quality remains strong, despite a more challenging backdrop, we continue to see good revenue and EBITDA growth year-over-year on average in the portfolio. Weighted-average loan to values remain in the low 40s across our direct lending portfolio and in the low-30s across our tech portfolio. Across the $75 billion of loans, we've originated since inception, annualized realized losses have been approximately 6 basis points and those have been fully offset by realized gains over that period. And with regards to performance, the direct lending portfolio achieved a gross appreciation of 4.6% for the first quarter and 13.2% for the last 12 months. Now moving on to real estate, we continue to see high levels of interest in our net lease strategy with corporate borrowing costs elevated and financing markets stall. Our pipeline of opportunities remains robust with roughly $3.3 billion of transaction volume under a letter of intent or contract to close and a near-term pipeline of about $30.8 billion of potential volume. Inclusive of announced acquisition activity, we have invested or committed nearly all of the equity in our fifth closed-end fund and have started deploying capital out of our sixth vintage. The stability and quality of the income generated by our triple-net lease strategy continues to resonate strongly with investors. Inflation concerns are minimized as all property expenses are borne by the tenant while growth concerns are mitigated by contractual rent escalators over a very long 10-year-plus duration lease terms. Our tenants are primarily large brand-name firms with investment-grade credit profiles as a real estate that we own in this strategy is generally in logistics properties or what we call mission-critical retail, the physical footprint for these businesses need to conduct their everyday operations. While we understand there is more investor caution around real estate as an asset class these days, we think our real estate business sits exactly where you'd want to be positioned for this environment. Downside protected through income generation, purchase price, contractual lease duration, and the credit quality of our tenants and the triple-net lease structure. With regards to performance, we achieved gross appreciation across our real-estate portfolio of 4.4% for the first quarter and 19.1% for the last 12 months. In our view great risk-adjusted returns for the strong underlying credit profile of these portfolios. Referencing back to my opening comments today, we continue to see a very constructive environment for our direct lending and real estate business. With attractive opportunities to put capital to work and a strong interest in the strategies that we offer. The market shocks of the past couple of quarters have reminded people that when markets shift? They can shift very rapidly -- being senior in the capital structure, generating meaningful returns through income and having your investments supported by permanent and long-duration capital are all very good things for our investors and very good things for Blue Owl. With that, let me turn it to Michael to discuss GP Capital Solutions."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off by walking through the numbers for this quarter and the last 12 months, and then I'll touch on a few other items I want to cover today. I'll be making references to pages in our earnings presentation, so please feel free to have that available to follow along. To start off, we are pleased to report that since we've been a public company for two years, this is the first quarter, we can report LTM comparisons, which are reflected in our earnings presentation. As you know, we report quarterly, but we really run our business with a two to five-year view in LTM info and not just quarterly results provides a more fulsome picture of the progress we've made across our business. So, some key highlights of our results through March 31 include total revenues up 44%, FRE up 40%, DE up 41%, and our dividend is up 35%, all on an LTM basis versus a year ago. So, in the midst of this market turbulence, we continue to post solid results, which supports what we have been saying for the past two years. We built our business with a foundation of permanent capital and steady predictable management fee cash flows. We don't have lumpy volatile carried interest revenues flowing through our P&L. So, our business model and growth profile look different than our peers. And this will continue to differentiate us in the diversified alt industry. To put some numbers to this, for the past two years, our peers had on average 30% to 35% of the total asset management revenues, come from lumpy volatile carried interest cash flows. Again just very different models than us. Okay, let's step to our results through March 31, in more detail, management fees are up $483 million or 55% for the LTM period versus a year ago broken down by strategy, direct lending management fees are up $242 million or 51, GP Capital Solutions management fees were up $169 million or 44, and real-estate management fees are up $72 million or over 400%. But keep in mind, we acquired our real estate business at the end of 2021, this is obviously very considerable growth that we've been able to accomplish. Compensation expense came in, in line with our expectations at approximately 27% comp to revenue. G&A expense came in also in line with our expectations at $48 million for the quarter. Placement costs were a little elevated due to a large closing in our ORTF II BDC. Overall, we are trending in line with our expectations and guidance of G&A expense trending up a little in 2023 from last year. FRE is up $246 million or 40% for the LTM period versus a year ago and we continue to be right on track with our 60% FRE margin guidance for 2023. And we announced a dividend of $0.14 per share for the first quarter. For the LTM period, we have paid $0.50 in dividends versus $0.37 for a year-ago period. That results in a 35% increase in our dividend for the LTM period. Now I'd like to spend a moment on our fundraising efforts. We were pleased with our results for the quarter, in particular, considering the very challenging fundraising environment we're in. As a reminder, as you can see on Slide 12, in the first quarter of 2022, we raised $3.9 billion and now in the first quarter of 2023, we raised $3.8 billion. And on an LTM comparative basis, we raised $24.7 billion through March 31 versus $11.3 billion for the prior year, an increase of approximately 120%. And one of the toughest fundraising environment that we've seen in some time, we more than doubled our fundraise levels. I'll break down the 1Q '23 numbers across our strategies and products. In direct lending, we raised $1.9 billion, $1.2 billion raised in our diversified lending strategy, including almost $600 million raised in our retail distributed core income BDC ORCIC. And over $700 million raised in our tech lending strategies, including almost $200 million raised in our retail distributed tech lending BDC ORCIC. In GP Capital Solutions, we raised over $300 million. And in real estate, we raised over $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion in our real estate Fund VI, which we remain on track with our Investor Day goals of raising $5 billion for this product, and $300 million for our net lease trust product, our new non-traded REIT. We continue to see strong institutional interest in our products and the wealth channel rebounded in March from our lows in February. Although we expect in certain areas, continued pressure on the wealth channel. As we discussed on last quarter's call, as we progress through 2023, we continue to expect fundraising to tilt institutional although timing is always challenging to predict. In particular, in times of market disruption and dislocation. Turning to some of our wealth products, we continue to be very encouraged by the net fundraising levels we continue to see from our products that have quarterly redemption features. As Doug pointed out, we are still seeing strong net positive inflows with these products with gross inflows running at about 5 times the level of redemptions. All in all, we've raised approximately $29 billion of fee-paying AUM since Jan 1, 2022. As it relates to our AUM metrics, on Slide 11, AUM grew $42.4 billion to $144.4 billion, a 42% increase from the first quarter a year ago. Fee-paying AUM grew $26 billion to $91.6 billion, a 40% increase from the first quarter a year ago. Both metrics-driven primarily by capital raised and deployment in direct lending, capital raised in GP Capital Solutions Fund V, capital raised in real estate Fund VI, in LP and NLT, and the addition of our CLO business. Permanent capital grew $28.7 billion to a $114.3 billion, a 34% increase from the first quarter a year ago. As a reminder, 93% of our management fees are from these permanent capital vehicles. AUM not yet paying fees was $11.7 billion including $7.6 billion in-direct lending, $1.2 billion in GP Capital Solutions, and $2.9 billion in real estate. This AUM corresponds to an expected increase in annual management fees totaling over $155 million once deployed, which equates to a fee rate of over 1.3%, which speaks to the quality of the capital raised. In direct lending, we had gross originations of $1.6 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $1.3 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months, to $18.8 billion with $12.2 billion of net funded deployment. So, as it relates to the $7.6 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us a little over two quarters to fully deploy this based on our average net-funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. Although our current deployment pace is a little slower than that. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to be in a strong capital position. As you can see on Slide 17, we currently have a significant amount of liquidity with an average 13-year maturity and low 2.9%, cost of borrowing. So, summing it all up, another great quarter, although it is a challenging fundraising environment, we continue to make good progress and grow at industry-leading levels. We have always talked about the importance of our permanent capital in our business model and this is exactly why. Our fee-paying AUM grows more meaningfully versus our peers. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, this is all a testament to our business model of strong predictable high-margin growth. We are very pleased with our results, we delivered strong growth in all of our key metrics. AUM, fee-paying AUM, management fees, FRE and DE with each of these metrics up 40% or more year-over-year. Thank you again to everyone who has joined us on the call today. With that, operator, will we please open the line for questions? Thanks, Patrick, good morning. It's Alan. We still feel-good about being in and around our targets, but let me let me add a couple of thoughts to that. Since we posted these targets. A year-ago, the world has changed quite a bit, right. This has been one of the most challenging fundraising environment we've seen in a very long time. Yet our fundraise is up a 120% year-over-year. So we're still really confident in our outsized growth trajectory. Our retail flows have held up extremely well despite the environment and we're really pleased with our results, 40% plus year-over-year growth in every key metric of our business. There is a lot of hypotheticals, that we could kick around. And yes, there is more volatility. And yes, the range of outcomes is wider as Doug just mentioned. Then what than before. But we feel-good about being in and around our targets."

            "name": "Michael Rees",
            "content": "Thank you, Marc. Our GP Capital Solutions business was active in the first quarter of 2023, moving dialogue forward on potential investments and working with many partner managers as they continue to expand and diversify their businesses. Despite what has broadly been characterized as a more challenging fundraising environment, our focus on the largest firms within the alternatives universe has positioned our platform well to capture the ongoing secular tailwinds towards alternatives. We continue to see the market share of the largest managers expand and this phenomenon seems to accelerate during times of market volatility. In the past couple of years, mega funds of $1 billion or more in the private capital industry have accounted for 65% of the capital raised. Looking at 2022, this concentration is more like 70% to 75%, a clear indicator of the value of having scale and a strong brand. We think our partner managers have certainly benefited from this dynamic with most achieving or exceeding their fundraising targets, despite greater near-term headwinds. Total invested commitments for Dyal V including agreements and principles remain around $9 billion of capital committed or roughly 70% of the funds. The forward pipeline is robust and we continue to evaluate numerous opportunities that are quite attractive. Performance across Dyal Funds remained strong with a net IRR of 23.1% for Fund III, 50.2% for Fund IV, and 31.9% for Fund V, all of which compare favorably to the median returns for private-equity funds of the same vintages. We held a close for our professional sports minority investment strategy during the first quarter, bringing commitments for that strategy to over $500 million. Looking ahead, we're excited about what the next year holds for the GP Capital Solutions business, we continue to expand the breadth of our potential investor base institutionally and in the wealth channel, and still anticipate launching conversations for Fund VI later this year. With that, I will turn things over to Alan to discuss our financial results."

            "name": "Douglas Ostrover",
            "content": "Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another strong quarter of results for Blue Owl, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business model in the midst of volatile market conditions. Over the past year, a year marked by substantial interest-rate hikes, persistently high inflation, and considerable swings in the public markets, we have achieved over 40% growth on the key metrics we use to evaluate our business, including management fees, FRE, and DE, all while maintaining an industry-leading 60% FRE margin. And we feel like we're just getting started. The past couple of months have demonstrated the value of having durable permanent capital, which means we are never a forced seller in precarious markets and which allows us to deploy incremental capital into some of the most attractive opportunities we've seen in some time. We believe our focus on downside protected, income-generating strategies, resonates more than ever against the backdrop of a more unpredictable near-term environment. And we are hearing the sentiment echoed in our conversations with existing and prospective investors. Since January 1, 2022, we have raised approximately $29 billion of fee-paying capital across equity and debt, which compares to our fee-paying AUM of $61 billion at the end of 2021, almost 50% growth. All three of our verticals have contributed to this growth and we have seen roughly equal inflows from our institutional and private wealth clients. This is a very strong organic growth on an absolute basis. And when you consider the more difficult fundraising environment that we've been in for the last year, we're incredibly proud of what we've accomplished thus far. Importantly, we also continue to see a very modest redemption class from the small percentage of our products which offer a quarterly redemption feature with just $248 million requested in the first quarter or less than 1% of AUM in those products during a period marked by heightened market volatility and investor uncertainty. This compares to over $1 billion raised in those same products. So, we remain solidly in net inflows status. From a deployment perspective, a more tumultuous market can result in temporary slowdowns and transaction volumes as buyers, sellers, and intermediaries pause to take stock of the market landscape, as we've seen on numerous occasions over the past year. We think these are exactly the types of markets that further accelerate the value proposition for and the adoption of the solutions that we offer across direct lending, GP Solutions, and triple-net lease real estate. We saw this play out during COVID and we're seeing it now. While sponsors have been deploying capital at a slower pace in recent quarters, they have turned to the direct lending market in greater fashion for the deals they are announcing. Our GP solutions business has continued to offer valuable capital to the growing upper-middle market GP community and with our $13 billion Fund V fully raised and already 70% committed, we will be looking ahead to Fund VI in short order. And for our real-estate business, the current interest-rate environment has made it even more attractive for companies to consider a net lease solution for their capital needs. We are pleased with the $1.5 billion we raised in real estate in the first quarter and the over $4 billion raised in the last six months, particularly given the market environment. So, what you're hearing from us is that our playbook remains unchanged despite the many things changing around us. We're focused on raising long-duration and mostly permanent capital from institutional and private wealth clients, both of whom continue to grow their allocations to alternatives. We are putting that capital to work with the same selectivity and rigorous underwriting standards, we've always utilized and we continue to innovate through new product development, while carefully evaluating the many inorganic opportunities that present themselves. We're very pleased with the growth that we've been able to deliver for shareholders thus far. Blue Owl's significant permanent capital base is a foundational and intentional differentiator for us, creating a stable base off of which to grow. And our management fee-centric earnings position us well to deliver steady progress against various market backdrops without the substantial volatility that our peers have from carried interest. Our growth has been outsized relative to peers, other financial companies, and broader market industries, and with our newly fixed annual dividend of $0.56 per share for 2023, we are offering an attractive dividend yield of roughly 5% and expect to continue to grow that dividend meaningfully in the coming years. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc to give you an update on our direct lending and real estate business. Marc? Hey, Craig. It's Doug. Let me make a couple of comments on fundraising in general, and then I'll get into the funds in the market. So, first of all, you've heard from a lot of people, it's definitely a difficult fundraising environment, but from what we're seeing, the secular tailwinds for all, it really hasn't changed. And I think you'd agree with this when there's, market volatility when we're having bank failures, it certainly makes fundraising more difficult. Our products and I'll get into those in a moment, have high-current income inflation protection and obviously downside protection. And when, I look at what we've done through \u201822 and the first-quarter of \u201823. Alan referenced as we've grown our assets by 40%. And this will start to get to your question. Not only have we grown assets, but these are assets that have really attractive fees and very attractive margins. It's not insurance money, it's not CLOs, it's not 10 to 30 basis-point money, this is a good fees and good carry. So look, as we sit here today, obviously the spectrum of outcomes, a little wider, and I'd say, for me, it's a little incrementally, it's a little more difficult to predict the timing of fundraising. But we are seeing significant demand for all of our strategies. We've invested heavily in distribution globally and we're continuing to invest the funds. Have a great track-record, and so can tell you the exact timing, but we still feel really good about our ability to generate meaningful growth. The big fund-raise we have in the market right now is on Oak Street VI, we've raised just under $3 billion. We have a hard cap with 5. We feel really good about hitting that cap. We're still in the market with our Tech BDC Tech II. I think we just surpassed $4 billion, Alan, and we'll wrap that up. And, I think that's kind of in-line with expectations and we're excited and I think will generate great returns with that capital. And then we have a number of sub-strategies which I can go through with you in the credit space. And of course there some SMAs as well. And then, I do have to admit away from institutional. We have three things in the market and private wealth and. While flows have slowed we're still doing pretty well in that space as well. Sure. Look it's a very, very good it's a good environment to be a private capital solutions provider a bit large and in a triple-net lease. I think that dynamic is very-very visible for us. We see it in terms of the number of companies that are engaged, interested, the number of properties, the terms on which we can buy it. I think by any measure, this is a really appealing time to be offering in alternative solution when you don't have. The kind of traditional functioning markets even less. So we do very well and we've done very well for 12 years with highly functional markets around when the markets are not functional that much better. So the pipeline is very strong and it gets down to one simple observation that comes out of all that, which is the end-of-the day, what we are offering with triple net lease is a type of credit. It's a type of financing solution. But it's even better because you also own a strategic physical asset underneath it, but with a 15, 20-year lease with all the expenses paid by the tenants. So, point of view the investor inflation is mitigated. So it's really a wonderful way to make an extremely low-vol predictable long-term return. But for the user of the capital for the company to get right to your question if you don't have simple functioning markets whether that's a bank market, bond market, or otherwise then it's quite more appealing to say, well, listen, I do have this warehouse side, do have this build and, we operate out of, I have this manufacturing facility, why do I need to be in the -- own the real estate business. I should be able to make a much higher return in my core business. And so, they turned to us and we're by far the leader in this space as you know. So, we're seeing the benefits of that and not surprisingly, let's comment on more attractive terms today than it did a year ago. The cap rates that we can buy out or even better. So, yes, it's a very appealing environment for us. I'd say also from the point of view, the investors, we have a strategy that is so distinctive from any other real estate strategy out there, right? We don't own releasing risk, we don't own the uncertainties of the commercial market, we don't run highly levered strategies. So, it's a good -- it's a good time for this business. Sure. Look, just this ongoing -- whatever term, what we are applied to it -- to apply to it but this banking transition, I don't know if it's a crisis or not, but it certainly a meaningful shift in the market. So, let me headline with, yes, it presents opportunities for Blue Owl. It presents opportunities for direct lending and private capital solutions in general. So, I'd say that with the clear observation, it's not like any of us like to see these things happen, nobody likes to see and I -- none of us do want to see banks that are having kind of evaporate, these are great businesses that have been built over time. And it's not helpful to the markets in aggregate when you have this kind of capital disruption. But for purposes also that will be clear on this call. Yes, it's a positive for us. I mean, the reality is, and I'll say this at least qualitatively, we know that when you take a lot of capital out of the system and in fact, the regional banks, where some of the only banks left, that's still actually lend money to companies. Right? That is to say, the large money center banks have long ago migrated really out of the balance sheet business into the securities business, into the -- they're moving as opposed to storage business. The regional banks actually would still show up and provide capital and while we did frequently overlap in the same companies given that scale, very large scale that we participate in, there certainly was some presence. So, qualitatively, it's very clear, this is going to mean more demand or I should say, the same demand for capital and fewer suppliers of it. The suppliers that remain, the regional banks that stay in place, it's also apparent that they're going to have a higher cost of capital. And so, all of that means more opportunity, the quantitative effects, too early to quantify is definitively a positive number as to how positive, I guess it also depends just how much -- how many more of these ripples there aren't in the system, but it has been -- it's been disrupt dividends. I think also amplified for people, the power of our model, which is having permanent capital, long-dated capital to meet long-dated needs, works, it's good for the economy, it's good for the capital markets, private markets through all these times it picture the weekend of SVB. And we were talking about how do we provide capital to make sure that we had capital available, ready to go and that's been true last weekend with First Republic, we at the end of the day, are here is a study provider. So, I think the direct lending business has proven to be really a stabilizing force for the market get (ph) launch. So, it's capital -- it's opportunity coming our way, I think it is allowing our marketplace to continue to provide something important for the economy. And in terms of what that might I'll translate into, we've got the infrastructure. So, to answer your question specifically, no, we don't need to build infrastructure, this is what we do. We've looked at and I think about 8,000 different loans to make the hundreds that we have. So, we're fully built. So, this is more opportunity, again we don't say it gleefully, we don't want to get it this way, but yes, we are a beneficiary. Yeah. So, let me start on net lease trust. We are on one platform, we've had a lot of success. We thought we'd be on a few more by this time. By -- it's just taking a little bit longer given everything that's going on in the markets. I think by -- in the next six months, we should be on another three to four wirehouses. So, I'm -- I feel pretty good that hopefully we can triple, quadruple the amount of monthly, quarterly fundraising in that product. There's definitely a lot of interest, it's just taking a bit longer. And the other products we are we continue to add wirehouses. I think those platforms -- those syndicates are largely built for us. And I would predict that net lease trust by the end of the year will be our single largest syndicate. Well, thank you, everyone, I'm -- we are really proud of our results this quarter, especially in light of what's been going on in the markets and we're grateful for the support and partnership. I have to add, though, on a personal note, I don't understand how our stock is trading at $10.60. You've heard from the team, our income streams are very predictable, our margins are consistent, we've got permanent capital and I would say that our revenue is probably the most predictable of any alternative asset manager. Most importantly, our dividend yield is now 5% and we've signaled that our dividend will be materially higher next year and the year after. So, it feels like to me and the team that this is going to be a very good entry point for investors. Again, I want to thank everyone for the time and look forward to following up in the days ahead. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Blue Owl Capital's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. During the presentation, your lines will remain on listen-only. I'd like to advise all parties that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ann Dai, Head of Investor Relations for Blue Owl.\nAnn Dai: Thanks, Operator, and good morning to everyone. Joining me today are Marc Lipschultz, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company's control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in Blue Owl Capital's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We'd also like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, available on the shareholder section of our website at blueowl.com. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blue Owl fund. This morning, we issued our financial results for the third quarter of 2024, reporting fee-related earnings or FRE of $0.22 per share and distributable earnings or DE of $0.20 per share. We also declared a dividend of $0.18 per share for the third quarter, payable on November 22nd to holders of record as of November 11th. During the call today, we'll be referring to the earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning, so please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Lipschultz: Great, thank you so much, Ann. During the third quarter, Blue Owl continued to generate extremely strong growth while making significant progress on our strategic M&A goals, further diversifying our business and positioning us well to participate in the transformational shifts happening within the financial markets. Over the last 12 months, we've grown management fees by 26%, fee-related earnings by 27%, and distributable earnings by 22%, all compared to the prior year period. Looking back further, we have grown management fees by nearly 200% and FRE by over 150% in just three and a half years, representing 14 consecutive quarters of growth in these metrics. We've achieved these impressive results through inflationary periods, geopolitical events, rate volatility, and a significant slowdown in capital markets, highlighting the stability and strength of our business and the durability of our earnings. And the vast majority of this growth has been organic, driven by a handful of factors which we think make Blue Owl's business model very distinct. One, we have extremely high levels of permanent capital, meaning few assets lead the system. For many of our products, there is zero redemption, so every incremental dollar of assets raised contributes to our earnings layer cake. Two, our earnings are essentially all management fee-driven, so we don't experience the same type of volatility or uncertainty that many others see during periods of market transition, as we've observed. Three, our business is geared towards the largest secular trends within the alternative asset market. These include the growth of direct lending, the increasing importance of alternatives in the wealth channel, a growing number of investment-grade companies looking for bespoke capital solutions like net lease, and the rising capital needs of alternative asset managers themselves. And this is intentional positioning. It has been by design that we chose to be in these markets, because this is where we saw the greatest divergence in the demand and supply of capital, and observed meaningful shifts in how certain markets are financed. On its own, I believe our organic growth has been quite impressive, particularly given market conditions these past few years. However, as many of you know, strategic M&A has been a key component of our strategy since we started our business. And in the past year, we have made select and modest sized acquisitions to supplement Blue Owl's core growth. These have been focused on specific areas of the market where we anticipate meaningful capital needs and strong investor interest. In other words, we are further positioning ourselves to be on the forefront of trends that will define the alternatives industry in the coming decade. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced an acquisition of IPI's business, reflecting a significant step forward in Blue Owl's presence in the digital infrastructure ecosystem. There is massive demand for data centers and very low vacancy, catalyzed by data storage needs and the proliferation of generative AI tools. IPI is one of the most scaled data center developers, owners, and operators in the world, owning roughly 4% of the world's hyperscale capacity. Their tenants include some of the largest hyperscalers and AI companies globally. We're talking about excellent counterparties, on average rated AA, and the capital investment of these enterprises is expected to measure in the trillions of dollars over the next several years. There is a huge demand, supply imbalance in this market, which relates to both the scale capital needed to fund the new development, as well as the expertise required to successfully source, develop, and operate these properties. Taking together, this dynamic creates a very high barrier-to-entry and is one of the reasons we are so enthused about this acquisition. There are a lot of companies talking about being in the data center space today, but there are very few that actually have the skill set, proven record, and deep relationships to do what IPI does, and that's why they're decidedly a leader in the market. Within the context of Blue Owl, IPI will be very complimentary to what we have in place today. Our current net lease business has a much wider mandate across multiple types of real estate, while IPI is a pure play on digital infrastructure, and one of the few managers out there that offers funds solely focused on data centers. We anticipate numerous synergies in bringing them on board, considering the firm's strong relationships with the hyperscaler community, modest investor overlap between Blue Owl and IPI, and an opportunity to create very interesting and differentiated products for the wealth distributed market, where Blue Owl has built a very strong franchise with CIC, TIC, and ORENT. This acquisition, like others we've announced, was a proprietary discussion centered around the benefits and synergies of joining Blue Owl. We think our M&A strategy is something between buy and build, a hybrid model where we are bringing on teams who excel at what they do and are scaled in their market. In joining Blue Owl, they can access incremental resources and distribution platforms that supplement and accelerate strong growth that already exists. Most of the employees on these teams see basically no change in their day-to-day, but the platform level, the synergies can be very impactful. There are numerous similarities between IPI and Atalaya, which closed during the third quarter. Atalaya's deep expertise in asset-backed finance, combined with their almost 20-year track record through market cycles, complements Blue Owl's direct lending business nicely, and we're thrilled that they are officially a part of Blue Owl. We see both digital infrastructure and alternative credit as multi-trillion-dollar markets with transformational shifts happening in real time. Through these acquisitions, we have established an expanded foothold in these areas, and similar to Oak Street, we believe we can drive multiplicative growth over time. Collectively, these new additions have been modest, with initial consideration of roughly $2.5 billion for all the transactions announced in 2024, or less than 10% of our market count. So in the early days, none of these businesses will be highly impactful to our revenues or earnings on their own, because they're just not that big. But over the next three, five, seven years, we look forward to demonstrating and quantifying the significant value creation that we are already seeing in some ways across the platform. Just to give a couple of early data points around this, our real estate credit team has already identified and created deal flow for the liquid portion of ORENT's portfolio and for our insurance solutions platform, which closed in July. Similarly, Atalaya and our credit teams have been active in sourcing investment-grade flow, and across Blue Owl, we have tripled the pipeline of private alpha and beta plus opportunities for insurance. Separately, we are hard at work on a commingled real estate credit product that should launch later this year or early next year, and our teams began driving towards this goal prior to Prima's closing. When it comes to integration, we start work streams very early, before our deals are even announced, and by closing, these businesses are largely integrated into Blue Owl, as demonstrated by the examples I just highlighted. Moving on to the quarter, we had our second highest quarter fundraising with $7.9 billion of equity capital raised and $12 billion, including debt, private wealth fundraising constituted $4.2 billion, a record quarter for this channel, driven by our perpetually distributed and fundraised for GP stakes. Gross inflows into our perpetually distributed products were $2.5 billion in the third quarter and $9.3 billion over the last 12 months, or 67% higher than the prior 12-month period. We continue to make strong inroads in this vast and growing market for alternatives and wealth, supported by our incumbency and strong relationships in this market. The level of trust that we have built with distributors through our thoughtful partnership and high-touch service continues to bear fruit. And just this quarter, we formally launched The Nest at wealth.blueowl.com to further that engagement. The Nest features educational content, portfolio construction resources, and more to guide advisors and their clients in their journey to learn about alternative markets. We'll also have an exciting conversation with platforms regarding new product development in areas such as alternative credit and digital infrastructure. Our partners continue to look to Blue Owl for differentiated products with attractive and downside-protected income objectives and thought leadership. This is true during strong markets, but particularly true during times of uncertainty. We raised $3.6 billion from institutional investors, from a number of strategies across the platform, complementing our robust flows in private wealth and reflecting the ongoing diversification of fundraising across our platform. In total, we have raised over $38 billion organically across equity and debt over the past 12 months. That's equivalent to approximately 25% of our AUM a year ago that we've raised in 12 months, and that is prior to contributions we anticipate from Atalaya, IPI, and new products we plan to have in market in the coming quarters. Turning to business performance. In credit, we had another robust quarter of deployment with nearly $11 billion of gross originations and net deployments were roughly 40% of that, resulting in a last 12-month net deployment pace of nearly $18 billion, up nearly 140% year-over-year during a period where broadly syndicated markets were very active. Direct lending metrics remain strong. On average, underlying revenue growth and EBITDA growth was high single digits across the portfolio with no significant step-ups in non-accruals or amendment requests. In alternative credit, we have experienced strong demand for the capital solutions we offer and recently announced an agreement for certain Blue Owl, formerly Atalaya Funds, to purchase up to $2 billion of loans from Upstart over the next 18 months. We've always highlighted the advantage of having scale in these markets in which we participate, and this is a great example of how Atalaya's team has brought diverse and long data pools of capital together to transact in size in one of their core markets. In GP stakes, we continue to position ourselves around two substantial secular trends, growing allocations to alternatives and GP consolidation. Collectively, our partner managers now manage over $2.1 trillion, providing us with a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the industry. We continue to see the big getting bigger, and we continue to see scaled managers increasingly selected as the partners of choice by allocators. Since the end of the second quarter, we've also completed two strip sales of assets in GP Stakes Fund 3 for what is expected to be roughly 15% of the fund's interests, providing liquidity for investors, while bringing in a new set of investors to Blue Owl. We've seen the number of allocators interested in GP Stakes continue to expand, and these transactions represent a creative way to offer access to our pool of notable partner managers while affirming Blue Owl's leading position in the space. In real estate, we continue to actively deploy capital and net lease at very attractive cap rates behind our four major themes, digital infrastructure, on-shoring, healthcare real estate, and essential retail. The capital needs in each of these areas remains very significant, and we continue to expect we'll be approximately 60% committed for Fund VI by year-end after just completing fundraising in the first quarter of this year. We are now underway on our new net lease Europe strategy and are on track to be at or above our $1 billion target by the first quarter of 2025. To bring it all together, there is clearly a lot more to the Blue Owl story today than there was last year, but the big picture has not changed. We continue to focus on finding areas with significant capital needs, like data centers and alternative credit, and we are raising large pools of long-dated capital to address those needs. We now have scaled platforms to address the institutional, private wealth, and insurance markets, and we continue to add new and differentiated products with the same underlying characteristics of income generation and downside protection. For our shareholders, the proposition remains simple. Our revenues come from durable permanent capital with best-in-class fee rates, and our earnings are made up entirely of fee-related earnings, which are coming from increasingly diversified sources. We think this makes our business quite unique and compelling, and well-positioned for continued strong and stable growth. With that, let me turn it to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with the results we reported this quarter, with continued strong trends across key metrics such as revenue and earnings growth, fundraising, and deployment. Our 14th consecutive quarter of management fee and FRE growth, our second-strongest fundraising quarter ever, coming from increasingly diverse sources and a record fundraising quarter in private wealth. Those statistics have been driven almost entirely by our organic growth, and as we start to layer in the impact of the new businesses we've brought on, we're very excited about what lies ahead. Let's go through some of our key highlights on an LTM year-over-year basis through September 30th. Management fees are up 26%, and 91% of these management fees are from permanent capital vehicles. FRE is up 27%, and DE is up 22%. As you can see on Slide 13, we raised $7.9 billion of equity in the third quarter and $24.2 billion for the last 12 months, an increase of 67% from the prior last 12-month period. I'll break down the third quarter fundraising numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised $3.1 billion. $2.4 billion was raised in our direct lending strategies, of which $1.5 billion came from our non-traded diversified BDC, OCIC, 65% more than what we raised in the third quarter of 2023. Inclusive of the October 1 close, we are nearing $14 billion raised for OCIC since inception. The remainder was raised primarily through insurance solutions and in strategic equity. In GP strategic capital, we raised $3.5 billion during the quarter, including $2.4 billion across our large cap strategies latest fund and co-invest vehicles, bringing the latest vintage to $5.3 billion. And we remain confident in our ability to achieve our $13 billion goal by the end of 2025. We also raised capital in our GP financing strategy and the new vehicle raise in connection with the strip sale that occurred during the third quarter. And in real estate, we raised $1.3 billion primarily from ORENT, insurance solutions, and early capital flows for our European net lease strategy. We are pleased with the increasing breadth of fundraising across strategies and products. Of the $7.9 billion of equity raised in the third quarter, over 20% came from strategies which did not exist or were not part of our platform a year ago. And this will continue to expand with our new business acquisitions and overall organic growth. And remember, we don't look at our fundraising dollar for dollar with others, because the dollars we are raising are much more valuable. Our assets are stiffer because we are raising mostly permanent capital. For example, during the quarter, we raised approximately $3 for every $1 that went out. And most of that $1 was distributions from our income products. Our fee rates are also much higher on average and our margins compare favorably. Taken together, the profitability on each dollar raised is substantially greater. It does not compare. On the acquisition front, Kuvare asset management closed in early July, adding $21.6 billion to AUM at close and contributing almost a billion dollars of gross inflows during the quarter. And at the end of the third quarter, Adelaide also closed, adding $10.6 billion to AUM. Pro forma for our acquisition of IPI, our AUM is approximately a quarter of a trillion dollars. As a reminder, we also have substantial embedded earnings in our business. AUM not yet paying fees with $21.7 billion as of the end of the third quarter, corresponding to over $260 million of incremental annual management fees once deployed. This number has increased from $12.6 billion this time last year, reflecting incremental assets raised and strategies that earn fees upon deployment, as well as some of the new businesses we have brought on. We also have approximately $135 million of incremental management fees that will turn on upon the listing of our remaining private technology lending BDCs over time. These two items alone would represent an increase in management fees of roughly 20%. These aspects, combined with our business model of being virtually all permanent capital and 100% FRE, just gives us a higher quality of earnings than any of our peers in the industry. Moving on to our credit platform, we had gross originations of $10.9 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $4.3 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $47 billion with nearly $18 billion of net funded deployment, a record for Blue Owl. Our credit portfolio returned 3.3% in the third quarter and 15.2% over the last 12 months. Weighted average LTVs remain in the high 30s across direct lending and in the low 30s, specifically in our software lending portfolio. For our GP strategic capital platform, total invested capital for our fifth GP states fund, including agreements in principle, are over $11.6 billion of capital with line of sight into over $3 billion of opportunities, which if all are signed would bring us well through the remaining capital available in Fund V. Performance across these funds remains strong with a net IRR of 23% for Fund III, 39% for Fund IV, and 15% for Fund V. And in real estate, our net lease pipeline continues to grow with over $22 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract eclipse. As Marc mentioned earlier, we think we could be roughly 60% committed for Fund VI by year end, reflecting the strong demand we're seeing for our net lease solution. Many of these opportunities are built-to-suit arrangements, which are very capital efficient for the Senate and where we get a premium cap rate for providing a flexible, balance sheet friendly solution to our apartments. These can take between 18 and 24 months to fully deploy the capital we've committed. And as a reminder, we charge management fees mostly on invested capital, so we will earn incremental management fees as this capital is deployed. With seeing such strong deployment opportunities, this could position us well to be out in the market with the next vintage of this strategy before the end of next year. With regards to performance, gross returns across our real estate portfolio were 3.8% for the last 12 months, comparing favorably to the broader real estate market over this time period. The net IRR across our fully realized funds has been 24% for investment grade and credit-worthy tenant risk, reflecting the favorable value creation driven by our scale and solutions-based partnerships. Finally, our real estate credit team drove approximately $1 billion of gross deployment across SMAs, Insurance Solutions, and ORENT in their first full quarter on the Blue Owl platform, highlighting the benefits of combining their experience and investment expertise with a broader pool of capital with more diverse objectives. The team has been able to capitalize on deal flow they already see, which did not have a natural home previously. Okay, let's wrap up with a few closing thoughts. We are extremely proud of our record of creating value for shareholders. Since our listing, we have delivered greater than 30% annual growth rates for management fees, FRE revenue, and FRE, and we have and will continue to focus on delivering the bulk of our earnings to shareholders as dividends. To that end, I wanted to spend a moment on our 2025 dividends. We want to provide one further update as we head into the end of this enormously successful chapter and turn our attention to our next exciting chapter, which we will be discussing in detail at our investor day on February 7th. As we think about the dividends, we are incorporating a variety of factors, but there are two specific ones we want to call out. First, we will factor in the very volatile interest rate environment we are in, and second, we will consider the tremendous growth potential in our existing and newly acquired businesses. As it relates to interest rates, we note the wide range of outcomes that could play out in 2025 as reflected in the rather dramatic movements in SOFR forward curves recently. By way of example, over the last number of months, from peak to trough, the forward SOFR curve average for 2025 declined over 130 basis points, and since that time has moved back up material. We will want to incorporate the potential for another meaningful decline in SOFR curves and its potential impact on Part 1 fees into our thinking around setting a dividend. As for future growth, we want to retain some additional capital flexibility to invest behind our new strategic additions like data centers, asset back credit, and insurance solutions, where the reception has been extremely strong. We aspire to do in these markets what we have done over the past almost 10 years in our current markets. The addressable markets are large enough and early enough to make this an ambitious, but a very real possibility. Altogether, while we guided toward a likely dividend in the mid $0.90 on our last call, we currently expect a dividend closer to $0.90 in order to reflect a wide range of outcomes in SOFR. This means our payout ratio will flex a little with the ultimate level of SOFR in 2025, since we are taking a more conservative approach to where we're setting our dividend. To the extent the curve doesn't play out this way, to the extent the curve is higher in 2025, this approach allows us additional capital flexibility around strategic growth plans. A dividend around $0.90 would reflect a near 30% annual dividend growth rate since we went public and around 25% dividend growth year-over-year. We will finalize our thinking around this and announce the full year dividend for 2025 during next quarter's earnings call. Overall, we continue to put up very strong growth across every key aspect of our business. We are raising capital and more funds from a broader set of investors across more asset classes than we ever have, and that will continue to expand with the new businesses that are just joining the platform, which are already well integrated from where we are collaborating on deal flow and moving forward with new product development. As we spoke about last quarter, we think our acquisition of Oak Street is the right blueprint for how to think about the value creation possible when these platforms join Blue Owl, roughly tripling AUM and revenues in under three years through one of the toughest periods for real estate as an asset class. It's a testament to one, the quality of the real estate team, two, the preparation and thought that goes into our M&A execution playbook, three, the integration plan we put in place for these acquisitions, and four, overall fundraising capabilities across Blue Owl. We are bringing on businesses that have achieved great success on their own and have very strong expertise in their respective fields, and we are providing the resources and platform scale that will help them reach the next level. All of this put together, we believe we can continue to lead the alternative asset management industry in all of the key growth metrics that we continue to talk about, management fees, FRE revenues, and FRE. With that, I'd like to thank everyone who has joined us on the call today. Operator, can we please open the line for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. So maybe just starting with the dividend in your last point there, I appreciate you guys obviously won't give us a whole lot of color, probably beyond '25 for now, but just philosophically knowing where you guys have come from, where you set the dividend originally, what payout you set originally, how are you thinking about the payout in the dividend structure over time? Is that still fair to assume that dividend will grow in line with FRE, in line with total earnings, in line with total earnings per share? How do you think about it off of this $.90 point?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. And you're right, this is a dividend question. It's not necessarily an earnings question with my last comments. So we obviously outlined in our prepared remarks that over the last number of months, the SOFR curve average for '25 dropped by a lot, 130, 140 basis points. That could be up to a nickel impact on our per share basis. The SOFR curve since then has obviously come back a bit, but we have to take a conservative approach to how we set our dividend because we're setting it up a full year in advance. So on previous calls, we've talked a bit about the impact of rates on our Part 1 fees, that we have a business that is to some degree sensitive to SOFR levels. And we mentioned that if rates end up higher, then we have more capital that we can allocate to strategic initiatives. We have a lower payout ratio. So that payout ratio will continue to flex. And I guess to some extent, for a minute, let's pull the lens back just to put this all in perspective. As a reminder, when we had our Investor Day back in May of 2022, we called for a 35% annualized revenue growth through the end of 2025. We'll end up posting, let's say low 30% growth for that timeframe. So we're about 10% off and the dividend about 10% off. When you look at our low 30% annual growth compared to our peers growth over the same time period, we're about 2 to 2.5 times the average of our peers. And so, the focus on the dividend certainly we think has overshadowed to some extent an extraordinary growth story here that will continue now to your point into 2025 and frankly, well beyond based on the recent acquisitions we've done. So we certainly think it's working. We'll have our Investor Day on February 7th. We're super excited to come out and talk about what we think we can do well beyond 2025. But if you just focus on 2025 for a minute, we think we'll continue to put up when you think about management fees, FRE revenue, FRE, similar growth rates in '25 is what we think we're going to post in 2024. So on an LTM basis, we're about 30% revenue growth right now. We are mid 20s or so, little over that in FRE. We think we can produce similar results, let's say upper 20s or more percent growth for revenues and next year and FRE, mid to upper 20s percent growth.\nAlex Blostein: All right, thanks, good.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Of course. Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Marc, Alan, good morning and hope everyone's doing well. Our question is on product innovation. So you guys have been very active on the M&A front. You have access to new capabilities in verticals where client demand trends and also performance are both strong. Can you talk about your ability to launch new products given these new capabilities in the private wealth vertical? And we're hoping to see some new products in the semi liquid wrapper over the year term.\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes, thank you very much. And really a critical question on a critical topic. When we take a look at over the last year, and frankly, last several years, as we've been very intentional about filling in product opportunities with two attributes, one most importantly, where we can deliver an exceptional risk adjusted return for the investors because of this match of supply and demand of capital. And importantly, where we can then also innovate product and product structure, so that as Blue Owl, we can continue our extremely strong growth rates. And so you're absolutely correct in putting your finger on what we can now do with things like alternative credit and with hyperscale data centers. So let me tease that out a little more. In both instances, and frankly, in all instances where we've acquired businesses, if you sort of think about this world of organic or inorganic growth, buy or build, what we've really landed on very intentionally is a hybrid strategy, maybe in the three bears, it's the just right strategy. And it's about how to take a absolute best of breed capability team and marry that together with the Blue Owl platform and be able to infuse superior or enhanced origination capabilities, enhanced operational support, and very importantly, to your point, product innovation. So lots of people are going to use the words alternative credit on their calls and their meetings, and lots of people are going to use the word data centers on their calls and in their meetings. But what does it take to really thrive in the business? What it takes is, again, outstanding skills, married with the right kind of innovation and platform. And I think that's exactly what we're offering. And that's why Adelaide chose to come to us and say, hey, we want to be a part of Blue Owl. That's why Iconic and Iron Point said, we want to join with the Blue Owl platform in order to be able to build our business further. These are proprietary deals done on an incredibly attractive basis. Consider that an IPI we're buying it at 13 times. These are businesses that others are buying for twice that level. And the problem with the opportunity that presents for us is to now take what is a 10 billion AUM business and to grow it at a really high rate like we did with Oak Street. So consider Oak Street, we had 10 billion of assets. We've now tripled the assets and tripled the revenues in that business. We see very similar opportunity sets in those two businesses. And you mentioned product innovation. With regard to product innovation, the wealth channel where we have developed such a strong set of partnerships and where we are the number one growth and net originator of wealth product, depending on how you measure it, one or two, we've really built a partnership of trust by bringing the right products in the right way to the wealth channel. And this is a really important point I'd emphasize. Not every product belongs in a continuously offered product form. Not everybody will successfully support products in the wealth channel. The attributes that count are durability. You want a strong income component. So if you think about alternative credit and you think about hyperscale data centers, our specialty with IPI, they are perfect matches for the wealth channel. So we see very, very significant growth ahead in those businesses. It's why Ivan and his team wanted to join us on old credit. It's why Matt, his team wanted to join us in hyperscale data centers because these people are the best in the business. And now we will bring them to new investor sets and expand the funnel of originations for them.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Marc, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi there. Maybe we could pick up where we just left off. So I definitely get, and I saw the progress you made with Oak Street on bringing the new strategy to the wealth platform in a permanent capital vehicle. So don't need to repeat what you just said there. These businesses, they have institutional businesses of their own. So I see the extension into the wealth platform and the synergies. Maybe we could talk about how they may or may not work together. In other words, one of the things we think about with a fully integrated platform is being able to deliver like a full solution to certain LPs as they consolidate GPs. Is that a plan? Is that like five years down the road? Is that something that's required? Is that something that you can do and have you cross-sold to LPs of your original three franchises? Thanks.\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. And collectively and ourselves included put, I don't want to say excess emphasis on wealth because it's a monumentally important and distinctive capability we have. But institutional growth has been incredibly important and absolutely made clear. Cross-selling has become very much a part of our business. And actually one of, again, the opportunities, you look at the overlap between our LP base, for example, and IPI's LP base, very limited. And in fact, they bring some incredible, very large pools of capital that we've not historically done business with. And so I think cross-selling is very much a part of that synergy that we all talk about. Again, what we don't want to do ever is disrupt the world-class investment capabilities and processes these firms already have. And that's part of, again, this sort of buy-build model. What we do want to do is enhance origination and enhance distribution. And you're absolutely correct. The institutional cross-sell is just as important. Doug Ostrover has been circling the globe talking to institutions. And the interest in these products when married to Blue Owl is a big part of the upside story. Remember, take a firm like Adelaide, which has been doing alternative credit for 20 years. Let me repeat that, 20 years. Everybody is going to talk about, hey, I'm going to get into alternative credit, partly because motivated by, hey, I want to have all solutions for all people. We don't want to have all solutions for all people. We want to have outstanding solutions in every area we participate in, and particularly in a series of products that are about downside protection, capital preservation, durability, often with an income component. We know who we are, and what we're going to do is not have every product, but we are going to have the best products. And Adelaide is the best in the business at alternative credit. And why would someone want to start and invest in someone's organic undertaking in a business where you have someone with 20 years of experience, they have data on 100 million different consumers. You need that data if you're going to do alternative credit successfully. You need the data analytics to come with decades of work. IPI, lots of people would love to build a data center for one of the hyperscalers, but the hyperscalers aren't going to build it with most people. They're going to build it with the people they know and trust. And the people that have, in the case of IPI, we have Stack, our captive operational team, that's 800 people that are experts in power management and conditioning, cooling, redundancy systems, siting, development, all of which are the skills that the Microsofts of the world and their peers need and count on. That's what they're paying for. They're not interested in someone saying, oh, I could do it for you too. So I think we've got to get down to bringing not every product. That's a different strategy. There are many firms are going all things to all people. What I think we can tell you is when we bring a strategy forward, it's going to be addressing a distinctive mismatch in capital. And we are going to be built to deliver best of breed results for our investors. And that will lead to best of breed growth for Blue Owl, institutional and wealth alike.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next, your next question comes from the line of Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.\nBrian McKenna: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I had a question on your core direct lending business. You've raised the majority of AUM today through your private BDCs. And obviously, you're raising through the wealth channel as well. So moving forward, you'll continue to raise AUM through your non-traded products, but what's the outlook for fundraising on the institutional side? Will you look to add some additional private BDCs or is there an opportunity for some GP, LP funds? I'm just trying to get a sense of the trajectory of direct lending fundraising from here.\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes, look, it obviously remains a central theme, of course, for us and for our investors, institutional and wealth alike. Again, we'll, which as you correctly just commented on wealth, it continues to be an incredible engine. We've continued to, in fact, we've had our record quarter in wealth and aggregate across all our products. We continue to develop very strong interest across platforms and within platforms for our direct lending product and very low redemption, so that's in a really, really healthy place. With regard to the sort of a prospect for growth in total, look, private BDCs, absolutely a continued option, depending on the exact strategy and how we want to build it as are GPLP funds, to your good point. Look, we've never wanted the structure to be either the impediment or the definition of what we do, what we want to do and have done is deliver the best results in credit. Remember, we've done $100 billion of loan originations and at a seven basis point running loss rate and delivered spectacular yields for our investors. What we want to make sure is that any investor that wants to participate in that has the on-ramp to do so, and the on-ramp doesn't define their result. Remember, we share every loan we have between any one of the relevant vehicles we develop and we have far fewer vehicles. So an investor in our program in any on-ramp is going to experience our best of breed results. And that's really important to us and should be really important to the investors, individuals and institutions alike. So if people want to come to us through a GPLP structure, we're very happy to do that. We do it with SMAs for some bespoke cases. We've clearly done it, as you said, with private BDCs that can then either be private or can become public BDCs. So we'll continue to develop innovate on-ramps to be able to access in the way that is best suited to the investor. So I think you can expect us to continue to look at all those options depending on the product. In some areas, like direct lending, I think we've seen just given where the market has evolved, the people are putting more capital now into either continuously offered products or into GPLP funds. That's great. Though we're happy with any of those choices. What do you think about new things like alternative credit or hyperscale data centers? There's probably some pretty innovative structures that we can, again, add to the mix on top of the traditional fund structures. So we'll continue to develop them all, access them all, and again, provide them all because we're trying to meet our investors where they are, not try to drive them into the structure we prefer.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: We also have, Brian, some evergreen structures on the institutional side that will continuously take in fundraising dollars every quarter.\nBrian McKenna: Got it. Helpful. Thank you, guys.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping to follow up on the dividend discussion. So can you remind us, number one, I have from my notes 100 basis points translate to about 40 million to 50 million of annual Part 1 fees. Is that still the right way to think about it? And when we're thinking about the $0.90, are you still, you made a couple references to payout ratio, but it wasn't crystal clear to me whether or not that's changing versus what you guys updated last quarter to have the payout ratio approach and be up to 100%. So is there any shift in either of those? Thanks.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thanks, Brennan. The former part is going to depend on where the SOFR curve ultimately ends up for 2025. I think the way to think about the 100 basis points move is we have a growing business in the BDC platform, right? So in 2024, we were using 100 basis points was about 40 plus million dollars. For 2025, you should look at that as 50 plus million because again, we continue to grow that platform. So depending on where the SOFR curve ultimately ends up, that will flex our payout ratio. So this may again, just be a dividend question, not necessarily an earnings question. If rates come in higher, then we'll have more capital to deploy in strategic initiatives. We'll have a lower payout ratio. If rates come in lower where the curve is currently sitting, then the payout ratio will be higher.\nBrennan Hawken: Thanks for clarifying that. And Marc, how about that game last night?\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes, that was a four, eight.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: We were in New York, a bit of a heartbreaker.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes, they lost. The Dodgers didn't win.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Yes. Yes, unfortunately, that's exactly right. And look, nothing has changed by way of how we focus on. And again, we own, the management team owns 25% of the outstanding shares. So we are very focused on, as I may have said in their prepared remarks, paying out the bulk of our earnings in dividends. That has not changed at all.\nBrennan Hawken: Perfect. Thanks for that clarity.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you. Thanks Brennan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Tabak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Tabak: Hi, good morning. So I wanted to start off with just a question on the FRE growth algorithm. Taking a step back, reflecting on the firm's journey over the past few years at the '22 Investor Day, you laid out various targets with the exception of the dividend target, you're on track to meet or exceed many of these goals. Fast forward to today and what we've been hearing on the call, a lot of focus on the increased scale of the platform, more industry verticals, greater channel breadth. I want to get a sense as to how you're thinking about the FRE growth algorithm over the next several years, whether there's any sneak peek or breadcrumbs you can offer as you're thinking through that growth roadmap ahead of the February 7th Investor Day?\nMarc Lipschultz: Let me talk about the positioning for that. And then I think Alan can fill in a bit. Look, obviously we'll get into a lot of details come February 7th and we look forward to that. I think what we're trying to make sure we convey in a very transparent fashion is look, this has been a monumentally successful chapter. And we also have a lot of conviction. We have now set the stage, the table for the next chapter to be monumentally successful. We will continue to outperform in our view, the industry, because we're positioned in the highest growth areas with a superior business model. Remember today still 91% of our revenues come from permanent capital. And all of our revenues, our fees, just pause and think about the durability and predictability of that model. And that have led to, I would say, and we're looking back multiple years now, as you said, to our last coming up on three years. And here we are on or ahead of nearly every measure through the turbulence of the last few years. I mean, how many revisions have there been in other people's numbers with Kerry and the like? And here we are just marching on 14th consecutive quarter. We intend to continue that journey. Now we'll get into the exact numbers going forward, but with our existing products that continue to have great organic opportunities, real estate, we've already 60% deployed, as you just heard, or committed, I should say, in our most recent real estate fund that's all a year old. And mind you, it's been done at spectacular terms. This last quarter in real estate, just to give you a flavor, not to digress far, in real estate, we acquired $800 million of assets with actually another 650 million of commitments to go with it at over a nine cap rate, over a nine cap rate with really strong counterparties. And simultaneously, we sold over $300 million in net lease properties at a 5.8 cap rate. So the engine that we are creating for our investors, and it's unique, distinct in triple net lease, has enormous organic growth. But then when we add to it, we add something like an IPI. And again, I don't want to do the repeat the word data centers over and over like will happen ad nauseam across all earnings calls in all industries, but rather it's the exact synergistic extension of our triple net lease business. We already are the partner of choice for corporate investment grade corporate users to say, how do I manage my real estate? And how do I do with a trusted partner? And now we have added one of the market leaders and one of the only dedicated funds for hyperscale data centers. And hyperscale data centers, you'll get their current funds, their average credit rating is AA. I mean, these are like sovereign level credits. So I think what we're doing is setting the stage to both continue organically and create these new product streams that will give us what we need to make the future, at least make the past prologue for the future. And we appreciate saying, maybe history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. And we think the next chapter is going to run pretty well.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: So I'll just add to that, Steven, and I'll be more specific with numbers. Look, generally speaking for 2024, you could see LTM 26%, FRE growth. For 2024, I think you should expect mid 20% FRE growth. I think for 2025, I mentioned earlier, I think with the first question, I think you could expect mid 20% FRE growth for 2025. Beyond that, stay tuned, of course. We'll talk a lot more about that and the next number of years on February 7th. But I will repeat what I've said in the past. We believe we can meet or exceed. We think we can continue to lead the industry in growth.\nSteven Tabak: Well said. Thanks for taking my questions. And yes, sorry about last night's debacle.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Steven.\nMarc Lipschultz: To be clear, we're very happy for our LA-based shareholders. We look out for all our stakeholders.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: New York, we're a little mourning, bud.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Crispin Love with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nCrispin Love: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With lower base rates there, this hits Part 1 fees, which you discussed and is well known. We can all do the math there. But can you discuss some of the offsets that could come with lower rates, whether to pick up and deal activity, PE activity that needs to be something as fundraising or anything else worth mentioning? And is there any way to share how you're thinking about net impacts when you take into account all that? And I understand it's a little bit of a crystal ball question here, but just curious on your thoughts broadly? Thank you.\nMarc Lipschultz: Absolutely, and a couple observations to set the stage. When we think about the comments we made today on the call, it's not taking particularly a view of net impacts, but rather what could be the adverse impacts given the volatility. Because when we think about setting a dividend, look, we're not going to know the answer to 2025 per se until the end of 2025, but we're going to set the dividend in the beginning. And so, we naturally are going to have to, or I guess we would say logically, build for the low case, whatever the variable might be, so to speak. And I don't mean the lowest possible cases in every instance. I'm not trying to be silly, but we take like rates, the low case. And yes, there are potential offsets, but we're not going to want to factor those in terms of setting expectations around our dividend. So there are offsets. Listen, when rates come down and what we have not factored in here at all is the -- and I'll call it the inescapable but unknown timing of a material increase in activity. Now remember, there's $2 trillion private equity capital that's still sitting on the sidelines and it's going to get invested. And how many, I know we've heard for quarters, everyone talking about all the green shoots, the green shoots you've never heard us say it because we didn't see them objectively. I still don't think there's evidence of a material snapback, but I know there will be a material snapback. Though there's a lot of reasons we can all hypothesize about it likely coming, probably starting in the first quarter, but you can't prove it today. And hope is not a strategy. So I think at the end of the day, from our perspective, there are absolutely offsets. A moderating rate environment or just a stabilizing environment should eventually will lead to a material pickup in PE activity. We look forward to that. That drives a lot of activity for us. And remember, there are places where that matters for us. Deployed capital is part of the calculation for us. And obviously there's the origination fee activity and there's just the demand and interest in reloading funds when people see there's a lot of attractive investment activity occurring. So yes, there are decidedly offsets which suspect will come into play in a moderated rate environment. But again, logically sitting here today, we're not trying to be so prescriptive about the exact number, but rather we are trying to make sure we have a comfortable landing spot assuming more negative relatively speaking cases than positive cases.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: And Crispin, I'll approach that from two perspectives if it's okay. Net impacts across our entire business. I think to some extent, I just talked to that when you think about the numbers I ran through kind of broad strokes. When you narrow that question, net impact to Part 1 fees. So we have, again, a growing BDC business. So we continuously take in funds. We're running at $6 to $7 billion a year of equity that we're raising in OCIC and OTIC combined. And so Part 1 fees will go up because of fundraising and deployment. We're also continuing to deploy our software lending BDC too. And so they'll go up for that reason. We suspect they'll come down for rates. And so I think you can use 4Q as kind of a diving off platform as a ballpark run rate number for 2025 as we go through the year, maybe up a little, maybe down a little, but I think that's a good kind of forecast if you will to think about where Part 1 fees can be. And then you add onto that though, potential listing of our software lending BDCs. That would create a step up, but putting that aside, I think you could use that as a base case run rate.\nCrispin Love: Great. Thank you, Marc and Alan, and appreciate all the color there.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you, Crispin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. So you closed a lot of acquisitions over the last few months. You mentioned Kuvare added a billion dollars of gross flow in 3Q. So could you give us an idea more broadly what the scale of flow from all of the deals was in 3Q? Secondly, is the 1 billion from Kuvare kind of the right quarterly run rate to be thinking about? And what could the contribution of all four deals look like in 4Q with Adelaide layering on as well? Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thank you, Patrick. I'll take this. So I may have mentioned in my prepared remarks that we were able to raise this quarter, over 20% of our fundraise this quarter was from products that were not here a year ago. So that includes insurance solutions. It includes a little bit of alternative credit, a little bit of real estate credit. It includes the GP Stakes III strip sale, some real estate Europe. So we've got a number of products in there. I think generally speaking, it's obviously going to depend on rates, but I think approaching a billion dollars or almost a billion dollars is a good benchmark to use on a go-forward basis, again, pending any sharp moves in rates.\nPatrick Davitt: And is there any sense of what Adelaide could run at quarterly now that it's in the mix?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: I think Adelaide, let's see over the next 12 months because we have a couple of things happening there. We have the raise of ASOP9, which is our flagship product for us. And then we expect to be out in the first part of next year and the first half of next year with a wealth-focused product. And that will be a continuously offered product. And so we'll see fundraising start to ramp there and hopefully grow each quarter. And then you'll have overlaying that, the more episodic flagship raise.\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes, I mean, it's really a great question because what you're getting at is we're adding more layers to our layer cake and more ways to add those layers. And so let's take Adelaide on now. They're on Fund 9 in this world of alternative credit. Again, maybe a new topic for some people. It's not new for them slash now us. And this is a great example. There was an earlier question about the cross-sell. We'll come on to the wealth opportunity, which is tremendous, but just the cross-sell of bringing together the existing capabilities of Adelaide with the distribution capabilities of Blue Owl. There are many institutions, many institutions obviously Blue Owl does business with, that Adelaide has not. And that is part of the opportunity in Fund 9, 10, 11, and as we continue. So I think you're putting your finger on it. Each one of these adds another slice to this ongoing growth opportunity set for us in assets the way you phrased it, ultimately converted into revenues and FRE where obviously our focus is.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: And one thing Marc may have mentioned in our prepared remarks was, of course we're focused on short-term and the product innovation that we're doing here. These acquisitions are really about three years from now, five years from now, seven years from now, where we can really take these businesses very similar or akin to what we did with the Oak Street triple net lease business.\nPatrick Davitt: Thank you.\nMarc Lipschultz: Thank you, Patrick, appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. So just coming back to some of the math behind some of this guidance, if you will, very loose numbers and I appreciate it. We still have a quarter to go and rates can do what they're going to do. I'm canceling out to about a 57% FRE margin inclusive of the impact of NCI. I was wanting to be just unpack, if that's right, just unpack to some of the key drivers. I think I appreciate the Part 1 fees. I'm trying to better understand the investment spending versus the proform mix of the transactions, if you will, versus just sort of this opportunity to grow across multi-vectored areas. And excuse me, is the broader takeaway here that you just more focus on the top line rather than margin and it could be a little bit more top line growth looking beyond sort of the transition of '25 to '26 at the expense of margins? Thank you.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Of course, Bill, thanks. Look, thanks for the question. So I guess let's start with this year, margins this year and I'll focus on margins similar place for the year as it is for the current quarter. The guidance we've previously given will be slightly below 60%, 59% in that ballpark. For 2025, nothing has changed there by way of guidance in the 57%, 58% ballpark. Over the longer term, we do see a path to 60%. I want to be clear, we are focused on margins. We are also focused on earnings growth. We're focused on a creative acquisitions. And so if more Adelaides [ph] come along, lower margin, accretive deals, we will do that. And so we're very focused on earnings growth overall. And I think that's part of what we've outlined a little bit, I guess, to give a taste of February 7th. But we are very focused on overall earnings growth.\nBill Katz: I'm sorry to interrupt you. Just to clarify that 57, 58, just want to make sure I'm thinking about apples, apples. Is that gross of NCI?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: It is gross of NCI, that's right. So this quarter is 59 and change, growth of NCI for the year will roughly be in the same ballpark and then 57, 58, gross of NCI for 2025.\nBill Katz: Super helpful, thank you. Sorry to interrupt you, Marc.\nMarc Lipschultz: I was just going to clarify that. Look, we're crystal clear on our job for our shareholders, which is to drive outstanding FRE growth and DE growth and deliver the bulk of that to our shareholders. And the decisions we're making, which again, if you all have, and we appreciate it, have mapped us since we've been public, we've steadily made those kinds of decisions to make sure that we are setting the stage not for, hey, what's the single best answer for a given quarter, but what is the answer to continue to lead the market? Take a step back, you know, we have come over the last -- since we went public, our management fees have compounded at 37%, our FRE revenues at 34%, and our FRE at 32%, and our dividend at just about 30%. So, I think our job is to make sure we're always, and this is what you're counting on us to do, making those sort of short-term decisions and trade-offs to develop that sort of exceptional long-term trajectory. And I think we feel really good that we're getting the pieces in place to, and I don't mean numerically continue, but this trajectory onward. And in moments that we'll choose to make investments in that, in moments that'll yield kind of excessive results. So our job is to take care of all that and make sure we continue to be a market leader on all those metrics.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Bill.\nBill Katz: Thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Thanks so much. Most of my questions were asked and answered. Maybe just one more on deployment. Marc, you talked about, you gave us some good color there on the PE market potentially coming back. Maybe just to think about that $260 million of fees that would be activated upon deployment. Any sort of view or update, I guess, on what you are viewing as the timing of that and whether that, it sounds like that might be softer initially here, just in the fourth quarter and going into one queue, or is that not correct? You take a look back right back up?\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes, deployment has been really good. I mean, you know, if you take a look at this year, we're tracking at really exceptional levels. We had our record quarter last quarter. This quarter is just about on top of our kind of strongest quarters from 2021. And that is in a very tepid M&A environment or PE M&A environment and one where the syndicated market is wide open. So I actually would take the read through, frankly, from this quarter to be extraordinarily healthy about the state of the private market and the demand for our solutions. Once we get, and again, it is a when, not an if. Once we get PE activity picking up, and if we have any moderation in the syndicated market, I mean, you're setting, we're collectively setting the stage or looking at an opportunity set for pretty meaningful optics. So you'll look at this year, it's already high and it's high in what you would probably consider the least favorable environment for volume of deployment, active syndicated market, relatively inactive PE market. So, you know, I wasn't trying to talk down the, by any measure, the offsets that will come. Characterizing offsets, future growth opportunities. Again, we're just trying to make sure when we set different targets, we take a sober view or a conservative view. But in terms of the opportunities that I had, I think we're, to be clear, very bullish about deployment. And I just, I can't tell you, I know what quarter that switch is on, right? Really got to talk to the PE folks about that, but it's going to happen. And the sooner, the more rapidly that goes to work and more rapidly that converts into fee paying assets and more rapidly our revenues and earnings grow. And it's math. Again, we are not in the vulnerable business. We're not in the, you know, carry realization business. We're in the manage for fees business and our march will go on. So when the drummer picks up the beat with PE activity, we'll march faster.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Brian.\nBrian Bedell: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Hey guys, sorry. I appreciate the follow-up. Just to clarify, Alan, just we've got a couple of questions around. When you talk about a mid-20s FRE kind of guidance target for 2025, that's an all-in FRE dollar number, right? That is not per share. That is not net of NCI. It is inclusive of the pending deal. So IPI is included within that or no? I just want to clarify.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: It's the first thing you said. That's right. It's a dollar amount.\nAlex Blostein: Right. And all in, including the deal, IPI?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Yes.\nAlex Blostein: All right. Cool. Thanks for clarifying.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Of course. Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Marc Lipschultz for closing remarks.\nMarc Lipschultz: Well, thank you everybody. Look, we really appreciate the time and the thoughtful engagement. We're excited to have delivered our 14th consecutive quarter of growth. We are excited to look back over the last few years and deliver the kind of performance we've delivered. We are more excited about looking ahead to the next several years, which we'll all talk about in detail on February 7th, but times look good to us. We're excited to be here and we appreciate your support and happy Halloween.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with the results we reported this quarter, with continued strong trends across key metrics such as revenue and earnings growth, fundraising, and deployment. Our 14th consecutive quarter of management fee and FRE growth, our second-strongest fundraising quarter ever, coming from increasingly diverse sources and a record fundraising quarter in private wealth. Those statistics have been driven almost entirely by our organic growth, and as we start to layer in the impact of the new businesses we've brought on, we're very excited about what lies ahead. Let's go through some of our key highlights on an LTM year-over-year basis through September 30th. Management fees are up 26%, and 91% of these management fees are from permanent capital vehicles. FRE is up 27%, and DE is up 22%. As you can see on Slide 13, we raised $7.9 billion of equity in the third quarter and $24.2 billion for the last 12 months, an increase of 67% from the prior last 12-month period. I'll break down the third quarter fundraising numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised $3.1 billion. $2.4 billion was raised in our direct lending strategies, of which $1.5 billion came from our non-traded diversified BDC, OCIC, 65% more than what we raised in the third quarter of 2023. Inclusive of the October 1 close, we are nearing $14 billion raised for OCIC since inception. The remainder was raised primarily through insurance solutions and in strategic equity. In GP strategic capital, we raised $3.5 billion during the quarter, including $2.4 billion across our large cap strategies latest fund and co-invest vehicles, bringing the latest vintage to $5.3 billion. And we remain confident in our ability to achieve our $13 billion goal by the end of 2025. We also raised capital in our GP financing strategy and the new vehicle raise in connection with the strip sale that occurred during the third quarter. And in real estate, we raised $1.3 billion primarily from ORENT, insurance solutions, and early capital flows for our European net lease strategy. We are pleased with the increasing breadth of fundraising across strategies and products. Of the $7.9 billion of equity raised in the third quarter, over 20% came from strategies which did not exist or were not part of our platform a year ago. And this will continue to expand with our new business acquisitions and overall organic growth. And remember, we don't look at our fundraising dollar for dollar with others, because the dollars we are raising are much more valuable. Our assets are stiffer because we are raising mostly permanent capital. For example, during the quarter, we raised approximately $3 for every $1 that went out. And most of that $1 was distributions from our income products. Our fee rates are also much higher on average and our margins compare favorably. Taken together, the profitability on each dollar raised is substantially greater. It does not compare. On the acquisition front, Kuvare asset management closed in early July, adding $21.6 billion to AUM at close and contributing almost a billion dollars of gross inflows during the quarter. And at the end of the third quarter, Adelaide also closed, adding $10.6 billion to AUM. Pro forma for our acquisition of IPI, our AUM is approximately a quarter of a trillion dollars. As a reminder, we also have substantial embedded earnings in our business. AUM not yet paying fees with $21.7 billion as of the end of the third quarter, corresponding to over $260 million of incremental annual management fees once deployed. This number has increased from $12.6 billion this time last year, reflecting incremental assets raised and strategies that earn fees upon deployment, as well as some of the new businesses we have brought on. We also have approximately $135 million of incremental management fees that will turn on upon the listing of our remaining private technology lending BDCs over time. These two items alone would represent an increase in management fees of roughly 20%. These aspects, combined with our business model of being virtually all permanent capital and 100% FRE, just gives us a higher quality of earnings than any of our peers in the industry. Moving on to our credit platform, we had gross originations of $10.9 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $4.3 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $47 billion with nearly $18 billion of net funded deployment, a record for Blue Owl. Our credit portfolio returned 3.3% in the third quarter and 15.2% over the last 12 months. Weighted average LTVs remain in the high 30s across direct lending and in the low 30s, specifically in our software lending portfolio. For our GP strategic capital platform, total invested capital for our fifth GP states fund, including agreements in principle, are over $11.6 billion of capital with line of sight into over $3 billion of opportunities, which if all are signed would bring us well through the remaining capital available in Fund V. Performance across these funds remains strong with a net IRR of 23% for Fund III, 39% for Fund IV, and 15% for Fund V. And in real estate, our net lease pipeline continues to grow with over $22 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract eclipse. As Marc mentioned earlier, we think we could be roughly 60% committed for Fund VI by year end, reflecting the strong demand we're seeing for our net lease solution. Many of these opportunities are built-to-suit arrangements, which are very capital efficient for the Senate and where we get a premium cap rate for providing a flexible, balance sheet friendly solution to our apartments. These can take between 18 and 24 months to fully deploy the capital we've committed. And as a reminder, we charge management fees mostly on invested capital, so we will earn incremental management fees as this capital is deployed. With seeing such strong deployment opportunities, this could position us well to be out in the market with the next vintage of this strategy before the end of next year. With regards to performance, gross returns across our real estate portfolio were 3.8% for the last 12 months, comparing favorably to the broader real estate market over this time period. The net IRR across our fully realized funds has been 24% for investment grade and credit-worthy tenant risk, reflecting the favorable value creation driven by our scale and solutions-based partnerships. Finally, our real estate credit team drove approximately $1 billion of gross deployment across SMAs, Insurance Solutions, and ORENT in their first full quarter on the Blue Owl platform, highlighting the benefits of combining their experience and investment expertise with a broader pool of capital with more diverse objectives. The team has been able to capitalize on deal flow they already see, which did not have a natural home previously. Okay, let's wrap up with a few closing thoughts. We are extremely proud of our record of creating value for shareholders. Since our listing, we have delivered greater than 30% annual growth rates for management fees, FRE revenue, and FRE, and we have and will continue to focus on delivering the bulk of our earnings to shareholders as dividends. To that end, I wanted to spend a moment on our 2025 dividends. We want to provide one further update as we head into the end of this enormously successful chapter and turn our attention to our next exciting chapter, which we will be discussing in detail at our investor day on February 7th. As we think about the dividends, we are incorporating a variety of factors, but there are two specific ones we want to call out. First, we will factor in the very volatile interest rate environment we are in, and second, we will consider the tremendous growth potential in our existing and newly acquired businesses. As it relates to interest rates, we note the wide range of outcomes that could play out in 2025 as reflected in the rather dramatic movements in SOFR forward curves recently. By way of example, over the last number of months, from peak to trough, the forward SOFR curve average for 2025 declined over 130 basis points, and since that time has moved back up material. We will want to incorporate the potential for another meaningful decline in SOFR curves and its potential impact on Part 1 fees into our thinking around setting a dividend. As for future growth, we want to retain some additional capital flexibility to invest behind our new strategic additions like data centers, asset back credit, and insurance solutions, where the reception has been extremely strong. We aspire to do in these markets what we have done over the past almost 10 years in our current markets. The addressable markets are large enough and early enough to make this an ambitious, but a very real possibility. Altogether, while we guided toward a likely dividend in the mid $0.90 on our last call, we currently expect a dividend closer to $0.90 in order to reflect a wide range of outcomes in SOFR. This means our payout ratio will flex a little with the ultimate level of SOFR in 2025, since we are taking a more conservative approach to where we're setting our dividend. To the extent the curve doesn't play out this way, to the extent the curve is higher in 2025, this approach allows us additional capital flexibility around strategic growth plans. A dividend around $0.90 would reflect a near 30% annual dividend growth rate since we went public and around 25% dividend growth year-over-year. We will finalize our thinking around this and announce the full year dividend for 2025 during next quarter's earnings call. Overall, we continue to put up very strong growth across every key aspect of our business. We are raising capital and more funds from a broader set of investors across more asset classes than we ever have, and that will continue to expand with the new businesses that are just joining the platform, which are already well integrated from where we are collaborating on deal flow and moving forward with new product development. As we spoke about last quarter, we think our acquisition of Oak Street is the right blueprint for how to think about the value creation possible when these platforms join Blue Owl, roughly tripling AUM and revenues in under three years through one of the toughest periods for real estate as an asset class. It's a testament to one, the quality of the real estate team, two, the preparation and thought that goes into our M&A execution playbook, three, the integration plan we put in place for these acquisitions, and four, overall fundraising capabilities across Blue Owl. We are bringing on businesses that have achieved great success on their own and have very strong expertise in their respective fields, and we are providing the resources and platform scale that will help them reach the next level. All of this put together, we believe we can continue to lead the alternative asset management industry in all of the key growth metrics that we continue to talk about, management fees, FRE revenues, and FRE. With that, I'd like to thank everyone who has joined us on the call today. Operator, can we please open the line for questions? Thank you. Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. And you're right, this is a dividend question. It's not necessarily an earnings question with my last comments. So we obviously outlined in our prepared remarks that over the last number of months, the SOFR curve average for '25 dropped by a lot, 130, 140 basis points. That could be up to a nickel impact on our per share basis. The SOFR curve since then has obviously come back a bit, but we have to take a conservative approach to how we set our dividend because we're setting it up a full year in advance. So on previous calls, we've talked a bit about the impact of rates on our Part 1 fees, that we have a business that is to some degree sensitive to SOFR levels. And we mentioned that if rates end up higher, then we have more capital that we can allocate to strategic initiatives. We have a lower payout ratio. So that payout ratio will continue to flex. And I guess to some extent, for a minute, let's pull the lens back just to put this all in perspective. As a reminder, when we had our Investor Day back in May of 2022, we called for a 35% annualized revenue growth through the end of 2025. We'll end up posting, let's say low 30% growth for that timeframe. So we're about 10% off and the dividend about 10% off. When you look at our low 30% annual growth compared to our peers growth over the same time period, we're about 2 to 2.5 times the average of our peers. And so, the focus on the dividend certainly we think has overshadowed to some extent an extraordinary growth story here that will continue now to your point into 2025 and frankly, well beyond based on the recent acquisitions we've done. So we certainly think it's working. We'll have our Investor Day on February 7th. We're super excited to come out and talk about what we think we can do well beyond 2025. But if you just focus on 2025 for a minute, we think we'll continue to put up when you think about management fees, FRE revenue, FRE, similar growth rates in '25 is what we think we're going to post in 2024. So on an LTM basis, we're about 30% revenue growth right now. We are mid 20s or so, little over that in FRE. We think we can produce similar results, let's say upper 20s or more percent growth for revenues and next year and FRE, mid to upper 20s percent growth. Of course. Thank you, Alex. Thank you, Glenn. We also have, Brian, some evergreen structures on the institutional side that will continuously take in fundraising dollars every quarter. Sure. Thanks, Brennan. The former part is going to depend on where the SOFR curve ultimately ends up for 2025. I think the way to think about the 100 basis points move is we have a growing business in the BDC platform, right? So in 2024, we were using 100 basis points was about 40 plus million dollars. For 2025, you should look at that as 50 plus million because again, we continue to grow that platform. So depending on where the SOFR curve ultimately ends up, that will flex our payout ratio. So this may again, just be a dividend question, not necessarily an earnings question. If rates come in higher, then we'll have more capital to deploy in strategic initiatives. We'll have a lower payout ratio. If rates come in lower where the curve is currently sitting, then the payout ratio will be higher. We were in New York, a bit of a heartbreaker. Yes. Yes, unfortunately, that's exactly right. And look, nothing has changed by way of how we focus on. And again, we own, the management team owns 25% of the outstanding shares. So we are very focused on, as I may have said in their prepared remarks, paying out the bulk of our earnings in dividends. That has not changed at all. Thank you. Thanks Brennan. So I'll just add to that, Steven, and I'll be more specific with numbers. Look, generally speaking for 2024, you could see LTM 26%, FRE growth. For 2024, I think you should expect mid 20% FRE growth. I think for 2025, I mentioned earlier, I think with the first question, I think you could expect mid 20% FRE growth for 2025. Beyond that, stay tuned, of course. We'll talk a lot more about that and the next number of years on February 7th. But I will repeat what I've said in the past. We believe we can meet or exceed. We think we can continue to lead the industry in growth. Thanks, Steven. New York, we're a little mourning, bud. And Crispin, I'll approach that from two perspectives if it's okay. Net impacts across our entire business. I think to some extent, I just talked to that when you think about the numbers I ran through kind of broad strokes. When you narrow that question, net impact to Part 1 fees. So we have, again, a growing BDC business. So we continuously take in funds. We're running at $6 to $7 billion a year of equity that we're raising in OCIC and OTIC combined. And so Part 1 fees will go up because of fundraising and deployment. We're also continuing to deploy our software lending BDC too. And so they'll go up for that reason. We suspect they'll come down for rates. And so I think you can use 4Q as kind of a diving off platform as a ballpark run rate number for 2025 as we go through the year, maybe up a little, maybe down a little, but I think that's a good kind of forecast if you will to think about where Part 1 fees can be. And then you add onto that though, potential listing of our software lending BDCs. That would create a step up, but putting that aside, I think you could use that as a base case run rate. Sure. Thank you, Patrick. I'll take this. So I may have mentioned in my prepared remarks that we were able to raise this quarter, over 20% of our fundraise this quarter was from products that were not here a year ago. So that includes insurance solutions. It includes a little bit of alternative credit, a little bit of real estate credit. It includes the GP Stakes III strip sale, some real estate Europe. So we've got a number of products in there. I think generally speaking, it's obviously going to depend on rates, but I think approaching a billion dollars or almost a billion dollars is a good benchmark to use on a go-forward basis, again, pending any sharp moves in rates. I think Adelaide, let's see over the next 12 months because we have a couple of things happening there. We have the raise of ASOP9, which is our flagship product for us. And then we expect to be out in the first part of next year and the first half of next year with a wealth-focused product. And that will be a continuously offered product. And so we'll see fundraising start to ramp there and hopefully grow each quarter. And then you'll have overlaying that, the more episodic flagship raise. And one thing Marc may have mentioned in our prepared remarks was, of course we're focused on short-term and the product innovation that we're doing here. These acquisitions are really about three years from now, five years from now, seven years from now, where we can really take these businesses very similar or akin to what we did with the Oak Street triple net lease business. Of course, Bill, thanks. Look, thanks for the question. So I guess let's start with this year, margins this year and I'll focus on margins similar place for the year as it is for the current quarter. The guidance we've previously given will be slightly below 60%, 59% in that ballpark. For 2025, nothing has changed there by way of guidance in the 57%, 58% ballpark. Over the longer term, we do see a path to 60%. I want to be clear, we are focused on margins. We are also focused on earnings growth. We're focused on a creative acquisitions. And so if more Adelaides [ph] come along, lower margin, accretive deals, we will do that. And so we're very focused on earnings growth overall. And I think that's part of what we've outlined a little bit, I guess, to give a taste of February 7th. But we are very focused on overall earnings growth. It is gross of NCI, that's right. So this quarter is 59 and change, growth of NCI for the year will roughly be in the same ballpark and then 57, 58, gross of NCI for 2025. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Brian. It's the first thing you said. That's right. It's a dollar amount. Yes. Of course. Thank you, Alex. Thank you everyone."

            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Great, thank you so much, Ann. During the third quarter, Blue Owl continued to generate extremely strong growth while making significant progress on our strategic M&A goals, further diversifying our business and positioning us well to participate in the transformational shifts happening within the financial markets. Over the last 12 months, we've grown management fees by 26%, fee-related earnings by 27%, and distributable earnings by 22%, all compared to the prior year period. Looking back further, we have grown management fees by nearly 200% and FRE by over 150% in just three and a half years, representing 14 consecutive quarters of growth in these metrics. We've achieved these impressive results through inflationary periods, geopolitical events, rate volatility, and a significant slowdown in capital markets, highlighting the stability and strength of our business and the durability of our earnings. And the vast majority of this growth has been organic, driven by a handful of factors which we think make Blue Owl's business model very distinct. One, we have extremely high levels of permanent capital, meaning few assets lead the system. For many of our products, there is zero redemption, so every incremental dollar of assets raised contributes to our earnings layer cake. Two, our earnings are essentially all management fee-driven, so we don't experience the same type of volatility or uncertainty that many others see during periods of market transition, as we've observed. Three, our business is geared towards the largest secular trends within the alternative asset market. These include the growth of direct lending, the increasing importance of alternatives in the wealth channel, a growing number of investment-grade companies looking for bespoke capital solutions like net lease, and the rising capital needs of alternative asset managers themselves. And this is intentional positioning. It has been by design that we chose to be in these markets, because this is where we saw the greatest divergence in the demand and supply of capital, and observed meaningful shifts in how certain markets are financed. On its own, I believe our organic growth has been quite impressive, particularly given market conditions these past few years. However, as many of you know, strategic M&A has been a key component of our strategy since we started our business. And in the past year, we have made select and modest sized acquisitions to supplement Blue Owl's core growth. These have been focused on specific areas of the market where we anticipate meaningful capital needs and strong investor interest. In other words, we are further positioning ourselves to be on the forefront of trends that will define the alternatives industry in the coming decade. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced an acquisition of IPI's business, reflecting a significant step forward in Blue Owl's presence in the digital infrastructure ecosystem. There is massive demand for data centers and very low vacancy, catalyzed by data storage needs and the proliferation of generative AI tools. IPI is one of the most scaled data center developers, owners, and operators in the world, owning roughly 4% of the world's hyperscale capacity. Their tenants include some of the largest hyperscalers and AI companies globally. We're talking about excellent counterparties, on average rated AA, and the capital investment of these enterprises is expected to measure in the trillions of dollars over the next several years. There is a huge demand, supply imbalance in this market, which relates to both the scale capital needed to fund the new development, as well as the expertise required to successfully source, develop, and operate these properties. Taking together, this dynamic creates a very high barrier-to-entry and is one of the reasons we are so enthused about this acquisition. There are a lot of companies talking about being in the data center space today, but there are very few that actually have the skill set, proven record, and deep relationships to do what IPI does, and that's why they're decidedly a leader in the market. Within the context of Blue Owl, IPI will be very complimentary to what we have in place today. Our current net lease business has a much wider mandate across multiple types of real estate, while IPI is a pure play on digital infrastructure, and one of the few managers out there that offers funds solely focused on data centers. We anticipate numerous synergies in bringing them on board, considering the firm's strong relationships with the hyperscaler community, modest investor overlap between Blue Owl and IPI, and an opportunity to create very interesting and differentiated products for the wealth distributed market, where Blue Owl has built a very strong franchise with CIC, TIC, and ORENT. This acquisition, like others we've announced, was a proprietary discussion centered around the benefits and synergies of joining Blue Owl. We think our M&A strategy is something between buy and build, a hybrid model where we are bringing on teams who excel at what they do and are scaled in their market. In joining Blue Owl, they can access incremental resources and distribution platforms that supplement and accelerate strong growth that already exists. Most of the employees on these teams see basically no change in their day-to-day, but the platform level, the synergies can be very impactful. There are numerous similarities between IPI and Atalaya, which closed during the third quarter. Atalaya's deep expertise in asset-backed finance, combined with their almost 20-year track record through market cycles, complements Blue Owl's direct lending business nicely, and we're thrilled that they are officially a part of Blue Owl. We see both digital infrastructure and alternative credit as multi-trillion-dollar markets with transformational shifts happening in real time. Through these acquisitions, we have established an expanded foothold in these areas, and similar to Oak Street, we believe we can drive multiplicative growth over time. Collectively, these new additions have been modest, with initial consideration of roughly $2.5 billion for all the transactions announced in 2024, or less than 10% of our market count. So in the early days, none of these businesses will be highly impactful to our revenues or earnings on their own, because they're just not that big. But over the next three, five, seven years, we look forward to demonstrating and quantifying the significant value creation that we are already seeing in some ways across the platform. Just to give a couple of early data points around this, our real estate credit team has already identified and created deal flow for the liquid portion of ORENT's portfolio and for our insurance solutions platform, which closed in July. Similarly, Atalaya and our credit teams have been active in sourcing investment-grade flow, and across Blue Owl, we have tripled the pipeline of private alpha and beta plus opportunities for insurance. Separately, we are hard at work on a commingled real estate credit product that should launch later this year or early next year, and our teams began driving towards this goal prior to Prima's closing. When it comes to integration, we start work streams very early, before our deals are even announced, and by closing, these businesses are largely integrated into Blue Owl, as demonstrated by the examples I just highlighted. Moving on to the quarter, we had our second highest quarter fundraising with $7.9 billion of equity capital raised and $12 billion, including debt, private wealth fundraising constituted $4.2 billion, a record quarter for this channel, driven by our perpetually distributed and fundraised for GP stakes. Gross inflows into our perpetually distributed products were $2.5 billion in the third quarter and $9.3 billion over the last 12 months, or 67% higher than the prior 12-month period. We continue to make strong inroads in this vast and growing market for alternatives and wealth, supported by our incumbency and strong relationships in this market. The level of trust that we have built with distributors through our thoughtful partnership and high-touch service continues to bear fruit. And just this quarter, we formally launched The Nest at wealth.blueowl.com to further that engagement. The Nest features educational content, portfolio construction resources, and more to guide advisors and their clients in their journey to learn about alternative markets. We'll also have an exciting conversation with platforms regarding new product development in areas such as alternative credit and digital infrastructure. Our partners continue to look to Blue Owl for differentiated products with attractive and downside-protected income objectives and thought leadership. This is true during strong markets, but particularly true during times of uncertainty. We raised $3.6 billion from institutional investors, from a number of strategies across the platform, complementing our robust flows in private wealth and reflecting the ongoing diversification of fundraising across our platform. In total, we have raised over $38 billion organically across equity and debt over the past 12 months. That's equivalent to approximately 25% of our AUM a year ago that we've raised in 12 months, and that is prior to contributions we anticipate from Atalaya, IPI, and new products we plan to have in market in the coming quarters. Turning to business performance. In credit, we had another robust quarter of deployment with nearly $11 billion of gross originations and net deployments were roughly 40% of that, resulting in a last 12-month net deployment pace of nearly $18 billion, up nearly 140% year-over-year during a period where broadly syndicated markets were very active. Direct lending metrics remain strong. On average, underlying revenue growth and EBITDA growth was high single digits across the portfolio with no significant step-ups in non-accruals or amendment requests. In alternative credit, we have experienced strong demand for the capital solutions we offer and recently announced an agreement for certain Blue Owl, formerly Atalaya Funds, to purchase up to $2 billion of loans from Upstart over the next 18 months. We've always highlighted the advantage of having scale in these markets in which we participate, and this is a great example of how Atalaya's team has brought diverse and long data pools of capital together to transact in size in one of their core markets. In GP stakes, we continue to position ourselves around two substantial secular trends, growing allocations to alternatives and GP consolidation. Collectively, our partner managers now manage over $2.1 trillion, providing us with a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the industry. We continue to see the big getting bigger, and we continue to see scaled managers increasingly selected as the partners of choice by allocators. Since the end of the second quarter, we've also completed two strip sales of assets in GP Stakes Fund 3 for what is expected to be roughly 15% of the fund's interests, providing liquidity for investors, while bringing in a new set of investors to Blue Owl. We've seen the number of allocators interested in GP Stakes continue to expand, and these transactions represent a creative way to offer access to our pool of notable partner managers while affirming Blue Owl's leading position in the space. In real estate, we continue to actively deploy capital and net lease at very attractive cap rates behind our four major themes, digital infrastructure, on-shoring, healthcare real estate, and essential retail. The capital needs in each of these areas remains very significant, and we continue to expect we'll be approximately 60% committed for Fund VI by year-end after just completing fundraising in the first quarter of this year. We are now underway on our new net lease Europe strategy and are on track to be at or above our $1 billion target by the first quarter of 2025. To bring it all together, there is clearly a lot more to the Blue Owl story today than there was last year, but the big picture has not changed. We continue to focus on finding areas with significant capital needs, like data centers and alternative credit, and we are raising large pools of long-dated capital to address those needs. We now have scaled platforms to address the institutional, private wealth, and insurance markets, and we continue to add new and differentiated products with the same underlying characteristics of income generation and downside protection. For our shareholders, the proposition remains simple. Our revenues come from durable permanent capital with best-in-class fee rates, and our earnings are made up entirely of fee-related earnings, which are coming from increasingly diversified sources. We think this makes our business quite unique and compelling, and well-positioned for continued strong and stable growth. With that, let me turn it to Alan to discuss our financial results. Yes, thank you very much. And really a critical question on a critical topic. When we take a look at over the last year, and frankly, last several years, as we've been very intentional about filling in product opportunities with two attributes, one most importantly, where we can deliver an exceptional risk adjusted return for the investors because of this match of supply and demand of capital. And importantly, where we can then also innovate product and product structure, so that as Blue Owl, we can continue our extremely strong growth rates. And so you're absolutely correct in putting your finger on what we can now do with things like alternative credit and with hyperscale data centers. So let me tease that out a little more. In both instances, and frankly, in all instances where we've acquired businesses, if you sort of think about this world of organic or inorganic growth, buy or build, what we've really landed on very intentionally is a hybrid strategy, maybe in the three bears, it's the just right strategy. And it's about how to take a absolute best of breed capability team and marry that together with the Blue Owl platform and be able to infuse superior or enhanced origination capabilities, enhanced operational support, and very importantly, to your point, product innovation. So lots of people are going to use the words alternative credit on their calls and their meetings, and lots of people are going to use the word data centers on their calls and in their meetings. But what does it take to really thrive in the business? What it takes is, again, outstanding skills, married with the right kind of innovation and platform. And I think that's exactly what we're offering. And that's why Adelaide chose to come to us and say, hey, we want to be a part of Blue Owl. That's why Iconic and Iron Point said, we want to join with the Blue Owl platform in order to be able to build our business further. These are proprietary deals done on an incredibly attractive basis. Consider that an IPI we're buying it at 13 times. These are businesses that others are buying for twice that level. And the problem with the opportunity that presents for us is to now take what is a 10 billion AUM business and to grow it at a really high rate like we did with Oak Street. So consider Oak Street, we had 10 billion of assets. We've now tripled the assets and tripled the revenues in that business. We see very similar opportunity sets in those two businesses. And you mentioned product innovation. With regard to product innovation, the wealth channel where we have developed such a strong set of partnerships and where we are the number one growth and net originator of wealth product, depending on how you measure it, one or two, we've really built a partnership of trust by bringing the right products in the right way to the wealth channel. And this is a really important point I'd emphasize. Not every product belongs in a continuously offered product form. Not everybody will successfully support products in the wealth channel. The attributes that count are durability. You want a strong income component. So if you think about alternative credit and you think about hyperscale data centers, our specialty with IPI, they are perfect matches for the wealth channel. So we see very, very significant growth ahead in those businesses. It's why Ivan and his team wanted to join us on old credit. It's why Matt, his team wanted to join us in hyperscale data centers because these people are the best in the business. And now we will bring them to new investor sets and expand the funnel of originations for them. Yes. And collectively and ourselves included put, I don't want to say excess emphasis on wealth because it's a monumentally important and distinctive capability we have. But institutional growth has been incredibly important and absolutely made clear. Cross-selling has become very much a part of our business. And actually one of, again, the opportunities, you look at the overlap between our LP base, for example, and IPI's LP base, very limited. And in fact, they bring some incredible, very large pools of capital that we've not historically done business with. And so I think cross-selling is very much a part of that synergy that we all talk about. Again, what we don't want to do ever is disrupt the world-class investment capabilities and processes these firms already have. And that's part of, again, this sort of buy-build model. What we do want to do is enhance origination and enhance distribution. And you're absolutely correct. The institutional cross-sell is just as important. Doug Ostrover has been circling the globe talking to institutions. And the interest in these products when married to Blue Owl is a big part of the upside story. Remember, take a firm like Adelaide, which has been doing alternative credit for 20 years. Let me repeat that, 20 years. Everybody is going to talk about, hey, I'm going to get into alternative credit, partly because motivated by, hey, I want to have all solutions for all people. We don't want to have all solutions for all people. We want to have outstanding solutions in every area we participate in, and particularly in a series of products that are about downside protection, capital preservation, durability, often with an income component. We know who we are, and what we're going to do is not have every product, but we are going to have the best products. And Adelaide is the best in the business at alternative credit. And why would someone want to start and invest in someone's organic undertaking in a business where you have someone with 20 years of experience, they have data on 100 million different consumers. You need that data if you're going to do alternative credit successfully. You need the data analytics to come with decades of work. IPI, lots of people would love to build a data center for one of the hyperscalers, but the hyperscalers aren't going to build it with most people. They're going to build it with the people they know and trust. And the people that have, in the case of IPI, we have Stack, our captive operational team, that's 800 people that are experts in power management and conditioning, cooling, redundancy systems, siting, development, all of which are the skills that the Microsofts of the world and their peers need and count on. That's what they're paying for. They're not interested in someone saying, oh, I could do it for you too. So I think we've got to get down to bringing not every product. That's a different strategy. There are many firms are going all things to all people. What I think we can tell you is when we bring a strategy forward, it's going to be addressing a distinctive mismatch in capital. And we are going to be built to deliver best of breed results for our investors. And that will lead to best of breed growth for Blue Owl, institutional and wealth alike. Yes, look, it obviously remains a central theme, of course, for us and for our investors, institutional and wealth alike. Again, we'll, which as you correctly just commented on wealth, it continues to be an incredible engine. We've continued to, in fact, we've had our record quarter in wealth and aggregate across all our products. We continue to develop very strong interest across platforms and within platforms for our direct lending product and very low redemption, so that's in a really, really healthy place. With regard to the sort of a prospect for growth in total, look, private BDCs, absolutely a continued option, depending on the exact strategy and how we want to build it as are GPLP funds, to your good point. Look, we've never wanted the structure to be either the impediment or the definition of what we do, what we want to do and have done is deliver the best results in credit. Remember, we've done $100 billion of loan originations and at a seven basis point running loss rate and delivered spectacular yields for our investors. What we want to make sure is that any investor that wants to participate in that has the on-ramp to do so, and the on-ramp doesn't define their result. Remember, we share every loan we have between any one of the relevant vehicles we develop and we have far fewer vehicles. So an investor in our program in any on-ramp is going to experience our best of breed results. And that's really important to us and should be really important to the investors, individuals and institutions alike. So if people want to come to us through a GPLP structure, we're very happy to do that. We do it with SMAs for some bespoke cases. We've clearly done it, as you said, with private BDCs that can then either be private or can become public BDCs. So we'll continue to develop innovate on-ramps to be able to access in the way that is best suited to the investor. So I think you can expect us to continue to look at all those options depending on the product. In some areas, like direct lending, I think we've seen just given where the market has evolved, the people are putting more capital now into either continuously offered products or into GPLP funds. That's great. Though we're happy with any of those choices. What do you think about new things like alternative credit or hyperscale data centers? There's probably some pretty innovative structures that we can, again, add to the mix on top of the traditional fund structures. So we'll continue to develop them all, access them all, and again, provide them all because we're trying to meet our investors where they are, not try to drive them into the structure we prefer. Thank you, Brian. Yes, that was a four, eight. Let me talk about the positioning for that. And then I think Alan can fill in a bit. Look, obviously we'll get into a lot of details come February 7th and we look forward to that. I think what we're trying to make sure we convey in a very transparent fashion is look, this has been a monumentally successful chapter. And we also have a lot of conviction. We have now set the stage, the table for the next chapter to be monumentally successful. We will continue to outperform in our view, the industry, because we're positioned in the highest growth areas with a superior business model. Remember today still 91% of our revenues come from permanent capital. And all of our revenues, our fees, just pause and think about the durability and predictability of that model. And that have led to, I would say, and we're looking back multiple years now, as you said, to our last coming up on three years. And here we are on or ahead of nearly every measure through the turbulence of the last few years. I mean, how many revisions have there been in other people's numbers with Kerry and the like? And here we are just marching on 14th consecutive quarter. We intend to continue that journey. Now we'll get into the exact numbers going forward, but with our existing products that continue to have great organic opportunities, real estate, we've already 60% deployed, as you just heard, or committed, I should say, in our most recent real estate fund that's all a year old. And mind you, it's been done at spectacular terms. This last quarter in real estate, just to give you a flavor, not to digress far, in real estate, we acquired $800 million of assets with actually another 650 million of commitments to go with it at over a nine cap rate, over a nine cap rate with really strong counterparties. And simultaneously, we sold over $300 million in net lease properties at a 5.8 cap rate. So the engine that we are creating for our investors, and it's unique, distinct in triple net lease, has enormous organic growth. But then when we add to it, we add something like an IPI. And again, I don't want to do the repeat the word data centers over and over like will happen ad nauseam across all earnings calls in all industries, but rather it's the exact synergistic extension of our triple net lease business. We already are the partner of choice for corporate investment grade corporate users to say, how do I manage my real estate? And how do I do with a trusted partner? And now we have added one of the market leaders and one of the only dedicated funds for hyperscale data centers. And hyperscale data centers, you'll get their current funds, their average credit rating is AA. I mean, these are like sovereign level credits. So I think what we're doing is setting the stage to both continue organically and create these new product streams that will give us what we need to make the future, at least make the past prologue for the future. And we appreciate saying, maybe history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. And we think the next chapter is going to run pretty well. To be clear, we're very happy for our LA-based shareholders. We look out for all our stakeholders. Thank you. Absolutely, and a couple observations to set the stage. When we think about the comments we made today on the call, it's not taking particularly a view of net impacts, but rather what could be the adverse impacts given the volatility. Because when we think about setting a dividend, look, we're not going to know the answer to 2025 per se until the end of 2025, but we're going to set the dividend in the beginning. And so, we naturally are going to have to, or I guess we would say logically, build for the low case, whatever the variable might be, so to speak. And I don't mean the lowest possible cases in every instance. I'm not trying to be silly, but we take like rates, the low case. And yes, there are potential offsets, but we're not going to want to factor those in terms of setting expectations around our dividend. So there are offsets. Listen, when rates come down and what we have not factored in here at all is the -- and I'll call it the inescapable but unknown timing of a material increase in activity. Now remember, there's $2 trillion private equity capital that's still sitting on the sidelines and it's going to get invested. And how many, I know we've heard for quarters, everyone talking about all the green shoots, the green shoots you've never heard us say it because we didn't see them objectively. I still don't think there's evidence of a material snapback, but I know there will be a material snapback. Though there's a lot of reasons we can all hypothesize about it likely coming, probably starting in the first quarter, but you can't prove it today. And hope is not a strategy. So I think at the end of the day, from our perspective, there are absolutely offsets. A moderating rate environment or just a stabilizing environment should eventually will lead to a material pickup in PE activity. We look forward to that. That drives a lot of activity for us. And remember, there are places where that matters for us. Deployed capital is part of the calculation for us. And obviously there's the origination fee activity and there's just the demand and interest in reloading funds when people see there's a lot of attractive investment activity occurring. So yes, there are decidedly offsets which suspect will come into play in a moderated rate environment. But again, logically sitting here today, we're not trying to be so prescriptive about the exact number, but rather we are trying to make sure we have a comfortable landing spot assuming more negative relatively speaking cases than positive cases. Thank you, Crispin. Yes, I mean, it's really a great question because what you're getting at is we're adding more layers to our layer cake and more ways to add those layers. And so let's take Adelaide on now. They're on Fund 9 in this world of alternative credit. Again, maybe a new topic for some people. It's not new for them slash now us. And this is a great example. There was an earlier question about the cross-sell. We'll come on to the wealth opportunity, which is tremendous, but just the cross-sell of bringing together the existing capabilities of Adelaide with the distribution capabilities of Blue Owl. There are many institutions, many institutions obviously Blue Owl does business with, that Adelaide has not. And that is part of the opportunity in Fund 9, 10, 11, and as we continue. So I think you're putting your finger on it. Each one of these adds another slice to this ongoing growth opportunity set for us in assets the way you phrased it, ultimately converted into revenues and FRE where obviously our focus is. Thank you, Patrick, appreciate it. I was just going to clarify that. Look, we're crystal clear on our job for our shareholders, which is to drive outstanding FRE growth and DE growth and deliver the bulk of that to our shareholders. And the decisions we're making, which again, if you all have, and we appreciate it, have mapped us since we've been public, we've steadily made those kinds of decisions to make sure that we are setting the stage not for, hey, what's the single best answer for a given quarter, but what is the answer to continue to lead the market? Take a step back, you know, we have come over the last -- since we went public, our management fees have compounded at 37%, our FRE revenues at 34%, and our FRE at 32%, and our dividend at just about 30%. So, I think our job is to make sure we're always, and this is what you're counting on us to do, making those sort of short-term decisions and trade-offs to develop that sort of exceptional long-term trajectory. And I think we feel really good that we're getting the pieces in place to, and I don't mean numerically continue, but this trajectory onward. And in moments that we'll choose to make investments in that, in moments that'll yield kind of excessive results. So our job is to take care of all that and make sure we continue to be a market leader on all those metrics. Yes, deployment has been really good. I mean, you know, if you take a look at this year, we're tracking at really exceptional levels. We had our record quarter last quarter. This quarter is just about on top of our kind of strongest quarters from 2021. And that is in a very tepid M&A environment or PE M&A environment and one where the syndicated market is wide open. So I actually would take the read through, frankly, from this quarter to be extraordinarily healthy about the state of the private market and the demand for our solutions. Once we get, and again, it is a when, not an if. Once we get PE activity picking up, and if we have any moderation in the syndicated market, I mean, you're setting, we're collectively setting the stage or looking at an opportunity set for pretty meaningful optics. So you'll look at this year, it's already high and it's high in what you would probably consider the least favorable environment for volume of deployment, active syndicated market, relatively inactive PE market. So, you know, I wasn't trying to talk down the, by any measure, the offsets that will come. Characterizing offsets, future growth opportunities. Again, we're just trying to make sure when we set different targets, we take a sober view or a conservative view. But in terms of the opportunities that I had, I think we're, to be clear, very bullish about deployment. And I just, I can't tell you, I know what quarter that switch is on, right? Really got to talk to the PE folks about that, but it's going to happen. And the sooner, the more rapidly that goes to work and more rapidly that converts into fee paying assets and more rapidly our revenues and earnings grow. And it's math. Again, we are not in the vulnerable business. We're not in the, you know, carry realization business. We're in the manage for fees business and our march will go on. So when the drummer picks up the beat with PE activity, we'll march faster. Well, thank you everybody. Look, we really appreciate the time and the thoughtful engagement. We're excited to have delivered our 14th consecutive quarter of growth. We are excited to look back over the last few years and deliver the kind of performance we've delivered. We are more excited about looking ahead to the next several years, which we'll all talk about in detail on February 7th, but times look good to us. We're excited to be here and we appreciate your support and happy Halloween."

I would like to advise the participants, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ann Dai, Head of Investor Relations for Blue Owl.\nAnn Dai: Thanks, operator, and good morning to everyone. Joining me today are Marc Lipschultz, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company's control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in Blue Owl Capital's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. We'd also like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website at blueowl.com. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blue Owl fund. This morning, we issued our financial results for the second quarter of 2024 recording fee-related earnings or FRE of $0.21 per share and distributable earnings or DE of $0.19 per share. We also declared a dividend of $0.18 per share for the second quarter payable on August 30 to holders of record as of August 21. During the call today, we'll be referring to the earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning. So please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thank you very much, Ann. Blue Owl had a very active second quarter reporting another record quarter of earnings and announcing highly strategic acquisitions that further diversify our business. Over the last 12 months, we have generated 23% fee-related earnings growth and 19% distributable earnings growth from the prior year period. And since becoming a public company, we have had 13 consecutive quarters of management fee and FRE growth, highlighting both the stability and strength of our business. Our disciplined investment approach and compelling track record have appealed to a growing pool of investors looking for uncorrelated and income-driven returns. We continue to expand the types of financing solutions we offer making us an increasingly important counterparty and in conjunction, we continue to expand the range of strategies and product options we offer to our investors. Recently, we announced our intention to acquire one of the leading alternative credit managers in the market today, Atalaya Capital Management, added substantial scale to Blue Owl's alternative credit capabilities and complementing our leading position in direct lending. Atalaya brings deep expertise in asset-based finance with a strong 18-year record through market cycles, and we believe our counterparties and clients will be very excited about the platform synergy opportunities we will be able to create with the Atalaya team on board. Alternative credit is a multitrillion-dollar market where legacy participants are pulling back, and we think we have exactly the right team in place to become an increasingly significant player in the space. Looking back to when we announced the Oak Street acquisition in 2021. Oak Street's AUM was roughly $12 billion. About 2.5 years later, we have more than $28 billion of AUM in triple net lease alone and I think this is a great case study for what we hope to achieve with Atalaya. Alan will talk more about this in a few minutes. More broadly, we now have added critical capabilities in alternative credit and real estate credit, further building out the waterfront of solutions we offer. Both are deeply disrupted markets with huge addressable opportunity sets. And with the acquisition of Kuvare Asset Management, we now offer a holistic asset management solution to insurance companies, broadening our potential investor base substantially. We expect integration of these businesses to go very smooth, given that there is generally very little overlap between Blue Owl's existing footprint and that of the businesses we are acquiring. The vast majority of the employees will see very little change in their day-to-day, with investment teams remaining focused on their areas of expertise and continuing to be led by their founders or existing senior management teams. Our goal is to enhance what each firm is already doing well and create incremental opportunities for the combined entity. And critically, all of these were proprietary acquisitions not done through auctions. The leaders of these firms or the insurance partner in the case of Kuvare wanted to grow their businesses as a part of Blue Owl. They're not selling to Blue Owl but rather joining Blue Owl. We plan to leverage Blue Owl's scale to benefit each of these businesses through our 700-plus sponsor relationships, our leading wealth distribution platform, a global and growing institutional platform, and greater efficiency and best-in-class corporate infrastructure. We're very excited about the collaborations we can create across the Blue Owl platform and look forward to sharing more about those in the quarters to come. Moving on to the quarter. We continue to see good fundraising progress across the business. Gross flows into our perpetually distributed products reached $2.8 billion in the second quarter, over 30% higher than the first quarter and more than double what we raised in the second quarter of 2023. Notably, redemptions in the perpetually offered products remain nominal despite upticks across the industry, totaling less than $325 million across all or under 20 basis points of our beginning AUM. That means we raised 9x more than what's left the system in these products. Total gross loans from private wealth were $3.2 billion. Our incumbency position as one of the leaders in the private wealth channel as a result of the relationships and the level of trust we have built with distributors through thoughtful partnership, strong performance and high-touch service at every level of these organizations. What's remarkable about the opportunity in private wealth is the overall very modest amount of allocation to alternative products, which is in the low to mid-single digit percentages. We think we're in the very early innings of the adoption of all (indiscernible) individual investors as they begin to see the benefits of diversification and uncorrelated asset classes in their portfolios. We also raised $2.2 billion from institutional investors across a number of strategies, including GP stakes, first-lien lending, liquid credit, diversified lending, and GP lending secondary\u2019s complementing our robust flows in private wealth and reflecting the ongoing diversification of fundraising across our business. To zoom out slightly, we have raised $32 billion across equity and debt over the past 12 months in an environment that most continue to describe as challenging. That's equivalent to over 20% of our AUM a year ago that we've raised in 12 months, a more than solid showing in our view, and we continue to bring new capabilities to market. Turning to business performance. In credit, we had a record quarter of deployment with more than $18.7 billion of gross originations primarily across new deals, add-ons, and refinancings where we decided to participate in the new law. Repayments were $6.9 billion, resulting in a higher quarter of net deployment. We continue to demonstrate that borrowers are drawn to the 3Ps of direct lending: predictability, privacy, and partnership and that value proposition is compelling, whether the syndicated markets are active or not. The longer-term secular trend of sponsors gravitating more and more towards direct lending remains in place, and we see healthy sponsor appetite to deploy incremental capital and monetize existing investments over time. Direct lending metrics remain strong. On average, underlying revenue growth was in the high single digits and EBITDA growth was in the mid-teens across the portfolio with no significant step-ups in nonaccruals or requests. As we think about the key to our success in direct lending, it is a very straightforward formula we follow. One, start by limiting loan losses through rigorous underwriting and been highly selective. This is evident in our seven basis points of annualized realized losses since inception. And two, when there is a default to everything we can to ensure a higher recovery. I think we have demonstrated both of these tenants very successfully over the prior years. And more broadly, our portfolio companies continue to perform extremely well. We are pleased with what we're seeing across the business. In our GP stakes business, our partner managers continue to benefit from two meaningful secular trends, growing allocations to alternatives and GP consolidation. Collectively, our partner managers now manage over $1.8 trillion, giving us an unparalleled view over the alternative asset management industry. The ongoing diversification and scale in the alt managers, the emergence and rapid growth of asset classes such as direct lending and alternative credit, the partnerships being formed in insurance asset management solutions and the expansion of opportunity in private wealth. These are all trends readily observable across our partner managers and one for which Blue Owl's business is well-positioned. This past quarter, we have also observed an uptick in asset sales for some of the partner manager portfolios, which could reflect sponsors greater willingness to monetize assets in older vintage PE funds. During the second quarter, we made our first investment for our mid-cap GP stake strategy and have two additional investments agreed to, in principle, which we expect to close in the third quarter. As for our large-cap GP stake strategy, we remain on track to have Fund V substantially committed by the third or fourth quarter of this year. We closed on an additional $1 billion for the latest vintage of the strategy during the second quarter and anticipate that fundraising in the third quarter could be similar based on current visibility but keep in mind, we're not focused on the timing of closes quarter-to-quarter. What is important is that we remain very focused and confident in our ability to achieve our $13 billion goal over the next 18 months. In real estate, we continue to actively deploy capital at attractive cap rates behind our four major themes: digital infrastructure, on shoring, health care real estate and essential retail. The capital needs in each of these areas is very significant, and we are making good progress in deploying Fund VI, which we just finished fundraise in during the last quarter. We believe we'll be approximately 60% committed for this fund by year-end, which would put us ahead of expectations in deploying capital, demonstrating the strong demand for our net lease solutions. Earlier, we spoke about the disruptive dynamics in alternative credit and real estate credit. The same dynamic applies to triple net lease, where we think we're seeing some of the very best risk reward this space has seen in a very long time. We are buying great properties at cap rates in the mid-to high 7s, facing generally investment-grade tenants and there are very few others doing what we do. That's a compelling proposition, and we are leaning into it. We continue to see nice step functions upward in the fundraising for ORENT. Second quarter flows were 130% higher than a year ago, bucking the trends seen across competitor nontraded REIT products, and we continue to launch on additional distribution platforms. To bring it all together, there's a lot of growth happening across Blue Owl organically and inorganically. But the big picture is very simple. We're an alternative asset manager with leading positions in our direct lending, GP stakes and triple net lease strategies. We have a leading position in private wealth distribution and an expanding global presence in institutional and insurance markets. We're adding scale, alternative credit and real estate credit capabilities with teams that have generated strong track records over decades and our P&L model is very simple. Almost all of our revenue comes from durable permanent capital with best-in-class fee rates, and our earnings are made up entirely of fee-related earnings. We think this makes our business quite unique and compelling and well-positioned for strong and stable growth to come. With that, let me turn it to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Marc, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the differentiated and strong results we continue to post quarter after quarter. As Marc mentioned earlier, we have been able to achieve 13 consecutive quarters of both management fee and FRE growth due to the durability of our asset base anchored by permanent capital and strong investor demand for the strategies we offer. Let's go through some of our key highlights on an LTM year-over-year basis through June 30. Management fees are up 21% and 92% of these management fees are from permanent capital vehicles. FRE is up 23% and DE is up 19%. As you can see on Slide 12, we raised $5.4 billion of equity in the second quarter and $19.2 billion of equity for the last 12 months. I'll break down the second quarter fundraising numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised $3.4 billion, $2.4 billion was raised in our diversified and first lien lending strategies, of which $1.7 billion came from our nontraded EDC, OCIC, double what we raised in the second quarter of 2023. Inclusive of the July 1 close, we have now raised over $12 billion for OCIC since inception. The remainder was raised across software lending, liquid credit, and strategic equity. In GP strategic capital, we raised $1.3 billion across our large cap strategy and co-invest vehicles. And in real estate, we raised over $650 million, primarily in rent or perpetually offered net lease products. We're pleased with the increasing breadth of fundraising across strategies and products, which will continue to expand with our new insurance solutions offering and the Prima and Atalaya acquisition. Prima closed in June, adding approximately $11 billion to AUM and in early July, our acquisition of Kuvare Asset Management also closed, adding approximately $20 billion to AUM for the third quarter. Pro forma for Atalaya closing, which is expected to add approximately $10 billion, our AUM will be over $220 billion. As a reminder, we also have substantial embedded earnings in our business. AUM not-yet-paying fees was $15.9 billion as of the end of the second quarter, corresponding to roughly $200 million of incremental annual management fees once deployed. We also have approximately $135 million of incremental management fees that will turn on upon the listing of our remaining private BDCs over time. These two items alone would represent an increase of almost 20% and from our last 12-month FRE revenues. These aspects combined with our business model of being virtually all permanent capital and 100% FRE, just gives us a higher quality of earnings than any of our peers in the industry. Moving on to our credit platform. We had gross originations of more than $18.7 billion for the quarter, a record high and net funded deployment of $7.2 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to over $40 billion with $15.5 billion of net funded deployment. Our credit portfolio returned 3% in the second quarter and 16.4% over the last 12 months. Weighted average LTVs remain in the high 30s across direct lending and in the low 30s specifically in our software lending portfolio. For our GP strategic capital platform, total invested commitments for our fifth GP Stakes funds, including agreements in principle are over $11.5 billion of capital with line of sight into over $3 billion of opportunities, which if all our signs, we bring us through the remaining capital available in Fund V. And performance across these funds remained strong with a net IRR of 24% for Fund III, 41% for Fund IV and 12% for Fund V. And in our real estate platform, our pipeline continues to grow with nearly $10 billion of transaction volume on the letter of intent or contract to close. As Mark mentioned earlier, we think we could be roughly 60% committed to Fund VI by year-end, reflecting the strong demand we're seeing for our net lease solutions. Many of these opportunities are build-to-suit arrangements, which are very capital efficient for the tenant and where we get a premium cap rate for providing a flexible balance sheet friendly solution to our parks. These can take between 18 and 24 months to fully deploy the capital we've committed. As a reminder, we charge management fees mostly on invested capital, so we will earn incremental management fees as this capital is support. We are seeing such strong deployment opportunities, this could position us well to be out in the market with the next vintage of this strategy before the end of next year. With regards to performance, gross returns across our real estate portfolio were 2.5% for the second quarter and 6.7% for the last 12 months, comparing favorably to the broader real estate market over this time period. The net IRR across our fully realized funds has been 24% for investment-grade and credit-worthy tenant risk, reflecting the favorable value creation driven by our scale and solutions-based partnerships. Okay. Let's wrap off with a few closing thoughts. We continue to track to be in or around our dollar per share goal for 2025. We've talked about the four things, now three things that needs to happen to be on track for this goal, which are: first, accretive acquisitions, which we achieved through Kuvare, Prima and the announcement of Atalaya, so check that. Three remaining things: one, continued strong fundraising levels for OCIC, OTIC and ORENT. We continue to see strong fund raise levels coming through for these products and especially in the case of ORENT, where we have seen a step function upwards with another step-up expected in the back half of this year. So overall, on this first one, we expect we are on track. Two, a successful fund raise for our large-cap GP stake funds and we are pacing at a good level here. As we have noted previously, our expectation is this will be a little more back ended with more fund raise expected in 2025 than 2024. Overall, on the second one, we expect we are on track. And three, the listing of some of our BDCs. We completed the listing of OBDE earlier this year. We continue to deploy capital in OTF II and for the BDC that remain private, we are focused on executing on the strategy we outlined during last year's BDC Investor Day. So overall, on the third one, we expect we are on track. Bringing this all together, we feel good about being in or around our dollar per share dividend goal and reporting a very strong dividend growth rate for 2025 in the low to mid-30% range, resulting in a dividend CAGR of 30% since going public. Now let's talk a little more about our Atalaya acquisition for a moment, where we think there is a meaningful opportunity akin to what we saw for Oak Street. Marc mentioned earlier that we have more than doubled Oak Street's AUM in just under three years. So let me put some color around how we've achieved that. Since acquiring Oak Street, we have doubled the net lease team, including the addition of Jesse Holm as CIO of the platform. We have created new product offerings for the private wealth channel and are in the process of launching a European net lease product and the investments have started to pay off with ORENT out raising all of our peers on a net basis and Fund VI well exceeding its $5 billion (indiscernible). Bringing it all together, we have been able to accomplish a great deal in a relatively short amount of time in our net lease business. We have more than doubled AUM. We have almost tripled permanent capital. We have triple FRE revenues, and we have grown our average management fee rate by over 30%. And most importantly, based on the increase in FRE that we have generated in our triple net lease platform we have created almost $1 billion of additional value for our shareholders in just a few years in a very tough environment to raise real estate funds. We are equally excited about our Atalaya acquisition. The Atalaya team is one of, if not the best, in the alternative credit industry, and we have a lot of runway ahead of us to grow this business together. We have mentioned that this acquisition is modestly accretive in 2025 and we think much more accretive as we really ramp this business over the next number of years, similar to Oak Street. It is, however, margin dilutive for Blue Owl. As we continue to do acquisitions, we won't always find businesses with the same FRE margins. The margins here are well below our levels. We believe we can increase them over time, but may not ultimately get up to 60% with each of our acquisitions. That's okay. We expect this deal will be very value accretive for us over time and fills a very strategic product area for us in a huge industry growth area. So as we go into the next year or so, we can see margins for the remainder of this year being slightly below the 60% level and for 2025 being 2% to 3% lower. On a last note, we have led the alternative asset management industry and growth since we listed in 2021, and we have every intention on continuing to lead the industry for the foreseeable future and the key metrics that matter to all of us management fees, FRE revenues, FRE and dividend growth; and we feel very confident we will accomplish these goals through continued organic and inorganic growth and reinvestment back into our business. With that, I'd like to thank everyone who has joined us on the call today. Operator, can we please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: So first question maybe on the deployment opportunities in private credit and direct lending, very big step up in the quarter on gross originations and net as well and that's obviously despite a fairly high level of syndicated market activity as well as higher refi volumes across the industry. So maybe talk a little bit about how broad-based was the deployment you saw this quarter. Anything in particularly kind of lumpy that you would call out? And I guess how would you characterize gross and net deployment backdrop for the rest of the year?\nMarc Lipschultz: Thanks, Alex. Look, it's a great environment for direct lending. And actually think this quarter is very revealing about the power of the model. Given this is also a time where the syndicated market is as open as it's ever been, and PE activity remains actually, I think, by our collective measure tepid relative to the dry powder. That's the backdrop. And yet, as noted, it was by far our biggest origination quarter. And I take those three together, and I would actually say, yes, that is meaningful, which is to say, no, there are not sort of special onetime items, if you will, in the ultimate net originations number. There's a lot of broad activity. We thankfully have a combination of add-ons which, of course, are proprietary. People that are assets that are being sold and were the incumbent, and that often gives pretty proprietary angle on things. And then, of course, just new investments and we are, I think, well-positioned to continue to do very well in that marketplace. So I look at this quarter as a pretty strong indicator going forward and every quarter will vary based on indeed the exact volume, what we choose to do. But I think what we can read from this is the continued demand for direct lending by users of capital is extremely strong even when the syndicated market is widely available. And I think that's actually a really meaningful data point because people have always sort of overread this idea that all it's when the market's close, then direct lending is a solution. I think what we're seeing is the extreme durability of having long-term capital to provide long-term solutions and deliver the 3Ps: predictability, privacy, and partnership, to the users of the capital. The part that I think gets us excited, and again, I'm not trying to time the moment this happens. But starting from what we just said, there are a few things going on. One, as I just said, there is the relatively tepid PE activity. That will pick up. There's a huge amount of dry powder as we all know. It will get deployed. And we can read from this quarter that whether the syndicated market is wide open or not, direct lending gets a big piece of that. Well, at some point, either we're going to have a less active syndicated market, that's escapable at some point, given the relative strength today. And we're going to have a more active PE market. So combine that with what we're seeing in this environment, that's a very robust outlook from our point of view. And I want to add one more cherry to that, a slight moderation in interest rates, which seems to be forthcoming, will be good. I mean, really good for continued accelerated interest by people and doing financings and doing deals. So, yes, we're feeling like it's a pretty good moment. Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Mckenna with Citizens JMP.\nBrian Mckenna: Okay. Great. Thanks. So just a question on all the recent M&A you've done. Strategically, all these deals make sense and round out the capabilities across the firm. But how should we think about the incremental growth from these deals relative to the legacy Blue Owl growth rate? It would seem like the revenue opportunities for all of these are quite a bit better than their legacy historical growth rates similar to the outcome with Oak Street. So I'm just trying to figure out if these deals will ultimately be accreted to the termite growth rate of Blue Owl over time?\nMarc Lipschultz: So the acquisitions, of course, you observed, have been really important parts of our strategy. And I think it's important to make two core observations before we get into the sort of specifics of the actual underlying businesses. The acquisitions in the context of Blue Owl are really people not selling to us but joining us. And we said -- I said this in my remarks a moment ago, but it's really important framework when you think about what Blue Owl is doing. What we have done before and are continuing to do is say, look, where there are best-of-breed investment capabilities and there's a great fit between that organization and ours and those leaders and our leadership group then we can make overly use one plus one equal -- I'm not going to use three, I think it's four and five. We're going to really try to combine not change the world-class investment capabilities, but be able to bring our infrastructure and kind of, if you will, the origination synergies, the intellectual capital synergies between the businesses and it works. Look at Oak Street. Oak Street, at the time we announced it had $12 billion of AUM, today, $28 billion of AUM and we have dramatically increased the amount of permanent capital. We have created the wealth product. We've had a record -- the largest real estate fund ever completed last year was in our product suite. So I think we've seen that we know how to bring these world-class capabilities together with the Blue Owl platform, and that's a winner for our LPs and a winner for our shareholders. So that's sort of, I think, key observation -- well, two observations really, which is joining, not selling. We are buying things in an auction and someone exits, they join us. We are so fortunate to have Marc Zahr, you can see it in the leadership of the firm and in the leadership of real estate. You -- we now have Ivan Zinn in joining us, leading Atalaya. I mean he is a superstar of the world of asset-based finance and it goes on. So that's the way I would read the collection of assets. Now what does it mean for our business? And Alan, I'm sure will add to this. These are accretive acquisitions just on their face. And so we'll see the benefits of that, but they're kind of inconsequential if you will, in the scheme of the very near term, but they are critical for the long term. What we're doing now is setting the stage for the years beyond 2025. What we're doing is setting up products that have very large addressable markets where we have distinctive capabilities. That, again, distinctive capabilities is key. So we look at things like alternative credit, asset-backed credit in the next 10 years look a lot like the last 10 years did in direct lending. When we came to direct lending with this notion of, hey, listen, what we're going to do is go offer private solutions and we want to finance the best credits from the best users of capital, not lender of last resort and provide those 3Ps that people value that certainty. We're going to do the same in asset-backed credit. It's a bigger market. It's a $7 trillion market. It's only 5% penetrated by private solutions today and now Blue Owl combined with Atalaya. Atalaya, it's a great idea on Wall Street today, asset-backed, Atalaya has been doing it for nearly 20 years. 20 years with spectacular results. So now you have the Blue Owl credit platform married with one of kind of the couple of best in the world probably in this business and that gives us the legs we need for not even just next handful of years, but what we think can be the next decade version of direct lending. Prima, our leg into real estate credit. You say real estate credit, everyone thinks, oh, my gosh, look at all the problems there. Prima has been doing this business for over 30 years. They've had two losses, two losses in 32 years. So there are ways to go into each of these markets with exceptional talent and with very focused strategies that I will characterize as the boring inversions. We're very into doing boring products, products that deliver in and out, up and down through all markets and it turns out when you do that over and over and over again, that turns out to be pretty exciting. So that's where we bring Prima to the mix Prima. That's probably a $5 trillion addressable market in the case of real estate credit. So we are looking at these as critical pieces along with our insurance, now distribution. Remember, we're not getting the insurance business, but we've now created an insurance alternative management capability where we can package capabilities, no coincidence of things like Prima and asset-backed credit are perfect marriages with that delivery to the insurance channel. So all this really kind of comes together around setting the stage for what comes in the next five and 10 years for us.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Brian, to broaden that a little bit, we -- I talked in my prepared remarks about the few things left for our -- in and around $1 a share goal. And now as Marc's talking about, now everything else, all the things we've talked about this year so far on the road when we're meeting with our investors are all growth initiatives beyond 2025. How do we keep this industry-leading growth level well, well beyond this in and around $1 a share goal? So you sprinkle in these acquisitions, very targeted focused acquisitions. We're going to continue to grow inorganically, but then you layer in the organic growth to talk about our credit products, our evergreen diversified lending strategy, our evergreen first lien fund strategy, our health care vertical, our GP-led secondary product. And then you add in some real estate products or European triple net lease, which is getting really good traction are growing our real estate finance products and potentially gearing up, as I said, by the end of next year for our real estate Fund VII. And as Marc said, Fund VI, we had a record year with where we ended up with Fund VI. And then our new mid-market GP stakes product. So when you layer in the organic and inorganic growth. This is what we've been talking about all year. How do we really keep that industry-leading growth level well around 2025?\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So maybe another angle on the deal activity. So I agree, Oak Street seems to be textbook purchase integration and accelerated growth story. When you think about just -- you just did three deals in a reasonably short period of time, is something different in the deal environment that has brought these companies to your doorstep and why? So I want -- asking about what's going on with the deal environment? And two is history hasn't been great in asset management land for companies to buy a bunch of other companies, half leaving alone, half levered them. It usually hurt margins. And eventually, you had some grew, some didn't. It's a bad -- it leaves a bad taste in investors' mouth. I think that the underlying growth of the alternatives backdrop is significantly better than what we're looking at. My question is, how do you make sure you integrate enough that you are one firm enough that you lever the brands and the best things and don't learn -- or do learn from the mistakes of the past -- of the traditional asset managers.\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. So these coming together in this form, I think mostly we ought to look at as just a reflection of the right opportunity at the right time. These are businesses that came to us. These are one-off as we noted. So this is really about finding strong partnerships and I think that does start to address this question of how do you get the best of both worlds. This is us working in tandem with the leadership team of Prima, working in tandem with the leadership team of Atalaya continuing in our partnership with Kuvare remaining in the insurance business and remaining a strategic partner to us, we're providing asset management services. So I think the key for us here is, these are one-off opportunities that are about joining us, and we assess that not just on, is it a good strategy and is it a world-class team at investing, but is it a tremendous fit for our firm? And I can tell you the cultural assessment we go through when we think about something like a Prima or Atalaya is as important as the financial assessment. And I can tell you, by the way, it\u2019s (indiscernible). These are great people and they are very much a part of the Blue Owl, as we talked about, everyone is going to wear the Blue Owl jersey and that is how we work. This is not a constellation of activities. It's absolutely one firm. That's how we operate. But what we don't change is the success of the investment strategies and that's been the model for direct lending. It's been the model for GP States. It's been the model for Oak Street. So actually, it's been done multiple times for us here, how to get the best of investment performance with the full integration of the businesses into the firm. So I have to say we feel very good about the muscles we have built for that, and everything is moving along in the right direction. So I would tell you we're feeling like we understand very much the questions, the caution, if you will, that you're noting in any M&A and M&A and financial services. But in this case, Oak Street to me is a much better template to look at. In fact, because that's actually ours, actually a very analogous sized business, actually an analogous set of circumstances where the senior leadership team came and joined this firm to be a part of the leadership of Blue Owl then sell to this firm.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: I think the management fee trend in the quarter was probably a little disappointing relative to the very positive FP AUM inflow and AUM surprise. So were there any timing issues with like big deployments skewing later in the quarter that maybe aren't showing up in the full quarter? And if so, maybe to level set, do you know what the run rate for management fees would have been with the full quarter of all those, a full quarter of Prima, et cetera?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thanks, Patrick. I don't have the run rate on -- off the top of my head. I could tell you that we had some closings at the very end of the quarter, so didn't really have any time to accrete in for the quarter. And in 1Q, we had some small catch-up fees, both in real estate and in GP stakes that elevated just slightly 1Q's numbers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: We wanted to come back to Alan's margin commentary near the end of the prepared remarks. So with the 2025 FRE margin now at 57% to 58% longer term as you scale digest these mergers. Where do you see the long-term target? Is that still 60% or maybe a little higher? How should we think about that?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: [Audio Gap] potential growth numbers over the next few years, and it fits a very strategic area for us and a very big addressable market, as Marc was talking about. So let's talk for a minute about what are we creating here? When I look backwards just for a minute and I look at our management fee growth for our real estate business. On an LTM basis, since we acquired the Oak Street business, we haven't had a quarter go by where we haven't had 50% growth on an LTM basis in management fees there and overall Blue Owl, we haven't had a quarter go by, that's been less than 20%. And when you take that up to the Blue Owl FRE revenues, we haven't had a quarter go by that's been lower than 25% revenues. And so that's looking backwards, what we've created. Now looking forward, when you think about the things that we have out there, AUM not yet paying fees, GP stake 6 fundraise, the CIC and TIC fundraises over '24 and '25, and then the BDC step-ups in fees. That's another $1 billion of revenue from where we were at the end of 2023. So that's a 60% growth just from those few things, and that doesn't include all the other things that I just rattled through in a previous question about growth initiatives beyond 2025. When I think about fundraising, we think we're going to almost double our equity fund raise versus where we were last year. And so what we're doing, it's working. We're reinvesting back into our business. It's fueling industry-leading growth and it's accelerating between now and the end of 2025. So when you think about that 25% revenue number we just posted on an LTM basis, that growth, we think, will accelerate to approaching 30% growth for this year and for next year. And again, I wouldn't change the longer-term 60% FRE margin. Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So I wanted to ask a question on Part 1 fees. Just given the expectation for rate cuts on the horizon, loan spreads tightening over the last 12 months, there's some concern that Part 1 fees could come under greater pressure as the higher-yielding back book begins to roll off. Recognizing there's going to be a meaningful offset from ramping deployment activity, and certainly, the comments there were quite constructive, but I was hoping to get just a mark-to-market for where current origination yields sit today relative to the back book? And maybe just speak to the ability to defend, I guess, what would now be a high 50s FRE margin in '25 amid deeper rate cuts and spread contraction?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thanks for your question, Steven. Look, we have a BDC business that continues to grow. And so yes, as rates come down, we will see some pressure on Part 1 fees. We also see, from a number of perspectives, Part 1 fees going up. So we still have our software lending to BDC that's not fully deployed as we continue to deploy that capital. Part 1 fees are going to continue to go up vis-a-vis the prior quarter and we still have some ways to go to fully deploy that capital. We still have two BDCs, and we'll continue to have two BDCs, OCIC and OTIC, that are fundraising at very strong levels today, and we'll continue to for everything that we see on the go forward. So we will continue to see Part 1 fees stepping up quarter-over-quarter as it relates to our fundraising efforts and these continually offered products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Crispin Love with Piper Sandler.\nCrispin Love: Can you just give us an update on credit quality across the portfolio what you're seeing? Are you seeing any degradation in the portfolio? And then when you look at Pluralsight specifically, how confident are you that is a one-off in the portfolio versus the potential for other credit stress elsewhere?\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes, credit quality is very good. This is a strong environment. Our portfolio on average grew EBITDA in the teens, mid-teens. So we continue to see a very strong overall performance. We have not seen any material change in amendment requirements or requests or changes in demand for payment in kind if they were cash-paid before running down the revolvers. And look, we will always have one-off companies that have some -- their challenges, That's, of course, the nature of the beast. We fortunately, as I described, look, we have a pretty simple system in theory, very complicated in execution, which is to find through rigorous work great companies that are very likely to perform really well and the handful of times, they don't perform well, make sure we get a strong recovery. And so that actually leads us right to put overall credit quality continues to march on very, very steadily and very well. In terms of Pluralsight, look, Pluralsight, it's probably worth commenting on one thing. We care a lot about Pluralsight's performance and every credit and ultimately, every recovery. For the Blue Owl shareholder, again, let's remember, we're a fee-based business. So, really, the underlying yields of the funds are not really directly a part of the Blue Owl business. We get fees, we don't have to carry. So I just want to put that again as a flag. Now we care a tremendous amount about the performance. Also context, just let's -- for those of you who don't know. Pluralsight is an IT training business that was bought by Thoma Bravo and that we led the financing of with several other private lenders. Very sorry, Vista, apologies. It is not a software business, just to make sure we're all clear on where it lands but look, Vista is a great sponsor, made a lot of great investments, and we do a lot of business together. This one didn't work. I mean, obviously, that's disappointing to them. It's disappointing to us. It's not where we all like to be. So, at the end of the day, a small loan. It's a little over $300 million out of our almost $100 billion portfolio and now we'll end up owning it without lot of string and drag, again, it's not what Vista or we wanted to be the outcome. But actually, it's kind of a study in private lending working, which is here will be a smooth handoff I expect, and we'll carry on in supporting the management and the business and stay tuned for the next few years, and we'll find out what the exact recovery is. Do we get all our money back, do we get most of our money back? We'll all find that out together in the next few years but that's the limit of the drama. It just doesn't really matter to our business. And no, I don't think you can extrapolate anything from it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Alan, I wanted to follow-up on -- and apologies if you hit on this, my line cut out a bit during your response to the question on the margin outlook. But it seems as though the margin compression is impacted by some of the deals that you guys have recently done. And you also reiterated your confidence to be at or around the dollar dividend. And so is the bridge there better revenue growth? And can you just confirm whether or not some of the recent deals are really what's pulling down the margin have been anything beyond that would be ideal?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Yes. That's right, Brennan. Thank you for the question. The -- in particular, the Atalaya transaction has the -- Atalaya as a business has roughly half the margin that we do. We know we can grow this over time. We just don't know yet whether we can get it up to the same margin as where we are today and we're investing in these acquisitions. So as I outlined what we did with Oak Street. So we could have some slight downward momentum before it swings back up, but we feel very confident and very strong about the long-term trajectory of keeping that 60% or higher margin over time and it is driven by the acquisitions that we're making and the investment we're putting into these acquisitions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from TD Cowen.\nBill Katz: I just want to unpack the dividend a little bit further. So you affirmed the $0.72 this year and you think you can grow that in the low- to mid-30% range year-on-year, and it does sound like top-line driven. So if I take 35% as a reasonable proxy, it get about $0.97. And so as I look at the year-to-date dynamics between distributable earnings and the dividend, the payout rate has been about 100% round numbers. So I'm wondering if you could just talk about the algorithm in terms of capital allocation and the import on the dollar and is there a broader argument here to potentially move away from a dividend growth story and think about a broader capital return opportunity?\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Sure. Thank you, Bill. So that's right. We're targeting a low to mid dividend growth for 2025 versus 2024. That low to mid will put us somewhere around the $0.96. That is a -- approaching if not 100% dividend payout ratio, that's really what we've been communicating to investors, it's where we've seen this year will step up to a 90%, low 90s percent payout ratio. And then we would look to bring that back down over time as we get past 2025. So we've continued to keep our eye on that in and around the dividend in and around the $1 share dividend goal. And then over time, we'll bring that payout ratio back down a little bit. [Audio Gap]\nAnn Dai: Patrick, I think you're on for a follow-up.\nPatrick Davitt: Kuvare, just closed on July 1. Could you update us on how we should think about kind of the regular way annuity-type quarterly inflow you'll start to see from that given the kind of ongoing annuity issuance from the insurance partner there?\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. The Kuvare acquisition is a very exciting one for us, and I want to reframe importantly what we did buy and what we didn't buy. So we bought the Kuvare Asset Management business. Getting paid fees to manage assets in fashions that are packaged delivered both in terms of abilities and structures for insurance companies. We did not buy the insurance operations. We are not in the insurance business. We don't have spread-related earnings concept. We continue to have fee-related earnings. That's very important to our business model. So Kuvare remains very active in the insurance business and very successfully so. That is to say that they continue to be very successful in issuing annuities. They have been, in fact, for an insurance company their size, I think it's quite impressive what they've accomplished in terms of access, for example, to the Japanese market. In 2023, there was $5.6 billion of flows. The expected growth rate this year has been higher for them to total originations. They have had a good strong start to the year. So we continue to expect -- again, that was 2023, and we're rising from there. So this is something that will be contributing over time done the way we expect it will, billions of dollars of flows for us on an annual basis and in fact, on a quarterly basis. So we are very happy to have this additional leg to our stool, along with being one of the key leaders in wealth. Remember there, we had $3.2 billion in the wealth channel, institutional, great continued growth in institutional and access to new accounts, and now we add insurance, where we have another set of flows, started off of this base of $20 billion of assets we just took. And as you note in your question, as there are inflows, those come to us to manage. So this is yet another engine for us to continue to originate exactly what we want, which are long-dated, fee-paying assets. So the insurance addition married, as I mentioned, with these other capabilities that, by the way, not a coincidence, that's something like Prima and asset-backed lending are perfect strategies for insurance users. I think we're going to have something pretty special to offer out to the marketplace.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: I would just like to make sure I understand what -- make sure I'm putting together the pieces correctly here. It seems like what's happened is you guys have had some good deals come together and you've done several deals rather quickly. You're realizing it's going to probably take a little bit longer to get all of these pieces put together. And so we're going to see some margin compression next year. You guys still feel good about the dividend and getting to the dividend, but you're kind of getting there via the higher payout ratio. And so it's more driven by that ratio rather than the earnings growth. Do I have that right? And -- or would you course correct me in anything there?\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. Let me try to course correct a little bit, and Alan can add too. It's not that it's more complicated to integrate. It's not that it's anything unexpected, it's math. If you acquire at the time, a lower margin business, it's going to, for some short period of time, be an impact to margins until we complete as planned, the full integration and then continue to optimize across the whole integrated business. So it's -- I don't want to say anything about a change in expectations. But again, if I acquire something, which we do with a lower margin and integrate and then operationalize, will return, we expect fully to our 60% plus margin, but it will be essentially a near mathematical impossibility to buy something with a meaningful lower margin and not have it in the short term impact the margin. So no, I think it's pretty transitory, but I also would emphasize. From our point of view, and I would suggest from our investors' point of view, what you want to do is continue to encourage us and focus, we will on how do we continue to deliver very high predictable growth in FRE and dividend. And margin is -- it's obviously a measure of, obviously, the profitability, but we'd rather have more revenue and have more growth and more opportunity, whether that absolute -- what we want to do is drive absolute dollars. It happens to be the case that here, we expect this to be, yes, a short-term dilution from acquisitions and return to the 60% plus but I actually don't think that ought to particularly be the measure of success. The management success, are we substantially growing our per share absolute FRE, DE and dividend, and that's exactly what these acquisitions are augmenting for us in the short term and absolutely positioning us for the long term.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: And I'll just add to that, Brennan, the guidance of low to mid-30s dividend growth is right on top of our in and about $1 a share that we've been talking about, obviously, well before we had our eye on, frankly, any of these acquisitions. And let's just pick 96, if 96 is the number. That's -- I made this comment in my prepared remarks, it's a 30% CAGR over 4.5 years for our dividend. So we feel fantastic about that. We feel really great about it, and we feel even better about what our future trajectory looks like for growth as we talked about well beyond 2025.\nMarc Lipschultz: Okay. I don't think we have any further questions. So look, we appreciate everyone's time. It was an exceptional quarter. I mean we are really pleased with where things stand. We're pleased, most importantly, with the returns for our LPs and all of our strategies. We're extremely pleased to be here telling you, the second versus same is the first, which is we keep delivering, marching forward our 13th straight quarter of increases. We see our continuing trajectory looking very bright. With the acquisitions, we have set the stage, which, of course, we'll talk about in much more detail in the future, set the stage to continue our highly predictable and stable growth plan and our very strong steady march on FRE, DE and dividends. So we're very happy with where things stand. We think we've got very exciting opportunities had. So we look forward to keeping you all posted. And we think you'll all share our enthusiasm as you start to see us reveal the positives of what we can develop out of our continuing organic strategies and these inorganic additions.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, everyone. Enjoy the rest of the summer.\nOperator: The meeting has now concluded. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Marc, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the differentiated and strong results we continue to post quarter after quarter. As Marc mentioned earlier, we have been able to achieve 13 consecutive quarters of both management fee and FRE growth due to the durability of our asset base anchored by permanent capital and strong investor demand for the strategies we offer. Let's go through some of our key highlights on an LTM year-over-year basis through June 30. Management fees are up 21% and 92% of these management fees are from permanent capital vehicles. FRE is up 23% and DE is up 19%. As you can see on Slide 12, we raised $5.4 billion of equity in the second quarter and $19.2 billion of equity for the last 12 months. I'll break down the second quarter fundraising numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised $3.4 billion, $2.4 billion was raised in our diversified and first lien lending strategies, of which $1.7 billion came from our nontraded EDC, OCIC, double what we raised in the second quarter of 2023. Inclusive of the July 1 close, we have now raised over $12 billion for OCIC since inception. The remainder was raised across software lending, liquid credit, and strategic equity. In GP strategic capital, we raised $1.3 billion across our large cap strategy and co-invest vehicles. And in real estate, we raised over $650 million, primarily in rent or perpetually offered net lease products. We're pleased with the increasing breadth of fundraising across strategies and products, which will continue to expand with our new insurance solutions offering and the Prima and Atalaya acquisition. Prima closed in June, adding approximately $11 billion to AUM and in early July, our acquisition of Kuvare Asset Management also closed, adding approximately $20 billion to AUM for the third quarter. Pro forma for Atalaya closing, which is expected to add approximately $10 billion, our AUM will be over $220 billion. As a reminder, we also have substantial embedded earnings in our business. AUM not-yet-paying fees was $15.9 billion as of the end of the second quarter, corresponding to roughly $200 million of incremental annual management fees once deployed. We also have approximately $135 million of incremental management fees that will turn on upon the listing of our remaining private BDCs over time. These two items alone would represent an increase of almost 20% and from our last 12-month FRE revenues. These aspects combined with our business model of being virtually all permanent capital and 100% FRE, just gives us a higher quality of earnings than any of our peers in the industry. Moving on to our credit platform. We had gross originations of more than $18.7 billion for the quarter, a record high and net funded deployment of $7.2 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to over $40 billion with $15.5 billion of net funded deployment. Our credit portfolio returned 3% in the second quarter and 16.4% over the last 12 months. Weighted average LTVs remain in the high 30s across direct lending and in the low 30s specifically in our software lending portfolio. For our GP strategic capital platform, total invested commitments for our fifth GP Stakes funds, including agreements in principle are over $11.5 billion of capital with line of sight into over $3 billion of opportunities, which if all our signs, we bring us through the remaining capital available in Fund V. And performance across these funds remained strong with a net IRR of 24% for Fund III, 41% for Fund IV and 12% for Fund V. And in our real estate platform, our pipeline continues to grow with nearly $10 billion of transaction volume on the letter of intent or contract to close. As Mark mentioned earlier, we think we could be roughly 60% committed to Fund VI by year-end, reflecting the strong demand we're seeing for our net lease solutions. Many of these opportunities are build-to-suit arrangements, which are very capital efficient for the tenant and where we get a premium cap rate for providing a flexible balance sheet friendly solution to our parks. These can take between 18 and 24 months to fully deploy the capital we've committed. As a reminder, we charge management fees mostly on invested capital, so we will earn incremental management fees as this capital is support. We are seeing such strong deployment opportunities, this could position us well to be out in the market with the next vintage of this strategy before the end of next year. With regards to performance, gross returns across our real estate portfolio were 2.5% for the second quarter and 6.7% for the last 12 months, comparing favorably to the broader real estate market over this time period. The net IRR across our fully realized funds has been 24% for investment-grade and credit-worthy tenant risk, reflecting the favorable value creation driven by our scale and solutions-based partnerships. Okay. Let's wrap off with a few closing thoughts. We continue to track to be in or around our dollar per share goal for 2025. We've talked about the four things, now three things that needs to happen to be on track for this goal, which are: first, accretive acquisitions, which we achieved through Kuvare, Prima and the announcement of Atalaya, so check that. Three remaining things: one, continued strong fundraising levels for OCIC, OTIC and ORENT. We continue to see strong fund raise levels coming through for these products and especially in the case of ORENT, where we have seen a step function upwards with another step-up expected in the back half of this year. So overall, on this first one, we expect we are on track. Two, a successful fund raise for our large-cap GP stake funds and we are pacing at a good level here. As we have noted previously, our expectation is this will be a little more back ended with more fund raise expected in 2025 than 2024. Overall, on the second one, we expect we are on track. And three, the listing of some of our BDCs. We completed the listing of OBDE earlier this year. We continue to deploy capital in OTF II and for the BDC that remain private, we are focused on executing on the strategy we outlined during last year's BDC Investor Day. So overall, on the third one, we expect we are on track. Bringing this all together, we feel good about being in or around our dollar per share dividend goal and reporting a very strong dividend growth rate for 2025 in the low to mid-30% range, resulting in a dividend CAGR of 30% since going public. Now let's talk a little more about our Atalaya acquisition for a moment, where we think there is a meaningful opportunity akin to what we saw for Oak Street. Marc mentioned earlier that we have more than doubled Oak Street's AUM in just under three years. So let me put some color around how we've achieved that. Since acquiring Oak Street, we have doubled the net lease team, including the addition of Jesse Holm as CIO of the platform. We have created new product offerings for the private wealth channel and are in the process of launching a European net lease product and the investments have started to pay off with ORENT out raising all of our peers on a net basis and Fund VI well exceeding its $5 billion (indiscernible). Bringing it all together, we have been able to accomplish a great deal in a relatively short amount of time in our net lease business. We have more than doubled AUM. We have almost tripled permanent capital. We have triple FRE revenues, and we have grown our average management fee rate by over 30%. And most importantly, based on the increase in FRE that we have generated in our triple net lease platform we have created almost $1 billion of additional value for our shareholders in just a few years in a very tough environment to raise real estate funds. We are equally excited about our Atalaya acquisition. The Atalaya team is one of, if not the best, in the alternative credit industry, and we have a lot of runway ahead of us to grow this business together. We have mentioned that this acquisition is modestly accretive in 2025 and we think much more accretive as we really ramp this business over the next number of years, similar to Oak Street. It is, however, margin dilutive for Blue Owl. As we continue to do acquisitions, we won't always find businesses with the same FRE margins. The margins here are well below our levels. We believe we can increase them over time, but may not ultimately get up to 60% with each of our acquisitions. That's okay. We expect this deal will be very value accretive for us over time and fills a very strategic product area for us in a huge industry growth area. So as we go into the next year or so, we can see margins for the remainder of this year being slightly below the 60% level and for 2025 being 2% to 3% lower. On a last note, we have led the alternative asset management industry and growth since we listed in 2021, and we have every intention on continuing to lead the industry for the foreseeable future and the key metrics that matter to all of us management fees, FRE revenues, FRE and dividend growth; and we feel very confident we will accomplish these goals through continued organic and inorganic growth and reinvestment back into our business. With that, I'd like to thank everyone who has joined us on the call today. Operator, can we please open the line for questions. Brian, to broaden that a little bit, we -- I talked in my prepared remarks about the few things left for our -- in and around $1 a share goal. And now as Marc's talking about, now everything else, all the things we've talked about this year so far on the road when we're meeting with our investors are all growth initiatives beyond 2025. How do we keep this industry-leading growth level well, well beyond this in and around $1 a share goal? So you sprinkle in these acquisitions, very targeted focused acquisitions. We're going to continue to grow inorganically, but then you layer in the organic growth to talk about our credit products, our evergreen diversified lending strategy, our evergreen first lien fund strategy, our health care vertical, our GP-led secondary product. And then you add in some real estate products or European triple net lease, which is getting really good traction are growing our real estate finance products and potentially gearing up, as I said, by the end of next year for our real estate Fund VII. And as Marc said, Fund VI, we had a record year with where we ended up with Fund VI. And then our new mid-market GP stakes product. So when you layer in the organic and inorganic growth. This is what we've been talking about all year. How do we really keep that industry-leading growth level well around 2025? Thanks, Patrick. I don't have the run rate on -- off the top of my head. I could tell you that we had some closings at the very end of the quarter, so didn't really have any time to accrete in for the quarter. And in 1Q, we had some small catch-up fees, both in real estate and in GP stakes that elevated just slightly 1Q's numbers. [Audio Gap] potential growth numbers over the next few years, and it fits a very strategic area for us and a very big addressable market, as Marc was talking about. So let's talk for a minute about what are we creating here? When I look backwards just for a minute and I look at our management fee growth for our real estate business. On an LTM basis, since we acquired the Oak Street business, we haven't had a quarter go by where we haven't had 50% growth on an LTM basis in management fees there and overall Blue Owl, we haven't had a quarter go by, that's been less than 20%. And when you take that up to the Blue Owl FRE revenues, we haven't had a quarter go by that's been lower than 25% revenues. And so that's looking backwards, what we've created. Now looking forward, when you think about the things that we have out there, AUM not yet paying fees, GP stake 6 fundraise, the CIC and TIC fundraises over '24 and '25, and then the BDC step-ups in fees. That's another $1 billion of revenue from where we were at the end of 2023. So that's a 60% growth just from those few things, and that doesn't include all the other things that I just rattled through in a previous question about growth initiatives beyond 2025. When I think about fundraising, we think we're going to almost double our equity fund raise versus where we were last year. And so what we're doing, it's working. We're reinvesting back into our business. It's fueling industry-leading growth and it's accelerating between now and the end of 2025. So when you think about that 25% revenue number we just posted on an LTM basis, that growth, we think, will accelerate to approaching 30% growth for this year and for next year. And again, I wouldn't change the longer-term 60% FRE margin. Thanks, Craig. Sure. Thanks for your question, Steven. Look, we have a BDC business that continues to grow. And so yes, as rates come down, we will see some pressure on Part 1 fees. We also see, from a number of perspectives, Part 1 fees going up. So we still have our software lending to BDC that's not fully deployed as we continue to deploy that capital. Part 1 fees are going to continue to go up vis-a-vis the prior quarter and we still have some ways to go to fully deploy that capital. We still have two BDCs, and we'll continue to have two BDCs, OCIC and OTIC, that are fundraising at very strong levels today, and we'll continue to for everything that we see on the go forward. So we will continue to see Part 1 fees stepping up quarter-over-quarter as it relates to our fundraising efforts and these continually offered products. Yes. That's right, Brennan. Thank you for the question. The -- in particular, the Atalaya transaction has the -- Atalaya as a business has roughly half the margin that we do. We know we can grow this over time. We just don't know yet whether we can get it up to the same margin as where we are today and we're investing in these acquisitions. So as I outlined what we did with Oak Street. So we could have some slight downward momentum before it swings back up, but we feel very confident and very strong about the long-term trajectory of keeping that 60% or higher margin over time and it is driven by the acquisitions that we're making and the investment we're putting into these acquisitions. Sure. Thank you, Bill. So that's right. We're targeting a low to mid dividend growth for 2025 versus 2024. That low to mid will put us somewhere around the $0.96. That is a -- approaching if not 100% dividend payout ratio, that's really what we've been communicating to investors, it's where we've seen this year will step up to a 90%, low 90s percent payout ratio. And then we would look to bring that back down over time as we get past 2025. So we've continued to keep our eye on that in and around the dividend in and around the $1 share dividend goal. And then over time, we'll bring that payout ratio back down a little bit. [Audio Gap] And I'll just add to that, Brennan, the guidance of low to mid-30s dividend growth is right on top of our in and about $1 a share that we've been talking about, obviously, well before we had our eye on, frankly, any of these acquisitions. And let's just pick 96, if 96 is the number. That's -- I made this comment in my prepared remarks, it's a 30% CAGR over 4.5 years for our dividend. So we feel fantastic about that. We feel really great about it, and we feel even better about what our future trajectory looks like for growth as we talked about well beyond 2025. Thank you, everyone. Enjoy the rest of the summer."

            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Great. Thank you very much, Ann. Blue Owl had a very active second quarter reporting another record quarter of earnings and announcing highly strategic acquisitions that further diversify our business. Over the last 12 months, we have generated 23% fee-related earnings growth and 19% distributable earnings growth from the prior year period. And since becoming a public company, we have had 13 consecutive quarters of management fee and FRE growth, highlighting both the stability and strength of our business. Our disciplined investment approach and compelling track record have appealed to a growing pool of investors looking for uncorrelated and income-driven returns. We continue to expand the types of financing solutions we offer making us an increasingly important counterparty and in conjunction, we continue to expand the range of strategies and product options we offer to our investors. Recently, we announced our intention to acquire one of the leading alternative credit managers in the market today, Atalaya Capital Management, added substantial scale to Blue Owl's alternative credit capabilities and complementing our leading position in direct lending. Atalaya brings deep expertise in asset-based finance with a strong 18-year record through market cycles, and we believe our counterparties and clients will be very excited about the platform synergy opportunities we will be able to create with the Atalaya team on board. Alternative credit is a multitrillion-dollar market where legacy participants are pulling back, and we think we have exactly the right team in place to become an increasingly significant player in the space. Looking back to when we announced the Oak Street acquisition in 2021. Oak Street's AUM was roughly $12 billion. About 2.5 years later, we have more than $28 billion of AUM in triple net lease alone and I think this is a great case study for what we hope to achieve with Atalaya. Alan will talk more about this in a few minutes. More broadly, we now have added critical capabilities in alternative credit and real estate credit, further building out the waterfront of solutions we offer. Both are deeply disrupted markets with huge addressable opportunity sets. And with the acquisition of Kuvare Asset Management, we now offer a holistic asset management solution to insurance companies, broadening our potential investor base substantially. We expect integration of these businesses to go very smooth, given that there is generally very little overlap between Blue Owl's existing footprint and that of the businesses we are acquiring. The vast majority of the employees will see very little change in their day-to-day, with investment teams remaining focused on their areas of expertise and continuing to be led by their founders or existing senior management teams. Our goal is to enhance what each firm is already doing well and create incremental opportunities for the combined entity. And critically, all of these were proprietary acquisitions not done through auctions. The leaders of these firms or the insurance partner in the case of Kuvare wanted to grow their businesses as a part of Blue Owl. They're not selling to Blue Owl but rather joining Blue Owl. We plan to leverage Blue Owl's scale to benefit each of these businesses through our 700-plus sponsor relationships, our leading wealth distribution platform, a global and growing institutional platform, and greater efficiency and best-in-class corporate infrastructure. We're very excited about the collaborations we can create across the Blue Owl platform and look forward to sharing more about those in the quarters to come. Moving on to the quarter. We continue to see good fundraising progress across the business. Gross flows into our perpetually distributed products reached $2.8 billion in the second quarter, over 30% higher than the first quarter and more than double what we raised in the second quarter of 2023. Notably, redemptions in the perpetually offered products remain nominal despite upticks across the industry, totaling less than $325 million across all or under 20 basis points of our beginning AUM. That means we raised 9x more than what's left the system in these products. Total gross loans from private wealth were $3.2 billion. Our incumbency position as one of the leaders in the private wealth channel as a result of the relationships and the level of trust we have built with distributors through thoughtful partnership, strong performance and high-touch service at every level of these organizations. What's remarkable about the opportunity in private wealth is the overall very modest amount of allocation to alternative products, which is in the low to mid-single digit percentages. We think we're in the very early innings of the adoption of all (indiscernible) individual investors as they begin to see the benefits of diversification and uncorrelated asset classes in their portfolios. We also raised $2.2 billion from institutional investors across a number of strategies, including GP stakes, first-lien lending, liquid credit, diversified lending, and GP lending secondary's complementing our robust flows in private wealth and reflecting the ongoing diversification of fundraising across our business. To zoom out slightly, we have raised $32 billion across equity and debt over the past 12 months in an environment that most continue to describe as challenging. That's equivalent to over 20% of our AUM a year ago that we've raised in 12 months, a more than solid showing in our view, and we continue to bring new capabilities to market. Turning to business performance. In credit, we had a record quarter of deployment with more than $18.7 billion of gross originations primarily across new deals, add-ons, and refinancings where we decided to participate in the new law. Repayments were $6.9 billion, resulting in a higher quarter of net deployment. We continue to demonstrate that borrowers are drawn to the 3Ps of direct lending: predictability, privacy, and partnership and that value proposition is compelling, whether the syndicated markets are active or not. The longer-term secular trend of sponsors gravitating more and more towards direct lending remains in place, and we see healthy sponsor appetite to deploy incremental capital and monetize existing investments over time. Direct lending metrics remain strong. On average, underlying revenue growth was in the high single digits and EBITDA growth was in the mid-teens across the portfolio with no significant step-ups in nonaccruals or requests. As we think about the key to our success in direct lending, it is a very straightforward formula we follow. One, start by limiting loan losses through rigorous underwriting and been highly selective. This is evident in our seven basis points of annualized realized losses since inception. And two, when there is a default to everything we can to ensure a higher recovery. I think we have demonstrated both of these tenants very successfully over the prior years. And more broadly, our portfolio companies continue to perform extremely well. We are pleased with what we're seeing across the business. In our GP stakes business, our partner managers continue to benefit from two meaningful secular trends, growing allocations to alternatives and GP consolidation. Collectively, our partner managers now manage over $1.8 trillion, giving us an unparalleled view over the alternative asset management industry. The ongoing diversification and scale in the alt managers, the emergence and rapid growth of asset classes such as direct lending and alternative credit, the partnerships being formed in insurance asset management solutions and the expansion of opportunity in private wealth. These are all trends readily observable across our partner managers and one for which Blue Owl's business is well-positioned. This past quarter, we have also observed an uptick in asset sales for some of the partner manager portfolios, which could reflect sponsors greater willingness to monetize assets in older vintage PE funds. During the second quarter, we made our first investment for our mid-cap GP stake strategy and have two additional investments agreed to, in principle, which we expect to close in the third quarter. As for our large-cap GP stake strategy, we remain on track to have Fund V substantially committed by the third or fourth quarter of this year. We closed on an additional $1 billion for the latest vintage of the strategy during the second quarter and anticipate that fundraising in the third quarter could be similar based on current visibility but keep in mind, we're not focused on the timing of closes quarter-to-quarter. What is important is that we remain very focused and confident in our ability to achieve our $13 billion goal over the next 18 months. In real estate, we continue to actively deploy capital at attractive cap rates behind our four major themes: digital infrastructure, on shoring, health care real estate and essential retail. The capital needs in each of these areas is very significant, and we are making good progress in deploying Fund VI, which we just finished fundraise in during the last quarter. We believe we'll be approximately 60% committed for this fund by year-end, which would put us ahead of expectations in deploying capital, demonstrating the strong demand for our net lease solutions. Earlier, we spoke about the disruptive dynamics in alternative credit and real estate credit. The same dynamic applies to triple net lease, where we think we're seeing some of the very best risk reward this space has seen in a very long time. We are buying great properties at cap rates in the mid-to high 7s, facing generally investment-grade tenants and there are very few others doing what we do. That's a compelling proposition, and we are leaning into it. We continue to see nice step functions upward in the fundraising for ORENT. Second quarter flows were 130% higher than a year ago, bucking the trends seen across competitor nontraded REIT products, and we continue to launch on additional distribution platforms. To bring it all together, there's a lot of growth happening across Blue Owl organically and inorganically. But the big picture is very simple. We're an alternative asset manager with leading positions in our direct lending, GP stakes and triple net lease strategies. We have a leading position in private wealth distribution and an expanding global presence in institutional and insurance markets. We're adding scale, alternative credit and real estate credit capabilities with teams that have generated strong track records over decades and our P&L model is very simple. Almost all of our revenue comes from durable permanent capital with best-in-class fee rates, and our earnings are made up entirely of fee-related earnings. We think this makes our business quite unique and compelling and well-positioned for strong and stable growth to come. With that, let me turn it to Alan to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Alex. Look, it's a great environment for direct lending. And actually think this quarter is very revealing about the power of the model. Given this is also a time where the syndicated market is as open as it's ever been, and PE activity remains actually, I think, by our collective measure tepid relative to the dry powder. That's the backdrop. And yet, as noted, it was by far our biggest origination quarter. And I take those three together, and I would actually say, yes, that is meaningful, which is to say, no, there are not sort of special onetime items, if you will, in the ultimate net originations number. There's a lot of broad activity. We thankfully have a combination of add-ons which, of course, are proprietary. People that are assets that are being sold and were the incumbent, and that often gives pretty proprietary angle on things. And then, of course, just new investments and we are, I think, well-positioned to continue to do very well in that marketplace. So I look at this quarter as a pretty strong indicator going forward and every quarter will vary based on indeed the exact volume, what we choose to do. But I think what we can read from this is the continued demand for direct lending by users of capital is extremely strong even when the syndicated market is widely available. And I think that's actually a really meaningful data point because people have always sort of overread this idea that all it's when the market's close, then direct lending is a solution. I think what we're seeing is the extreme durability of having long-term capital to provide long-term solutions and deliver the 3Ps: predictability, privacy, and partnership, to the users of the capital. The part that I think gets us excited, and again, I'm not trying to time the moment this happens. But starting from what we just said, there are a few things going on. One, as I just said, there is the relatively tepid PE activity. That will pick up. There's a huge amount of dry powder as we all know. It will get deployed. And we can read from this quarter that whether the syndicated market is wide open or not, direct lending gets a big piece of that. Well, at some point, either we're going to have a less active syndicated market, that's escapable at some point, given the relative strength today. And we're going to have a more active PE market. So combine that with what we're seeing in this environment, that's a very robust outlook from our point of view. And I want to add one more cherry to that, a slight moderation in interest rates, which seems to be forthcoming, will be good. I mean, really good for continued accelerated interest by people and doing financings and doing deals. So, yes, we're feeling like it's a pretty good moment. Thanks, Alex. So the acquisitions, of course, you observed, have been really important parts of our strategy. And I think it's important to make two core observations before we get into the sort of specifics of the actual underlying businesses. The acquisitions in the context of Blue Owl are really people not selling to us but joining us. And we said -- I said this in my remarks a moment ago, but it's really important framework when you think about what Blue Owl is doing. What we have done before and are continuing to do is say, look, where there are best-of-breed investment capabilities and there's a great fit between that organization and ours and those leaders and our leadership group then we can make overly use one plus one equal -- I'm not going to use three, I think it's four and five. We're going to really try to combine not change the world-class investment capabilities, but be able to bring our infrastructure and kind of, if you will, the origination synergies, the intellectual capital synergies between the businesses and it works. Look at Oak Street. Oak Street, at the time we announced it had $12 billion of AUM, today, $28 billion of AUM and we have dramatically increased the amount of permanent capital. We have created the wealth product. We've had a record -- the largest real estate fund ever completed last year was in our product suite. So I think we've seen that we know how to bring these world-class capabilities together with the Blue Owl platform, and that's a winner for our LPs and a winner for our shareholders. So that's sort of, I think, key observation -- well, two observations really, which is joining, not selling. We are buying things in an auction and someone exits, they join us. We are so fortunate to have Marc Zahr, you can see it in the leadership of the firm and in the leadership of real estate. You -- we now have Ivan Zinn in joining us, leading Atalaya. I mean he is a superstar of the world of asset-based finance and it goes on. So that's the way I would read the collection of assets. Now what does it mean for our business? And Alan, I'm sure will add to this. These are accretive acquisitions just on their face. And so we'll see the benefits of that, but they're kind of inconsequential if you will, in the scheme of the very near term, but they are critical for the long term. What we're doing now is setting the stage for the years beyond 2025. What we're doing is setting up products that have very large addressable markets where we have distinctive capabilities. That, again, distinctive capabilities is key. So we look at things like alternative credit, asset-backed credit in the next 10 years look a lot like the last 10 years did in direct lending. When we came to direct lending with this notion of, hey, listen, what we're going to do is go offer private solutions and we want to finance the best credits from the best users of capital, not lender of last resort and provide those 3Ps that people value that certainty. We're going to do the same in asset-backed credit. It's a bigger market. It's a $7 trillion market. It's only 5% penetrated by private solutions today and now Blue Owl combined with Atalaya. Atalaya, it's a great idea on Wall Street today, asset-backed, Atalaya has been doing it for nearly 20 years. 20 years with spectacular results. So now you have the Blue Owl credit platform married with one of kind of the couple of best in the world probably in this business and that gives us the legs we need for not even just next handful of years, but what we think can be the next decade version of direct lending. Prima, our leg into real estate credit. You say real estate credit, everyone thinks, oh, my gosh, look at all the problems there. Prima has been doing this business for over 30 years. They've had two losses, two losses in 32 years. So there are ways to go into each of these markets with exceptional talent and with very focused strategies that I will characterize as the boring inversions. We're very into doing boring products, products that deliver in and out, up and down through all markets and it turns out when you do that over and over and over again, that turns out to be pretty exciting. So that's where we bring Prima to the mix Prima. That's probably a $5 trillion addressable market in the case of real estate credit. So we are looking at these as critical pieces along with our insurance, now distribution. Remember, we're not getting the insurance business, but we've now created an insurance alternative management capability where we can package capabilities, no coincidence of things like Prima and asset-backed credit are perfect marriages with that delivery to the insurance channel. So all this really kind of comes together around setting the stage for what comes in the next five and 10 years for us. Sure. So these coming together in this form, I think mostly we ought to look at as just a reflection of the right opportunity at the right time. These are businesses that came to us. These are one-off as we noted. So this is really about finding strong partnerships and I think that does start to address this question of how do you get the best of both worlds. This is us working in tandem with the leadership team of Prima, working in tandem with the leadership team of Atalaya continuing in our partnership with Kuvare remaining in the insurance business and remaining a strategic partner to us, we're providing asset management services. So I think the key for us here is, these are one-off opportunities that are about joining us, and we assess that not just on, is it a good strategy and is it a world-class team at investing, but is it a tremendous fit for our firm? And I can tell you the cultural assessment we go through when we think about something like a Prima or Atalaya is as important as the financial assessment. And I can tell you, by the way, it's (indiscernible). These are great people and they are very much a part of the Blue Owl, as we talked about, everyone is going to wear the Blue Owl jersey and that is how we work. This is not a constellation of activities. It's absolutely one firm. That's how we operate. But what we don't change is the success of the investment strategies and that's been the model for direct lending. It's been the model for GP States. It's been the model for Oak Street. So actually, it's been done multiple times for us here, how to get the best of investment performance with the full integration of the businesses into the firm. So I have to say we feel very good about the muscles we have built for that, and everything is moving along in the right direction. So I would tell you we're feeling like we understand very much the questions, the caution, if you will, that you're noting in any M&A and M&A and financial services. But in this case, Oak Street to me is a much better template to look at. In fact, because that's actually ours, actually a very analogous sized business, actually an analogous set of circumstances where the senior leadership team came and joined this firm to be a part of the leadership of Blue Owl then sell to this firm. Yes, credit quality is very good. This is a strong environment. Our portfolio on average grew EBITDA in the teens, mid-teens. So we continue to see a very strong overall performance. We have not seen any material change in amendment requirements or requests or changes in demand for payment in kind if they were cash-paid before running down the revolvers. And look, we will always have one-off companies that have some -- their challenges, That's, of course, the nature of the beast. We fortunately, as I described, look, we have a pretty simple system in theory, very complicated in execution, which is to find through rigorous work great companies that are very likely to perform really well and the handful of times, they don't perform well, make sure we get a strong recovery. And so that actually leads us right to put overall credit quality continues to march on very, very steadily and very well. In terms of Pluralsight, look, Pluralsight, it's probably worth commenting on one thing. We care a lot about Pluralsight's performance and every credit and ultimately, every recovery. For the Blue Owl shareholder, again, let's remember, we're a fee-based business. So, really, the underlying yields of the funds are not really directly a part of the Blue Owl business. We get fees, we don't have to carry. So I just want to put that again as a flag. Now we care a tremendous amount about the performance. Also context, just let's -- for those of you who don't know. Pluralsight is an IT training business that was bought by Thoma Bravo and that we led the financing of with several other private lenders. Very sorry, Vista, apologies. It is not a software business, just to make sure we're all clear on where it lands but look, Vista is a great sponsor, made a lot of great investments, and we do a lot of business together. This one didn't work. I mean, obviously, that's disappointing to them. It's disappointing to us. It's not where we all like to be. So, at the end of the day, a small loan. It's a little over $300 million out of our almost $100 billion portfolio and now we'll end up owning it without lot of string and drag, again, it's not what Vista or we wanted to be the outcome. But actually, it's kind of a study in private lending working, which is here will be a smooth handoff I expect, and we'll carry on in supporting the management and the business and stay tuned for the next few years, and we'll find out what the exact recovery is. Do we get all our money back, do we get most of our money back? We'll all find that out together in the next few years but that's the limit of the drama. It just doesn't really matter to our business. And no, I don't think you can extrapolate anything from it. Yes. The Kuvare acquisition is a very exciting one for us, and I want to reframe importantly what we did buy and what we didn't buy. So we bought the Kuvare Asset Management business. Getting paid fees to manage assets in fashions that are packaged delivered both in terms of abilities and structures for insurance companies. We did not buy the insurance operations. We are not in the insurance business. We don't have spread-related earnings concept. We continue to have fee-related earnings. That's very important to our business model. So Kuvare remains very active in the insurance business and very successfully so. That is to say that they continue to be very successful in issuing annuities. They have been, in fact, for an insurance company their size, I think it's quite impressive what they've accomplished in terms of access, for example, to the Japanese market. In 2023, there was $5.6 billion of flows. The expected growth rate this year has been higher for them to total originations. They have had a good strong start to the year. So we continue to expect -- again, that was 2023, and we're rising from there. So this is something that will be contributing over time done the way we expect it will, billions of dollars of flows for us on an annual basis and in fact, on a quarterly basis. So we are very happy to have this additional leg to our stool, along with being one of the key leaders in wealth. Remember there, we had $3.2 billion in the wealth channel, institutional, great continued growth in institutional and access to new accounts, and now we add insurance, where we have another set of flows, started off of this base of $20 billion of assets we just took. And as you note in your question, as there are inflows, those come to us to manage. So this is yet another engine for us to continue to originate exactly what we want, which are long-dated, fee-paying assets. So the insurance addition married, as I mentioned, with these other capabilities that, by the way, not a coincidence, that's something like Prima and asset-backed lending are perfect strategies for insurance users. I think we're going to have something pretty special to offer out to the marketplace. Yes. Let me try to course correct a little bit, and Alan can add too. It's not that it's more complicated to integrate. It's not that it's anything unexpected, it's math. If you acquire at the time, a lower margin business, it's going to, for some short period of time, be an impact to margins until we complete as planned, the full integration and then continue to optimize across the whole integrated business. So it's -- I don't want to say anything about a change in expectations. But again, if I acquire something, which we do with a lower margin and integrate and then operationalize, will return, we expect fully to our 60% plus margin, but it will be essentially a near mathematical impossibility to buy something with a meaningful lower margin and not have it in the short term impact the margin. So no, I think it's pretty transitory, but I also would emphasize. From our point of view, and I would suggest from our investors' point of view, what you want to do is continue to encourage us and focus, we will on how do we continue to deliver very high predictable growth in FRE and dividend. And margin is -- it's obviously a measure of, obviously, the profitability, but we'd rather have more revenue and have more growth and more opportunity, whether that absolute -- what we want to do is drive absolute dollars. It happens to be the case that here, we expect this to be, yes, a short-term dilution from acquisitions and return to the 60% plus but I actually don't think that ought to particularly be the measure of success. The management success, are we substantially growing our per share absolute FRE, DE and dividend, and that's exactly what these acquisitions are augmenting for us in the short term and absolutely positioning us for the long term. Okay. I don't think we have any further questions. So look, we appreciate everyone's time. It was an exceptional quarter. I mean we are really pleased with where things stand. We're pleased, most importantly, with the returns for our LPs and all of our strategies. We're extremely pleased to be here telling you, the second versus same is the first, which is we keep delivering, marching forward our 13th straight quarter of increases. We see our continuing trajectory looking very bright. With the acquisitions, we have set the stage, which, of course, we'll talk about in much more detail in the future, set the stage to continue our highly predictable and stable growth plan and our very strong steady march on FRE, DE and dividends. So we're very happy with where things stand. We think we've got very exciting opportunities had. So we look forward to keeping you all posted. And we think you'll all share our enthusiasm as you start to see us reveal the positives of what we can develop out of our continuing organic strategies and these inorganic additions."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Blue Owl Capital's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. During the presentation, your lines will remain on listen-only mode. Later on we will have a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to advise all parties that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Anne Dai, Head of Investor Relations for Blue Owl. Please go ahead.\nAnn Dai: Thanks, operator, and good morning to everyone. Joining me today are Marc Lipschultz, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Alan Kirshenbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind our listeners that remarks made during the call may contain forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside the company's control. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in Blue Owl's capital filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. We'd also like to remind everyone that we'll refer to non-GAAP measures on the call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, available on the Investor Resources section of our website at blueowl.com. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blue Owl fund. This morning, we issued our financial results for the first quarter of 2024, reporting fee-related earnings, or FRE of $0.20 per share; and distributable earnings, or DE, of $0.17 per share. We also declared a dividend of $0.18 per share for the first quarter payable on May 30 to holders of record as of May 21. During the call today, we'll be referring to the earnings presentation, which we posted to our website this morning. So please have that on hand to follow along. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to March.\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thank you very much, Ann. We reported another strong quarter of results for Blue Owl this morning with 12 straight quarters in consecutive management fee and FRE growth since we've been a public company. We're very pleased with the predictable, consistent and robust growth we've been able to generate for our shareholders across a range of market backdrops, reflecting the benefits of our FRE-centric and permanent capital heavy business model. Said plainly, our earnings consists almost entirely of management fees, so we're not subject to the volatility and uncertainty of revenues tied to realized gains and capital markets activity. And having long-duration capital means that very little use of our system, providing us with a resilient asset base that grows faster than our peer group for the same number of dollars rates. We think the market is starting to understand and appreciate the value of these stabilized attributes and how they contribute to our premium growth profile. On a 12-month year-over-year basis, we grew FRE revenue and FRE by 24% and DE by 20%. We're humbled to be among the leaders in these metrics across our whole peer group that includes very accomplished firms in our industry and it's something we don't take lightly as we continue to plant the seeds for future growth at Blue Owl. Globally, demand for differentiated income-driven returns remains very strong, and we continue to see good interest in our credit, GP's strategic capital and real estate strategies across institutional and wealth investors. During the quarter, we held the final close on our latest triple net lease fund, bringing in nearly $500 million. We raised $5.2 billion total after receiving approval to exceed our hard cap of $5 billion. This fund was the largest U.S. focused real estate fund in 2023 and more than doubled the size of its predecessor fund, demonstrating significant investor demand despite a very challenging backdrop for real estate fun raise in general. In the wealth channel, gross flows into our perpetually distributed products reached $2.1 billion in the first quarter, 16% higher than the fourth quarter and almost double what we raised in the first quarter of 2023. And in April alone, we've raised close to $1 billion in those perpetual products. We also closed on $1.4 billion of institutional capital in our direct lending business, across separate accounts and closes for our first lien lending and strategic equity strategies, complementing to continued growth in wealth. And our new mid-cap GP strategic capital strategy is off to a very good start with over $0.5 billion raised during the first quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced 2 acquisitions that further expand our suite of investment offerings and broaden the markets to which we provide capital solutions. First, we made a preferred investment into Kuvare and announced our intention to acquire Kuvare Asset Management, reflecting a creative and accretive way to broaden Blue Owl's value proposition to the insurance space. The Global Life and annuity market is over $20 trillion in size and an increase in number of insurance companies are looking to partner with specialized asset managers that can create better risk-adjusted returns through differentiated sourcing, underwriting and structuring. By adding a set of more IG-focused credit and real estate capabilities to Blue Owl's existing and scaled origination platforms, we can bring a more comprehensive insurance asset management solution in the marketplace. We will also benefit from Kuvare as we expect they will continue to take market share in an expanding annuities market. Acquiring Kuvare Asset Management adds $20 billion of AUM or but not inclusive of incremental growth at Kuvare. I think we approached this acquisition in a very Blue Owl way, meaning we came from a mindset of providing solutions to not competing with our clients. We had no desire to become balance sheet heavy or to become an insurance company. Instead, we plan to partner with them and allow them to continue to do what they do best, underwriting liabilities, while we focus on what we do best at managing assets. This solution's mentality is in keeping with what you see across the rest of our business. In direct lending, for instance, we provide financing solutions to sponsors for their portfolio companies. In GP stakes, we provide capital to the sponsors themselves. We prefer to help them grow their businesses as opposed to competing with them in those businesses. Now turning back to M&A. The second transaction we announced recently was our intention to acquire Prima Capital, an investment manager focused on real estate lending with approximately $10 billion of assets under management. Structurally, we see an increasing need for capital to finance real estate and have been interested in expanding our capabilities in this area. Prima struck us as a great fit for Blue Owl given its leading position, high-quality portfolio and strong historical track record through cycles, and we expect to leverage Blue Owl's scale and expertise to accelerate expansion. Pro forma for these 2 transactions, Blue Owl AUM would exceed $200 billion, crossing another meaningful milestone. Now moving on to business performance. In credit, we saw a fairly constructive environment for deployment with elevated repayment activity. As a reminder, the return of syndicated market activity reflects greater market participant confidence, which, over time, will enable increasing M&A activity. We've proven we can deploy significant capital when syndicated markets are active, and we believe we're well positioned to do it again. Knowing the outsized market share the direct lenders have seen over the past 1.5 years, the longer-term secular trend has been one in which sponsors have increasingly gravitated towards direct lenders for the value proposition they offer, and we see this trend continue. We see healthy sponsor appetite to deploy incremental dry powder and monetize existing investments over time and we expect Blue Owl to play a meaningful role in new capital deployment and refinancings. As Alan will detail, direct lending metrics remained strong. We have had just 7 basis points annualized realized loss, which has largely been offset by realized gains. And the underlying revenue and EBITDA growth of the portfolio remains in the low double digits on average. High level, our observation is that the economy is sound and rates are likely to be higher for one. While we would have loved for spreads to stay 100 basis points wider as they were a year ago, we believe the opportunities we're seeing today offer very compelling spreads for the risks we're being asked to take. In our GP stakes business, our partner managers continue to benefit from 2 meaningful secular threats, growing allocations to alternatives and GP consolidation. Collectively, our partner managers now manage nearly $1.8 trillion, giving us an unparalleled view over the alternative asset management industry. Over the past decade, we've observed significant diversification across the industry, including the emergence and scaling of notable asset classes such as private credit as well as the expansion in the universe of investable assets for private capital. We've also seen market share accrue to the most established, largest private market managers, where our flagship funds have a leading market share. In addition, now that we've closed on some initial capital for our mid-cap strategy in partnership with Blue Net, we also are able to invest in the most exceptional managers that were not the right fit for our existing mandate. We're ready to capitalize on a visible pipeline of differentiated managers who are at an earlier stage of development and we think investors are very excited about this opportunity as well. In real estate, we continue to actively deploy capital at attractive cap rates close to 8% behind our 4 major themes: digital infrastructure, onshoring, health care real estate and essential retail. The capital needs in each of these areas is very significant and we have a good line of sight into capital deployment. In addition to the success we saw with our drawdown fund raise, which is now finished, we continue to see a meaningful step-up in private wealth flows. First quarter flows in our perpetually offered net lease product were 45% higher in the fourth quarter as a result of the stronger production from new distribution platforms. In summary, we're pleased with the continued expansion of our existing business and to supplement the robust growth we're already generating, we've announced some new acquisitions in areas that we find adjacent, strategic and synergistic and which could become quite substantial in the coming years. With that, let me turn it to Alan to discuss our financial results.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. To start off, we are pleased with the strong results we continue to report with the first quarter of 2024 being our 12th consecutive quarter every quarter since we listed of both management fee and FRE sequential growth, the only public alternative asset manager that has demonstrated this over this period. We've been able to achieve this because of our differentiated asset base and earnings profile with long-duration assets creating a recurring revenue profile while fundraising adds new layers to our layer cake of management fees and FRE. So let's go through some of the key highlights on an LTM year-over-year basis through March 31. Management fees are up 22% and 92% of these management fees are from permanent capital vehicles. FRE is up 24%, and our FRE margin is right on top of our 60% target and DE is up 20%. As you can see on Slide 12, we raised $4.7 billion in the first quarter and $16.7 billion for the last 12 months. Inclusive of debt capital, new capital raised was over $28 billion over the last 12 months. I'll break down the first quarter fundraising numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised $3 billion, $2.6 billion was raised in our diversified and first lien lending strategies, of which $1.3 billion was raised in our non-traded BDC, OCIC, up over 100% compared to the first quarter of 2023. The remainder was raised across software lending and our newly launched strategic equity, strategy. In GP Strategic Capital, we held an initial close of approximately $600 million for our new mid-cap strategy. In real estate, we raised approximately $1 billion with nearly $500 million for the sixth vintage drawdown fund, bringing that fund to its final close at $5.2 billion; and over $500 million in our non-traded REIT rent, up more than 70% compared to the first quarter of 2023. We are seeing increased engagement on the distribution platforms that added our rent in late 2023 and continue to see opportunities to expand distribution globally for this product. We're pleased with the increasing breadth of fundraising across strategies and products, which will continue to expand with the expected closing of our announced acquisitions of Kuvare and Prima. In addition, we've had very few assets leaving the system with distributions, redemptions and capital return aggregating just 4% of our average AUM over the last 12 months. We believe this number is approximately double for our peers and could increase further for them during more active monetization environments, highlighting Blue Owl's more durable asset base. Finally, to supplement the staying power of existing AUM and the benefit of ongoing fundraising, we have substantial embedded earnings that we will unlock over time. AUM not yet paying fees was $16.8 billion as of the first quarter corresponding to roughly $240 million of incremental annual management fees once deployed. This equates to a fee rate of approximately 1.4%. We also have approximately $135 million of incremental management fees that would turn on upon the listing of our remaining private BDCs over time. These 2 items alone would represent an increase of over 20% from our 2023 total FRE revenues. Moving on to our credit platform. We had gross originations of $8.9 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $2.9 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $24.9 billion with $9.8 billion of net funded deployment. Our credit portfolio returned 3.7% in the first quarter and 17.4% over the last 12 months. Weighted average LTVs are in the high 30s across Direct Lending and in the low 30s, specifically in our software lending portfolio. For our GP Strategic Capital platform, total invested commitments for our fifth GP stakes fund, including agreements in principle are over $11 billion of capital with line of sight into over $3 billion of opportunities, which if all signs would bring us through the remaining capital available in Fund V. And performance across these funds remained strong with a net IRR of 23% for Fund III, 42% for Fund IV and 15% for Fund V, which compare favorably to the median returns for private equity funds of the same vintages. And in our real estate platform, our pipeline of opportunities continues to grow, with nearly $4 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract to close. With regards to performance, we achieved gross returns across our real estate portfolio of over 6% over the last 12 months, comparing very favorably to the broader real estate market as a result of our distinctive net lease strategy and the timing of capital deployment. The net IRR across our fully realized funds has been 24%, which we think is impressive for essentially an investment grade and creditworthy tenant risk profile. Okay. Let's wrap up with a few closing thoughts. On taxes, just a reminder that we expect to return back to a low single-digit rate, say, 2% to 3% for the remainder of 2024, which should result in a roughly 5% tax rate for the full year, as I discussed on our last earnings call. In light of the recent acquisition announcements, I want to reiterate our outlook for a 60% FRE margin for the foreseeable future, investing dollars back into the business to drive long-term growth. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed a $750 million, 6.25% 10-year bond offering. We were pleased to see such strong levels of interest with the deal nearly 4 times oversubscribed from both investors who have been longtime supporters of our business as well as many debt investors that are new to our need. Finally, I'd like to touch on the significant shareholder transition that we've achieved since Blue Owl went public. In May of 2021, about 10% of our shares were held in the hands of public investors. Our float was about $1.5 billion. The other 90% of our shares were owned primarily by Neuberger Berman, management and private phase investors. Over the past 3 years, we have largely replaced our legacy private phase investors with long-term oriented public shareholders and we've also seen strong demand from public shareholders for the occasional sales by Neuberger Berman over the same period. Today, we have more than a thid of our total shares in the hands of public investors, increasing our float to more than $9 billion, 6 times greater than where we started. As for management, our lockup expired about a year ago, and there has been essentially no selling outside of charitable donations and estate planning. We're very pleased with the progress we've made in working through the technical overhang in Blue Owl stock and think that the shifting demand supply balance is a factor in how the stock has traded recently. With that, I'd like to thank everyone who has joined us on the call today. Operator, can we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAnn Dai: Alex, we can't hear you.\nAlex Blostein: Really nicely. You highlighted that, I think, in your prepared remarks as well. Can you pull back the layers a little bit and talk through sort of sources of increased sales? Is it same platforms, addition of new platforms? To what extent is it also including some broadening of the existing FA base within the platforms that you're already on? So just to kind of help us frame how to run rate the current pace of sales on a go-forward basis.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Alex, the very beginning of that, we didn't hear. Can you just repeat the very beginning, please? Apologies.\nAlex Blostein: Sorry. Yes. So I was just asking about the wealth channel trends you guys are seeing so far in the second quarter. It looks like April 1 subscriptions were really strong. So I was hoping to get a little bit more detail around the sources of strength in terms of new products or new platforms rather or sort of expanding footprint within the existing platforms and how to think about the run rate on a forward basis.\nMarc Lipschultz: Absolutely. Thank you, Alex. So wealth has been and continues to be strong. You obviously know our position, which, of course, is now coming up on taking nearly a decade to build this sort of platform, we really have a great embedded position with some products, which are growing, as you say, sort of by expansion of the usage in a platform. And then we have products that we have introduced that are growing by expansion of platforms. So actually, we see both when you look at our results in wealth. So in credit in our core income, in our tech income products, what we're really seeing there is increased adoption. That is more FAs and more clients using the product. So this is the virtuous circle we're on a lot of platforms and we've delivered great results for those investors. And so we have more FAs understanding how this is a really effective part of essentially a core allocation, and our product works really well for them. And so in the case of credit, I think you're seeing primarily the growth of user increases, more FAs, more customers. And of course, the beauty of that is this is still so limited in its penetration. When you really dive into the details, which obviously, we do on what's really being sold in the platform, how many people are using it how many clients does each FA that uses it and have involved, you get very excited about forward look in this opportunity set, which you can also see from the macro numbers when we just look at penetration of alts in general versus this very, very large world called retail, call it private wealth or you want to slice it. So we're seeing the virtuous circle of being a market leader in that credit platform at a very early participants and having, frankly, really, really great results. Real estate is a bit more of a study in the benefits. In this case, you get twofold benefits. Ultimately, become [indiscernible] credit, which is to become more about deeper and deeper penetration. Today, we're still even in the early stages of this increased platforms. So we -- this year, we'll be adding quite a number of platforms in real estate and we're seeing the benefits of that as we bring this product onto new platforms. It's given us whole new audiences. Remember, this is a product where we're delivering a 7% tax advantage return current plus appreciation with triple net leases on generally investment-grade, creditworthy counterparties. It's a really special product and consider this is a time when in real estate, most people are delivering negative returns and are having negative flows, we're growing and adding. So I think you have both actually perfectly well studied. And listen, any given month, any given quarter, but the trend line is crystal clean, right, which is we are continuing to see significant growth in wealth as a part of our platform and the continuously offer products and really zeroing in on because we always have episodic moments that we bring products like GP Solutions where you go on for a while and then you come back off of a platform. So we really feel good about wealth. And one other comment just while we're on it, and it's not about wealth, it's just about product in general. You take April, as you said. So in April, we raised $1 billion in these continuously offer products. And I think something that gets lost sometimes in a lot of the discussion and not -- I'm sure people appreciate it. But not all dollars are created equal. And just take a step back and when you raise $1 billion in kind of high quality, high value-added products that we do, which we get appropriately paid for. You square that against dollars raised. There's a lot of very commoditized products that all managers raise, and that's fine. People do all different strategies. As you know, our focus has been very much a high value-added product. But if you take a step back and think about what we earn on something like $1 billion in continuously offer products relative to, say, a highly commoditized product that we see people raising capital for, that literally can be the equivalent of needing to raise $10 billion in a commoditized insurance-like product. We're highly commoditized fixed income kind of products. So $1 billion in April, but quite literally, mathematically, it could be the equivalent of $10 billion of what many other people raise these days. So I think that is lost in this conversation about it's not as well. That's just about nature of product and get sorry to go off on that side track. But I think it's an important point also when we talk about the nature of dollars raised.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: We've heard a bit more recently about spread compression in private lending markets. So I was hoping to hear your perspective on what you're seeing on the ground. And if we are seeing some spread compression, what you think that might mean as far as the outlook for FRPR that's begun to come through on the P&L for you?\nMarc Lipschultz: Absolutely. So look, spreads -- so let's start with this. Yes, there's been spread compression, point of fact. There was spread expansion a year ago, 1.5 years ago. Before that, spreads were tighter. I look over the long arc of time that we have done now about $100 billion or so in originations. And it's no doubt the case that spreads go up and spreads come down. The key to our business is something really distinctive about private credit done right. Again, we are deeply focused on credit, credit, credit, principal preservation, downside protection and strong income results. And that has worked. We're running at a 7 basis point realized loss rate. So everything about doing this strategy, right, growing our business, which, of course, grows our fee-based is about delivering on the credit promise where we have been best of breed. And so the key to us, unlike many alternative products, let's call them the high octane products were vintage is a big question, you get in at the right time to get out at the right time great returns. But see, if you get into the wrong equity product in 2021 and now you're sitting here today with a couple of years just dead time behind you, you're probably going to struggle with returns. The big difference for us is unlike kind of entry moment in entry and exit moment. I think about this more as a box, a range, a ban. The key is, do we have really strong credits and are we getting an attractive return, attractive spread for those credits? And here's the good news on the corollary to our spreads compressed, have compressed. Is it attractive? Absolutely. Absolutely. The credit that we are seeing and the return you're earning, Remember, we're in a 532, 90-day LIBOR. So when you take spreads, it's I prefer the 100 basis points wider spreads than we were seeing 1.5 years ago. But the spreads we're seeing today aren't that different from what we saw 3 years ago, and those were really attractive loans and returns too. So I'm not being dismissive, we'll always prefer a higher spread, but that isn't. What matters to us is a band in which we're earning a very good return for a very moderated risk. And we're certainly operating in that band and feel good about it. As to FRPR, I mean we're in a pretty tight band, but I'll turn that over to Alan.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: Thank you, Marc. Brennan, I guess what I would add to that is a few things. We continue to expect to see our Part 1 fees coming up quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year as we go through 2024. There's a series of reasons for that. One, Marc just touched on the very strong fundraising we continue to see in our non-traded products like CIC and TIC. We continue to deploy good capital in products like OTF 2. So as we continue to deploy fundraise, we're going to continue to see strong increases in Part 1 fees. Also, if you go back to the end of last year, where the SOFR curve was and where it is today, throughout, let's say, 2024, we're still averaging let's say, 20 basis points or 30 basis points higher. And in 2025, where the curve is, we are 60 basis points to 80 basis points higher today than where we were back in December. So we will continue to see strong returns on our Part 1 fees, at least we would expect to because of all these things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Big picture question on credit. Obviously, direct lending, you're an animal, you're expanding in health care infrastructure. You got expanding real estate lending and Kuvare brings investment grade. Yet, I'm still going to ask the question of, do you feel like you have enough across private credit broadly? And maybe that's just really a question on what do you already have in asset-backed finance and what's your plan in terms of expanding there?\nMarc Lipschultz: Thanks, Glenn. And it's a great question. First, I want to reinforce, we indeed consider ourselves credit animals. Thank you for that. I like that one. With regard to the range of offerings, you characterize well, we certainly have built out adjacencies that take us from diversified direct lending, that led us, of course, a long time ago now to understanding the great merits of software lending, which has really worked it led us to first lien lending another derivative thereof that's really worked. We now have, as you point out, with our new acquisitions with Prima. We add -- it's very strong rated real estate oriented debt at a time when that market is deeply disrupted with Kuvare. We add, of course, other adjacent investment grade or stronger credit derivative opportunities. So we definitely have widened that range and we like that. To answer your question very spot on, we have some parts of alternative credit very strongly. -- as we've commented, but I'll share the skin, beneath the surface, we actually do a lot of lending in areas people don't particularly share of our large business may not focus on, but we have developed very strong skills in railcar leasing -- in aircraft leasing in ABL finance with Wingspire in life settlements in royalties in health care, as you pointed out, we've done about $13 billion of loans. So there's a lot we have built organically, and we will continue to utilize that capability for both our diversified products and over time as appropriate in other specialized or asset-backed products. So we have the organic tools. Are there other areas to put it rhetorically, that we could add in an alternative credit or asset-based credit, absolutely true. So we continue to look at build, buy and they're neither mutually exclusive nor mutually required, which is to say we've got a lot of tools to be successful in asset-based finance. We would be perfectly open to and interested in adding more tools and we have our eyes open for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Now that you've added both real estate debt and insurance capabilities to the platform, I was hoping you could just speak to your confidence level in hitting or approaching the dollar dividend in 25, it might be helpful to outline the road map similar to actually, Alan, how you laid it out last earnings call, just given the building block should look a little bit different than before.\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. Yes, thank you. Look, it is our favorite topic, as we talk about all the time, which is continued path to the dollar dividend. And sitting here today, we continue to feel the same way. We are moving right forward being in and around that dollar. And every quarter where we march forward up into the right to quote, I think, Glen's title or the Blue Street continues, I think, to use yours. We move a quarter closer and the band effectively gets tighter. When we complete steps of these, and it's not enormously complicated ladder or set of steps. But when we get things done, like this quarter, we said, look, we expect it will include strategic acquisition as part of it. We did two this last quarter. We expect we'll take other BDCs or some of them public over time. We did that with BDC, which is trading really well. And meantime, BDC trades at a premium to book. So we're slowly ticking it off in the sort of I'm going to compile and I'll also add Brennen's title as well. We think we are the boring Blue Street moving up and to the right. So I think I've merged with proper attribution, 3 titles together. And that the destination, the goal is to get to that dollar, and we continue to feel good about being in and around that level. So let me turn it over to Alan to give you the building blocks to go with that.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: We are on track to be in or around the $1 share. I'm going to approach this in 2 ways, if that's okay. I just want to remind everyone, we have a significant amount of embedded earnings power in our business. We have about $1 billion of revenues that would, over the course of 3 different things that would bring our 2023 revenues up over 60%. And so that $1 billion of revenues is about a quarter of that $240 million is just deploying the AUM that has not yet earning fees that we've already raised. We've got over $200 million in BDC step-up fees, of which to Marc's 80 we just turned on earlier this quarter in January. And those 2 items alone, that's almost $0.5 billion, that's over a 25% increase to our 2023 revenues. Then when you add fund raise for just our GP Stakes 6 product and our 2 BDC non-traded products, that's another $600 million over the course of this year and next year that would increase revenues by over 60%. We -- but to narrow in now on the $1 a share. So Marc has already talked about a number of things. There's a lot of exciting things we're working on. Almost all of those, as I think we've all talked about in the past are actually dilutive to the dollar share. That's us putting dollars back into the business to focus on keeping our industry-leading growth beyond the dollar share beyond 2025. There's just 3 things now. So last quarter, there were 4 things we needed to do. Now there's 3 things we need to do to get in and around that $1 a share. Marc touched on the fourth, which fell away now. We've done an accretive transaction. We've done too. And so we check that off. That's done. So there's 3 things left. And on my scorecard, at least, when I think of those 3 things, we've got fundraise for our non-traded products at CIC, TIC and Oren. And as we just talked about in the earlier question, we are certainly on track and doing very well towards achieving what we need to in fund rates for our non-traded products. So I checked that as on track. Fundraise for GP Stakes 6. We continue to get a lot of interest in that product, and we expect fundraising to go very well there. We expect to hit our $13 billion target. So I consider that on track as well. And then the third of the 3 items left is to list 1 of the 2 software lending BDCs. And I won't comment on timing for either of those. But we continue to think that there's something to do there over the course of this year or next year. So we are tracking very well to be in and around that $1 a share for 2025.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I think they got my last name better on your call than the last one. So my question is on M&A. You've added real estate debt and insurance just this year. And I think this morning, the FT is citing infrastructure as the next lightly white space. So I wanted to get your updated thoughts on M&A and real specifically, what do you think of infrastructure equity and infrastructure debt?\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. So let me just take one step back and frame our business has a very, very clear DNA, right? We focus on a being very deep in an adjacent and tightly bound sound of products. And we've talked about this about for before, but there's different strategies. There's the -- all directions on the Compass strategy and many of our very successful peers pursue that strategy, picture what we're doing as a northbound highway. It's got a lot of lanes. In the lanes we occupy, we intend to be the leader or a leader. We're clearly well leader in triple net lease, the leader in GP Stakes, a leader in Direct Lending, a couple of other cars, but pretty -- that makes we're pretty uncrowded commute when there's just a few cars in the lane. And then we've added some other thesis there are direct adjacency\u2019s, and you know on the exact infrastructure question. So Prima and insurance, Kuvare offer 2 quite different additions to our capability set. So look, we're in real estate, and we're in credit and we have certainly launched for a very long time as to when we could do real estate credit. Well, not too hard to figure out contingency of that statement. And we've said it on these prior calls before. Here's the history with real estate credit. We, as a credit firm, of course, has been to approach all the time with I think we've now looked at close to 10,000 different loans. And certainly, we've been approached about real estate loans. And the phenomenon we have for years and years is we would be willing to do the work in our current diversified products in the area, we could do real estate is a piece of it. But every time we put in doing the credit work on what was behind the leases, what was behind the credit, we ended up seeing like-for-like, the spreads were way tighter and leverage higher than a comparable direct corporate law. So we didn't do it. And I don't know at the time, we always said to each other, I don't understand what you say the word real estate. All of a sudden, it's supposed to be at a tighter spread. Well, loan hall is not. It turns out, it's not. And here we are now where the market has become very disruptive, and it becomes a very interesting point for us to bring our skills in real estate and credit into this highly disrupted market and by bringing Fremont board who are really good at this. And remember, again, this is a very focused strategy. Prima does something, single asset, single borrower focus, risk retention, really good at it. This is much higher grade product. So they have a very good book. We're not spending time thinking about, gee, what is the workout going to look like in real estate as almost any real estate lender would. So that's a wonderful addition. We're using M&A in a sort of strategic and tactical way to add some terrific skills that we can build off organically. So that's a filling of a really nice capability product and team. Insurance, think about that as horizontal, right? We have successfully become a leader in delivering institutional solutions, institutional fund raising, wealth, where we're a market leader. The one we've been missing is insurance, deliver and solutions properly packaged properly structured for the insurance user. Remember, we always talk about this. We don't have different products for different people. We have different entry ramps, we customize the structures, we customize and continuous solve our product because individual investors value some of that flexibility. It's different from what institutions value, so we customize their product. Now with Kuvare, we've added some complementary capabilities. But most importantly, we now have a way of customizing the solution for that user of capital. So now we have the third core leg of the stool. We now have wealth and we have institutional and we have insurance. So think about that as horizontal, taking our capabilities. And again, our product suite is particularly well suited to the insurance user. And now we have the abilities to bring that bundle together and deliver the solutions to not compete with the insurance industry. So I would say those two, you can see are quite different. One adds a capability right in our sweet spot. One is horizontal. It's not really about adding new products. It's about adding a way to deliver those products in a way that's perfectly packaged for its users. So last to the FT article, I mean I can't control their the title and the poised infrastructure is a little disproportionate. It's just compatible what we've observed before, which is when we think about our products, which is downside protection with strong predictable returns, generally current income inflation protection that brings you very naturally to a few areas. It brings you to at the right moment, something like real estate credit, okay? Well, we have our foothold there. It brings you to things like asset-based lending, and we just talked about that. We have a lot of organic capabilities, and we'll have an eye on both organic and inorganic possibilities there. And to our way, another example would be infrastructure. I don't do anything in infrastructure or not. Again, I think the emphasis is a bit excessive with the title -- but I think if you read through the article or kind of incorporate it with what I'm about to say, it's a natural area that's adjacent for us because it's a space that is about lower risk, principal preservation, strong returns and income orientation, and that could either be in the infrastructure debt or infrastructure equity. And so I view that as more an example of how we can stay very tight to our strategy. Do what we do well, understand our DNA well, but do it in an adjacent product. whether we do that or not, it's not as if, okay, next up. I think it's more about an example of how we think about the world strategically, which is to stay very deep in a very, very tightly balanced strategically aligned side of products.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bill Katz from TB Colin. Your line is now open.\nBill Katz: So just one of the debates comes up a lot is just a higher for longer backdrop. And how does that sort of the ebbs and flows of that, the puts and takes. So I was wondering, I think the Part 1 fees are pretty straightforward. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just the resilience of the platform, particularly on the credit side, if we were to stay in the higher for longer. And how to think through the bear case that it would have a pickup in credit losses against a portfolio that has improvement over prior credit cycles as currently put together.\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. And Alan, I can probably comment on it, but let me start with the headline. Look, we do floating rate debt that is our business for our investors. And that is mathematically definitionally means when rates are higher, the absolute returns for our investors are on average higher. And when rates are lower, on average, they'll be a little bit lower. Sitting here today, and look, there's a lot of things we've been right about and wrong about and that will continue to be true. But I will say that a year ago, and everyone on this call probably can check us on this one, we have been talking about the higher for longer case for quite a long time. And we see it through our portfolio. Remember, we have almost 400 companies that we lend money to, and we study them and work with them very, very closely. And what we have seen consistently for the last year and still today, is inflation has not gone away. Now that's a consensus view. It seemed like a only voice in the words a year ago, even 4 months ago, we don't have this conversation when the world was talking about 7 rate cuts. Now we're in a world where it's somewhere balanced between 0 rate cuts and 1 right back to the new consensus. And that's a reality of what's happening from the ground up. We see wage pressures continue. You see cost pressures continue. Importantly, we see all these companies raising their prices. Someone's paying for that. So when you add it all together, inflation is not, of course, is not ranging the way it was 1.5 years ago, it's very real. So look, that does bring us to the higher for longer view from the ground up or not macro experts. But as a result of that, in a higher-for-longer world, which now seems pretty likely, of course, that does flow through in ever higher returns for our investors and to agree FPR. Remember, what's really important, though, other than the small amount of variance around fee related, which is not the RPR, which is a modest part of our revenue base. You have to remember, we at Blue Holland you know this, but I'm saying it more broadly, we have Blue Owl paid fees to manage the business. There's no carry. We have no capital markets fees. We don't have all these other variable fees that other people have to manage, which is complicated. Our business is very straightforward. And even with gyrations in spread or whether we do have a rate cut, don't have a rate cut, really, really moderate impacts on our business. So I'm going to let Alan comment on that, and then I'll come back to the credit question you had, and it's the case.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: So two points here, I guess. One, I made the comment earlier in 2025, when you look at the curve today. versus at the end of the year, we're at 60 basis points to 80 basis points higher on the curve than where we were to translate that to how that impacts our business. I mentioned in the last quarter's call when asked about a rate decline question. I had said that about 100 basis points of rate decline would be about $40 million of increased or decreased. And now in this case, it's increased as opposed to the question last quarter, which would be decreased about $40 million of increased annual management fees.\nMarc Lipschultz: And then let me tack back on to the credit question and attack it a couple of ways. First of all, and I said this before, within the land of our credit business, credit is everything. It's what we focus on. It's what we're focused on from day 1. It's why we focus on the large end of the market. It's why we focus so intensely on low loan to values, which in our portfolio, they remain on average in the 40s. So we're -- and in software lower, our portfolio performance. You look at our -- we look at our most recent results, on average, the EBITDA and revenue in our portfolio companies grew on average in the last quarter that we just finished our data analysis on at double digits. So we understand and of course, we're always thinking about, gee, the credit downturn, which is really economic downturn right? -- separate thing called the credit downturn unless you do credit poorly, and I feel confident we haven't done that. And so at the end of the day, we're still growing robustly in our portfolio on average. Of course, there's going to be peculiar credit issues. Of course, there's companies that have their own peculiar challenges. But remember, our nonaccruals are well below 1% of our book. And our loss rate historically now has been at 7 basis points per year. So I think we're starting from an incredibly good place. And here's I guess 2 things to take away from that. We care intensely about credit. As an investor in the Blue Owl stock, they'll again, remember, we could pay fees to manage these funds. So ultimately, that's not really a question that bears on the shareholder of Blue Owl in any meaningful way, matters to us and it matters grow a lot to our LPs, and that's what we work for every single day. So we're intensely focused on it, but it's not really an earnings question. Last point, I think this is what also gets lost in the conversations about credit. I absolutely do get and agree that people -- we can say, Hey, we just don't know because there's this new thing called private credit, not so new and it hasn't been fully tested well pass on through with test, but it is a good way of just creating for those who wish to uncertainty. There's a lot of data, a lot, right? I just told you our data on nearly $100 billion of loans, and it hasn't exactly been sailing to the land of COVID and wars and runs on banks. And again, it hasn't been a deep dark recession. But actually, the tar recessions have happened in the land of leveraged credit. This isn't new. We're making loans to the same companies, except with tighter documents and lower loan to values that the syndicated market did back in the 2000s, and we actually do know what that looks like. And frankly, if it was that -- even that bad, so to speak, think about the returns. We're starting with unlevered returns today, depending on, again, which spread we're all using 10% to 12%. You can take pretty meaningful changes in defaults and still have one heck of a risk return. So we think about it all the time. But I really think this sort of propensity of say, this market is just on test. It actually is extremely well tested. It just hasn't been tested, frankly, in this more durable format. And I think what you will find. When that test comes in this exact format, I think you're going to find out that loan losses are lower. Because you have parties in bilateral arrangements with very aligned incentives, which is, you know what, we all want this company to do well. We all want this company to thrive and pay back its capital, burn games, there are tricks the aren't credit default swaps. There aren't credit on creditor violence, all that stuff will happen in the syndicated market. So yes, you'll live that stuff again in private credit, I would proffer that you're going to see a better experience when that version of days comes again.\nOperator: Question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Davitt: My question is on Kuvare. Could you help us frame maybe how much run rate organic flow you expect from the insurance entity post close maybe how fast that has been growing? And then more broadly, contrast how you see alt's insurance TAM versus others. Given your asset classes are generally outside of the lower fee fixed income replacement assets, most of the other alts are focusing on.\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. So I don't want to speak on behalf of Kuvare, the insurance company, which remember, we are buying the asset manager, and we're an asset manager, so balance sheet light provider of management services, and they are a really strong insurance originator. So that's their side of the equation. I don't mean that in a lack of partner way. We're very much partnered, but I want to understand that they are the insurance company, we are their partner asset manager. With that said, we know that, for example, last year, they grew their book by $5.6 billion. So part of this whole exercise was to get more capital freed up and focused on supporting the growth of their insurance company, including our $250 million preferred investment. So last year was $5.6 billion. They were looking for more capital to continue to grow and to grow, I think we'll continue to see very healthy growth. They have a great origination business. I've mentioned this before, but they punch way above their weight. Here's a firm of a size that is in the Japanese market, which is one of the most discerning markets, as I understand it, for these types of annuity products. And they're right in there with the very biggest and the very best. And I think it's a real credit to what they've done on the insurance origination and management side. So I won't forecast their number for them, but I think it is safe to say that given the growth they've had in the past, we expect to see that kind of growth continues, that's why they want the capital.\nAlan Kirshenbaum: And the vast majority of that growth is going to come for assets that we manage going forward.\nMarc Lipschultz: Yes. And remember, we now require the whole of their asset management business, which means we do have all the product capabilities built out. That you just described. So with this brings to us the ability to deliver the comprehensive solution, you just postulated about others. So we do have all that now. Our focus isn't on the low fee products. But we have the capabilities now and it's not like we just missed having matter just having the comprehensive set of solutions. It will be part of our growth profile going forward, too. So we do have that full range today. In terms of the addressable market, it's actually a really interesting question. We all know this is evolving in the interrelationship between insurance and asset management or alternative asset managers. And there's different models, I don't think there's one singular right model. I will say that our model is built around staying very focused on being really good at asset management and letting insurance companies to be really good at insurance and being a partner to them as opposed to a competitor with them, which is very consistent with our model. We are a capital solutions provider with the picks and shovels, right? We do that. We provide capital solutions to GPs themselves with our GP solutions business, help them grow their businesses. We provide capital solutions to corporate owners of real estate to help them grow their businesses. We provide financing solutions to PE portfolio companies. And now with our below strategic equity, we provide GP Continuation Capital. All of those are solutions to, for example, a private equity firm, not competition with the private equity firm. So I think we've got a very clear focus and same thing in insurance. We are now -- we are their partner, and we're here to help them grow and not try to take growth from them.\nOperator: Our next question from Crispin Love from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nCrispin Love: You hit on this a little bit with a prior question, but just with the announced acquisition of Prima. You explain why you did the deal and how you do the credit work. But can you discuss what opportunities you're most interested in once the deal closes? Would you expect to be active in distressed areas such as deals in office or be active in multifamily or kind of other areas like CMBS in addition to deals more related to your triple net lease product, but on the debt side. Just curious, your thoughts here on where you might add capital in this part of the business when the deal closes?\nMarc Lipschultz: Sure. Well, let me start with this observation on every acquisition we make, our mission is to have a best-of-class team as a part of that, and we have that with Prima, which also means first job is to make sure we only enhance doing well at they already do, we once combined. And that's been true. Look at our Oak Street business, now the real estate business. That's a business that has thrived because they're great at what they do, again, now we, but is phrasing, I'm purposely trying to be intentional about this idea of not ever disrupted only enhancing the investment process. So our first job is to continue to do a fantastic job for Prima LPs in the products they have. Now with their capabilities and ours, there are opportunities for us to deliver great results to their existing or new LPs and do so well for our shareholders. When you think about where we'll go, remember we also have now brought on a world-class real estate finance professional, Jesse Hom. Jesse Hom, who is quite well known in the world of real estate finance, having led this at GIC will be joining us to lead this overall initiative. So Prima comes on board, we'll keep doing Prima really well. And then we will extend -- to answer your question, again, remember our DNA and our comfort, our idea is to go into a market and find ways to take risk out and are really attractive, stable returns. So that would tend towards leaning our mindset, not toward opportunistic stress let's go find a messy office building rather it, hey, this is a dysfunctional market now. We can go in and do very high-quality things that are much lower leverage, much less deep in the cap stack and earn a very active return providing that capital. So I think that frame of reference is likely to be more where we live than all of a sudden trying to move out to the periphery of return seekers, that's not our mission. Our mission is to have sleep at night well money for our investors and deliver really good returns for it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Mckenna. Your line is now open.\nBrian Mckenna: Most questions have been asked, but just a quick one for me. So you've clearly been active on the M&A front, and you've also made a number of senior hires as well. So I think integration of all these businesses and people will be important to the longer-term growth and success of Blue Owl. So what are you doing to make sure integration of all this is successful over time? And I guess what I'm getting at is how do you make sure 1 plus 1 equals more than 2?\nMarc Lipschultz: That is exactly right at exactly what we focus on and exactly where I think we've developed now, I'd say, our muscles to do it well. We think integration is critical. And that is part of -- again, the benefit here is don't disrupt anything about the strong investment performance and practices of businesses but enhance them with the intellectual capital and capabilities that we have, bring the backbone that we have operationally to each of these companies to help support them doing an even better job at the investment business. I want to make sure we say this. We've talked a lot about M&A on here. The vast preponderance of our growth is organic. And the M&A is actually pretty moderate when you get down to a number of people, impact on business. I just talked about Prima. It's a wonderful business. It comes with a wonderful team. It does something very specific, though. It's not this isn't some grand complex integration. Actually, it's pretty straightforward. And that's not to take it lightly. It's just to say we to distinguish between complicated integrations and acquisitions, not something that we pursue with any great vigor and relatively simple ones like a Prima. So an acquisition is not an acquisition in the generic set. That said, I think we feel very, very good about our pathway. And let me just point back to real estate. So Oak Street, when we acquired Oak Street now our real estate business, I believe it had about $70 million in FRE. And today, we're running at about $200 million of FRE. Triple. Tripled that business. And Marc Zahr and his team and Chair and others have been phenomenally effective as an integrated part of this firm. Michael Reiter, who comes in as operational integrates to our operations that has been an absolutely case study for us in how we can do this. And so we learn our lessons. Again, we're not saying we're perfect by any measure. But I think we feel very, very good that we can handle these acquisitions, and we'll be very, very careful as we look and we'll continue to look at organic and inorganic growth, but let's not lose track of the fact that most of our growth has been and likely will be organic growth up and to the right, the boring Blue Street up to the right.\nOperator: We don't have any questions at this moment. I'd now like to hand back over to Marc for final remarks.\nMarc Lipschultz: Great. Thank you all very much. Really appreciate the time and your patience and your interest, and we're going to go away and be credit animals and try to do some more boring quarters for you. But we do appreciate it very much and back to it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks for attending today's call. We hope you have a wonderful day. Stay safe.",

            "name": "Alan Kirshenbaum",
            "content": "Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. To start off, we are pleased with the strong results we continue to report with the first quarter of 2024 being our 12th consecutive quarter every quarter since we listed of both management fee and FRE sequential growth, the only public alternative asset manager that has demonstrated this over this period. We've been able to achieve this because of our differentiated asset base and earnings profile with long-duration assets creating a recurring revenue profile while fundraising adds new layers to our layer cake of management fees and FRE. So let's go through some of the key highlights on an LTM year-over-year basis through March 31. Management fees are up 22% and 92% of these management fees are from permanent capital vehicles. FRE is up 24%, and our FRE margin is right on top of our 60% target and DE is up 20%. As you can see on Slide 12, we raised $4.7 billion in the first quarter and $16.7 billion for the last 12 months. Inclusive of debt capital, new capital raised was over $28 billion over the last 12 months. I'll break down the first quarter fundraising numbers across our strategies and products. In credit, we raised $3 billion, $2.6 billion was raised in our diversified and first lien lending strategies, of which $1.3 billion was raised in our non-traded BDC, OCIC, up over 100% compared to the first quarter of 2023. The remainder was raised across software lending and our newly launched strategic equity, strategy. In GP Strategic Capital, we held an initial close of approximately $600 million for our new mid-cap strategy. In real estate, we raised approximately $1 billion with nearly $500 million for the sixth vintage drawdown fund, bringing that fund to its final close at $5.2 billion; and over $500 million in our non-traded REIT rent, up more than 70% compared to the first quarter of 2023. We are seeing increased engagement on the distribution platforms that added our rent in late 2023 and continue to see opportunities to expand distribution globally for this product. We're pleased with the increasing breadth of fundraising across strategies and products, which will continue to expand with the expected closing of our announced acquisitions of Kuvare and Prima. In addition, we've had very few assets leaving the system with distributions, redemptions and capital return aggregating just 4% of our average AUM over the last 12 months. We believe this number is approximately double for our peers and could increase further for them during more active monetization environments, highlighting Blue Owl's more durable asset base. Finally, to supplement the staying power of existing AUM and the benefit of ongoing fundraising, we have substantial embedded earnings that we will unlock over time. AUM not yet paying fees was $16.8 billion as of the first quarter corresponding to roughly $240 million of incremental annual management fees once deployed. This equates to a fee rate of approximately 1.4%. We also have approximately $135 million of incremental management fees that would turn on upon the listing of our remaining private BDCs over time. These 2 items alone would represent an increase of over 20% from our 2023 total FRE revenues. Moving on to our credit platform. We had gross originations of $8.9 billion for the quarter and net funded deployment of $2.9 billion. This brings our gross originations for the last 12 months to $24.9 billion with $9.8 billion of net funded deployment. Our credit portfolio returned 3.7% in the first quarter and 17.4% over the last 12 months. Weighted average LTVs are in the high 30s across Direct Lending and in the low 30s, specifically in our software lending portfolio. For our GP Strategic Capital platform, total invested commitments for our fifth GP stakes fund, including agreements in principle are over $11 billion of capital with line of sight into over $3 billion of opportunities, which if all signs would bring us through the remaining capital available in Fund V. And performance across these funds remained strong with a net IRR of 23% for Fund III, 42% for Fund IV and 15% for Fund V, which compare favorably to the median returns for private equity funds of the same vintages. And in our real estate platform, our pipeline of opportunities continues to grow, with nearly $4 billion of transaction volume under letter of intent or contract to close. With regards to performance, we achieved gross returns across our real estate portfolio of over 6% over the last 12 months, comparing very favorably to the broader real estate market as a result of our distinctive net lease strategy and the timing of capital deployment. The net IRR across our fully realized funds has been 24%, which we think is impressive for essentially an investment grade and creditworthy tenant risk profile. Okay. Let's wrap up with a few closing thoughts. On taxes, just a reminder that we expect to return back to a low single-digit rate, say, 2% to 3% for the remainder of 2024, which should result in a roughly 5% tax rate for the full year, as I discussed on our last earnings call. In light of the recent acquisition announcements, I want to reiterate our outlook for a 60% FRE margin for the foreseeable future, investing dollars back into the business to drive long-term growth. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed a $750 million, 6.25% 10-year bond offering. We were pleased to see such strong levels of interest with the deal nearly 4 times oversubscribed from both investors who have been longtime supporters of our business as well as many debt investors that are new to our need. Finally, I'd like to touch on the significant shareholder transition that we've achieved since Blue Owl went public. In May of 2021, about 10% of our shares were held in the hands of public investors. Our float was about $1.5 billion. The other 90% of our shares were owned primarily by Neuberger Berman, management and private phase investors. Over the past 3 years, we have largely replaced our legacy private phase investors with long-term oriented public shareholders and we've also seen strong demand from public shareholders for the occasional sales by Neuberger Berman over the same period. Today, we have more than a thid of our total shares in the hands of public investors, increasing our float to more than $9 billion, 6 times greater than where we started. As for management, our lockup expired about a year ago, and there has been essentially no selling outside of charitable donations and estate planning. We're very pleased with the progress we've made in working through the technical overhang in Blue Owl stock and think that the shifting demand supply balance is a factor in how the stock has traded recently. With that, I'd like to thank everyone who has joined us on the call today. Operator, can we please open the line for questions? Alex, the very beginning of that, we didn't hear. Can you just repeat the very beginning, please? Apologies. Thank you, Marc. Brennan, I guess what I would add to that is a few things. We continue to expect to see our Part 1 fees coming up quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year as we go through 2024. There's a series of reasons for that. One, Marc just touched on the very strong fundraising we continue to see in our non-traded products like CIC and TIC. We continue to deploy good capital in products like OTF 2. So as we continue to deploy fundraise, we're going to continue to see strong increases in Part 1 fees. Also, if you go back to the end of last year, where the SOFR curve was and where it is today, throughout, let's say, 2024, we're still averaging let's say, 20 basis points or 30 basis points higher. And in 2025, where the curve is, we are 60 basis points to 80 basis points higher today than where we were back in December. So we will continue to see strong returns on our Part 1 fees, at least we would expect to because of all these things. We are on track to be in or around the $1 share. I'm going to approach this in 2 ways, if that's okay. I just want to remind everyone, we have a significant amount of embedded earnings power in our business. We have about $1 billion of revenues that would, over the course of 3 different things that would bring our 2023 revenues up over 60%. And so that $1 billion of revenues is about a quarter of that $240 million is just deploying the AUM that has not yet earning fees that we've already raised. We've got over $200 million in BDC step-up fees, of which to Marc's 80 we just turned on earlier this quarter in January. And those 2 items alone, that's almost $0.5 billion, that's over a 25% increase to our 2023 revenues. Then when you add fund raise for just our GP Stakes 6 product and our 2 BDC non-traded products, that's another $600 million over the course of this year and next year that would increase revenues by over 60%. We -- but to narrow in now on the $1 a share. So Marc has already talked about a number of things. There's a lot of exciting things we're working on. Almost all of those, as I think we've all talked about in the past are actually dilutive to the dollar share. That's us putting dollars back into the business to focus on keeping our industry-leading growth beyond the dollar share beyond 2025. There's just 3 things now. So last quarter, there were 4 things we needed to do. Now there's 3 things we need to do to get in and around that $1 a share. Marc touched on the fourth, which fell away now. We've done an accretive transaction. We've done too. And so we check that off. That's done. So there's 3 things left. And on my scorecard, at least, when I think of those 3 things, we've got fundraise for our non-traded products at CIC, TIC and Oren. And as we just talked about in the earlier question, we are certainly on track and doing very well towards achieving what we need to in fund rates for our non-traded products. So I checked that as on track. Fundraise for GP Stakes 6. We continue to get a lot of interest in that product, and we expect fundraising to go very well there. We expect to hit our $13 billion target. So I consider that on track as well. And then the third of the 3 items left is to list 1 of the 2 software lending BDCs. And I won't comment on timing for either of those. But we continue to think that there's something to do there over the course of this year or next year. So we are tracking very well to be in and around that $1 a share for 2025. So two points here, I guess. One, I made the comment earlier in 2025, when you look at the curve today. versus at the end of the year, we're at 60 basis points to 80 basis points higher on the curve than where we were to translate that to how that impacts our business. I mentioned in the last quarter's call when asked about a rate decline question. I had said that about 100 basis points of rate decline would be about $40 million of increased or decreased. And now in this case, it's increased as opposed to the question last quarter, which would be decreased about $40 million of increased annual management fees. And the vast majority of that growth is going to come for assets that we manage going forward."

            "name": "Marc Lipschultz",
            "content": "Great. Thank you very much, Ann. We reported another strong quarter of results for Blue Owl this morning with 12 straight quarters in consecutive management fee and FRE growth since we've been a public company. We're very pleased with the predictable, consistent and robust growth we've been able to generate for our shareholders across a range of market backdrops, reflecting the benefits of our FRE-centric and permanent capital heavy business model. Said plainly, our earnings consists almost entirely of management fees, so we're not subject to the volatility and uncertainty of revenues tied to realized gains and capital markets activity. And having long-duration capital means that very little use of our system, providing us with a resilient asset base that grows faster than our peer group for the same number of dollars rates. We think the market is starting to understand and appreciate the value of these stabilized attributes and how they contribute to our premium growth profile. On a 12-month year-over-year basis, we grew FRE revenue and FRE by 24% and DE by 20%. We're humbled to be among the leaders in these metrics across our whole peer group that includes very accomplished firms in our industry and it's something we don't take lightly as we continue to plant the seeds for future growth at Blue Owl. Globally, demand for differentiated income-driven returns remains very strong, and we continue to see good interest in our credit, GP's strategic capital and real estate strategies across institutional and wealth investors. During the quarter, we held the final close on our latest triple net lease fund, bringing in nearly $500 million. We raised $5.2 billion total after receiving approval to exceed our hard cap of $5 billion. This fund was the largest U.S. focused real estate fund in 2023 and more than doubled the size of its predecessor fund, demonstrating significant investor demand despite a very challenging backdrop for real estate fun raise in general. In the wealth channel, gross flows into our perpetually distributed products reached $2.1 billion in the first quarter, 16% higher than the fourth quarter and almost double what we raised in the first quarter of 2023. And in April alone, we've raised close to $1 billion in those perpetual products. We also closed on $1.4 billion of institutional capital in our direct lending business, across separate accounts and closes for our first lien lending and strategic equity strategies, complementing to continued growth in wealth. And our new mid-cap GP strategic capital strategy is off to a very good start with over $0.5 billion raised during the first quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced 2 acquisitions that further expand our suite of investment offerings and broaden the markets to which we provide capital solutions. First, we made a preferred investment into Kuvare and announced our intention to acquire Kuvare Asset Management, reflecting a creative and accretive way to broaden Blue Owl's value proposition to the insurance space. The Global Life and annuity market is over $20 trillion in size and an increase in number of insurance companies are looking to partner with specialized asset managers that can create better risk-adjusted returns through differentiated sourcing, underwriting and structuring. By adding a set of more IG-focused credit and real estate capabilities to Blue Owl's existing and scaled origination platforms, we can bring a more comprehensive insurance asset management solution in the marketplace. We will also benefit from Kuvare as we expect they will continue to take market share in an expanding annuities market. Acquiring Kuvare Asset Management adds $20 billion of AUM or but not inclusive of incremental growth at Kuvare. I think we approached this acquisition in a very Blue Owl way, meaning we came from a mindset of providing solutions to not competing with our clients. We had no desire to become balance sheet heavy or to become an insurance company. Instead, we plan to partner with them and allow them to continue to do what they do best, underwriting liabilities, while we focus on what we do best at managing assets. This solution's mentality is in keeping with what you see across the rest of our business. In direct lending, for instance, we provide financing solutions to sponsors for their portfolio companies. In GP stakes, we provide capital to the sponsors themselves. We prefer to help them grow their businesses as opposed to competing with them in those businesses. Now turning back to M&A. The second transaction we announced recently was our intention to acquire Prima Capital, an investment manager focused on real estate lending with approximately $10 billion of assets under management. Structurally, we see an increasing need for capital to finance real estate and have been interested in expanding our capabilities in this area. Prima struck us as a great fit for Blue Owl given its leading position, high-quality portfolio and strong historical track record through cycles, and we expect to leverage Blue Owl's scale and expertise to accelerate expansion. Pro forma for these 2 transactions, Blue Owl AUM would exceed $200 billion, crossing another meaningful milestone. Now moving on to business performance. In credit, we saw a fairly constructive environment for deployment with elevated repayment activity. As a reminder, the return of syndicated market activity reflects greater market participant confidence, which, over time, will enable increasing M&A activity. We've proven we can deploy significant capital when syndicated markets are active, and we believe we're well positioned to do it again. Knowing the outsized market share the direct lenders have seen over the past 1.5 years, the longer-term secular trend has been one in which sponsors have increasingly gravitated towards direct lenders for the value proposition they offer, and we see this trend continue. We see healthy sponsor appetite to deploy incremental dry powder and monetize existing investments over time and we expect Blue Owl to play a meaningful role in new capital deployment and refinancings. As Alan will detail, direct lending metrics remained strong. We have had just 7 basis points annualized realized loss, which has largely been offset by realized gains. And the underlying revenue and EBITDA growth of the portfolio remains in the low double digits on average. High level, our observation is that the economy is sound and rates are likely to be higher for one. While we would have loved for spreads to stay 100 basis points wider as they were a year ago, we believe the opportunities we're seeing today offer very compelling spreads for the risks we're being asked to take. In our GP stakes business, our partner managers continue to benefit from 2 meaningful secular threats, growing allocations to alternatives and GP consolidation. Collectively, our partner managers now manage nearly $1.8 trillion, giving us an unparalleled view over the alternative asset management industry. Over the past decade, we've observed significant diversification across the industry, including the emergence and scaling of notable asset classes such as private credit as well as the expansion in the universe of investable assets for private capital. We've also seen market share accrue to the most established, largest private market managers, where our flagship funds have a leading market share. In addition, now that we've closed on some initial capital for our mid-cap strategy in partnership with Blue Net, we also are able to invest in the most exceptional managers that were not the right fit for our existing mandate. We're ready to capitalize on a visible pipeline of differentiated managers who are at an earlier stage of development and we think investors are very excited about this opportunity as well. In real estate, we continue to actively deploy capital at attractive cap rates close to 8% behind our 4 major themes: digital infrastructure, onshoring, health care real estate and essential retail. The capital needs in each of these areas is very significant and we have a good line of sight into capital deployment. In addition to the success we saw with our drawdown fund raise, which is now finished, we continue to see a meaningful step-up in private wealth flows. First quarter flows in our perpetually offered net lease product were 45% higher in the fourth quarter as a result of the stronger production from new distribution platforms. In summary, we're pleased with the continued expansion of our existing business and to supplement the robust growth we're already generating, we've announced some new acquisitions in areas that we find adjacent, strategic and synergistic and which could become quite substantial in the coming years. With that, let me turn it to Alan to discuss our financial results. Absolutely. Thank you, Alex. So wealth has been and continues to be strong. You obviously know our position, which, of course, is now coming up on taking nearly a decade to build this sort of platform, we really have a great embedded position with some products, which are growing, as you say, sort of by expansion of the usage in a platform. And then we have products that we have introduced that are growing by expansion of platforms. So actually, we see both when you look at our results in wealth. So in credit in our core income, in our tech income products, what we're really seeing there is increased adoption. That is more FAs and more clients using the product. So this is the virtuous circle we're on a lot of platforms and we've delivered great results for those investors. And so we have more FAs understanding how this is a really effective part of essentially a core allocation, and our product works really well for them. And so in the case of credit, I think you're seeing primarily the growth of user increases, more FAs, more customers. And of course, the beauty of that is this is still so limited in its penetration. When you really dive into the details, which obviously, we do on what's really being sold in the platform, how many people are using it how many clients does each FA that uses it and have involved, you get very excited about forward look in this opportunity set, which you can also see from the macro numbers when we just look at penetration of alts in general versus this very, very large world called retail, call it private wealth or you want to slice it. So we're seeing the virtuous circle of being a market leader in that credit platform at a very early participants and having, frankly, really, really great results. Real estate is a bit more of a study in the benefits. In this case, you get twofold benefits. Ultimately, become [indiscernible] credit, which is to become more about deeper and deeper penetration. Today, we're still even in the early stages of this increased platforms. So we -- this year, we'll be adding quite a number of platforms in real estate and we're seeing the benefits of that as we bring this product onto new platforms. It's given us whole new audiences. Remember, this is a product where we're delivering a 7% tax advantage return current plus appreciation with triple net leases on generally investment-grade, creditworthy counterparties. It's a really special product and consider this is a time when in real estate, most people are delivering negative returns and are having negative flows, we're growing and adding. So I think you have both actually perfectly well studied. And listen, any given month, any given quarter, but the trend line is crystal clean, right, which is we are continuing to see significant growth in wealth as a part of our platform and the continuously offer products and really zeroing in on because we always have episodic moments that we bring products like GP Solutions where you go on for a while and then you come back off of a platform. So we really feel good about wealth. And one other comment just while we're on it, and it's not about wealth, it's just about product in general. You take April, as you said. So in April, we raised $1 billion in these continuously offer products. And I think something that gets lost sometimes in a lot of the discussion and not -- I'm sure people appreciate it. But not all dollars are created equal. And just take a step back and when you raise $1 billion in kind of high quality, high value-added products that we do, which we get appropriately paid for. You square that against dollars raised. There's a lot of very commoditized products that all managers raise, and that's fine. People do all different strategies. As you know, our focus has been very much a high value-added product. But if you take a step back and think about what we earn on something like $1 billion in continuously offer products relative to, say, a highly commoditized product that we see people raising capital for, that literally can be the equivalent of needing to raise $10 billion in a commoditized insurance-like product. We're highly commoditized fixed income kind of products. So $1 billion in April, but quite literally, mathematically, it could be the equivalent of $10 billion of what many other people raise these days. So I think that is lost in this conversation about it's not as well. That's just about nature of product and get sorry to go off on that side track. But I think it's an important point also when we talk about the nature of dollars raised. Absolutely. So look, spreads -- so let's start with this. Yes, there's been spread compression, point of fact. There was spread expansion a year ago, 1.5 years ago. Before that, spreads were tighter. I look over the long arc of time that we have done now about $100 billion or so in originations. And it's no doubt the case that spreads go up and spreads come down. The key to our business is something really distinctive about private credit done right. Again, we are deeply focused on credit, credit, credit, principal preservation, downside protection and strong income results. And that has worked. We're running at a 7 basis point realized loss rate. So everything about doing this strategy, right, growing our business, which, of course, grows our fee-based is about delivering on the credit promise where we have been best of breed. And so the key to us, unlike many alternative products, let's call them the high octane products were vintage is a big question, you get in at the right time to get out at the right time great returns. But see, if you get into the wrong equity product in 2021 and now you're sitting here today with a couple of years just dead time behind you, you're probably going to struggle with returns. The big difference for us is unlike kind of entry moment in entry and exit moment. I think about this more as a box, a range, a ban. The key is, do we have really strong credits and are we getting an attractive return, attractive spread for those credits? And here's the good news on the corollary to our spreads compressed, have compressed. Is it attractive? Absolutely. Absolutely. The credit that we are seeing and the return you're earning, Remember, we're in a 532, 90-day LIBOR. So when you take spreads, it's I prefer the 100 basis points wider spreads than we were seeing 1.5 years ago. But the spreads we're seeing today aren't that different from what we saw 3 years ago, and those were really attractive loans and returns too. So I'm not being dismissive, we'll always prefer a higher spread, but that isn't. What matters to us is a band in which we're earning a very good return for a very moderated risk. And we're certainly operating in that band and feel good about it. As to FRPR, I mean we're in a pretty tight band, but I'll turn that over to Alan. Thanks, Glenn. And it's a great question. First, I want to reinforce, we indeed consider ourselves credit animals. Thank you for that. I like that one. With regard to the range of offerings, you characterize well, we certainly have built out adjacencies that take us from diversified direct lending, that led us, of course, a long time ago now to understanding the great merits of software lending, which has really worked it led us to first lien lending another derivative thereof that's really worked. We now have, as you point out, with our new acquisitions with Prima. We add -- it's very strong rated real estate oriented debt at a time when that market is deeply disrupted with Kuvare. We add, of course, other adjacent investment grade or stronger credit derivative opportunities. So we definitely have widened that range and we like that. To answer your question very spot on, we have some parts of alternative credit very strongly. -- as we've commented, but I'll share the skin, beneath the surface, we actually do a lot of lending in areas people don't particularly share of our large business may not focus on, but we have developed very strong skills in railcar leasing -- in aircraft leasing in ABL finance with Wingspire in life settlements in royalties in health care, as you pointed out, we've done about $13 billion of loans. So there's a lot we have built organically, and we will continue to utilize that capability for both our diversified products and over time as appropriate in other specialized or asset-backed products. So we have the organic tools. Are there other areas to put it rhetorically, that we could add in an alternative credit or asset-based credit, absolutely true. So we continue to look at build, buy and they're neither mutually exclusive nor mutually required, which is to say we've got a lot of tools to be successful in asset-based finance. We would be perfectly open to and interested in adding more tools and we have our eyes open for that. Yes. Yes, thank you. Look, it is our favorite topic, as we talk about all the time, which is continued path to the dollar dividend. And sitting here today, we continue to feel the same way. We are moving right forward being in and around that dollar. And every quarter where we march forward up into the right to quote, I think, Glen's title or the Blue Street continues, I think, to use yours. We move a quarter closer and the band effectively gets tighter. When we complete steps of these, and it's not enormously complicated ladder or set of steps. But when we get things done, like this quarter, we said, look, we expect it will include strategic acquisition as part of it. We did two this last quarter. We expect we'll take other BDCs or some of them public over time. We did that with BDC, which is trading really well. And meantime, BDC trades at a premium to book. So we're slowly ticking it off in the sort of I'm going to compile and I'll also add Brennen's title as well. We think we are the boring Blue Street moving up and to the right. So I think I've merged with proper attribution, 3 titles together. And that the destination, the goal is to get to that dollar, and we continue to feel good about being in and around that level. So let me turn it over to Alan to give you the building blocks to go with that. Sure. So let me just take one step back and frame our business has a very, very clear DNA, right? We focus on a being very deep in an adjacent and tightly bound sound of products. And we've talked about this about for before, but there's different strategies. There's the -- all directions on the Compass strategy and many of our very successful peers pursue that strategy, picture what we're doing as a northbound highway. It's got a lot of lanes. In the lanes we occupy, we intend to be the leader or a leader. We're clearly well leader in triple net lease, the leader in GP Stakes, a leader in Direct Lending, a couple of other cars, but pretty -- that makes we're pretty uncrowded commute when there's just a few cars in the lane. And then we've added some other thesis there are direct adjacency's, and you know on the exact infrastructure question. So Prima and insurance, Kuvare offer 2 quite different additions to our capability set. So look, we're in real estate, and we're in credit and we have certainly launched for a very long time as to when we could do real estate credit. Well, not too hard to figure out contingency of that statement. And we've said it on these prior calls before. Here's the history with real estate credit. We, as a credit firm, of course, has been to approach all the time with I think we've now looked at close to 10,000 different loans. And certainly, we've been approached about real estate loans. And the phenomenon we have for years and years is we would be willing to do the work in our current diversified products in the area, we could do real estate is a piece of it. But every time we put in doing the credit work on what was behind the leases, what was behind the credit, we ended up seeing like-for-like, the spreads were way tighter and leverage higher than a comparable direct corporate law. So we didn't do it. And I don't know at the time, we always said to each other, I don't understand what you say the word real estate. All of a sudden, it's supposed to be at a tighter spread. Well, loan hall is not. It turns out, it's not. And here we are now where the market has become very disruptive, and it becomes a very interesting point for us to bring our skills in real estate and credit into this highly disrupted market and by bringing Fremont board who are really good at this. And remember, again, this is a very focused strategy. Prima does something, single asset, single borrower focus, risk retention, really good at it. This is much higher grade product. So they have a very good book. We're not spending time thinking about, gee, what is the workout going to look like in real estate as almost any real estate lender would. So that's a wonderful addition. We're using M&A in a sort of strategic and tactical way to add some terrific skills that we can build off organically. So that's a filling of a really nice capability product and team. Insurance, think about that as horizontal, right? We have successfully become a leader in delivering institutional solutions, institutional fund raising, wealth, where we're a market leader. The one we've been missing is insurance, deliver and solutions properly packaged properly structured for the insurance user. Remember, we always talk about this. We don't have different products for different people. We have different entry ramps, we customize the structures, we customize and continuous solve our product because individual investors value some of that flexibility. It's different from what institutions value, so we customize their product. Now with Kuvare, we've added some complementary capabilities. But most importantly, we now have a way of customizing the solution for that user of capital. So now we have the third core leg of the stool. We now have wealth and we have institutional and we have insurance. So think about that as horizontal, taking our capabilities. And again, our product suite is particularly well suited to the insurance user. And now we have the abilities to bring that bundle together and deliver the solutions to not compete with the insurance industry. So I would say those two, you can see are quite different. One adds a capability right in our sweet spot. One is horizontal. It's not really about adding new products. It's about adding a way to deliver those products in a way that's perfectly packaged for its users. So last to the FT article, I mean I can't control their the title and the poised infrastructure is a little disproportionate. It's just compatible what we've observed before, which is when we think about our products, which is downside protection with strong predictable returns, generally current income inflation protection that brings you very naturally to a few areas. It brings you to at the right moment, something like real estate credit, okay? Well, we have our foothold there. It brings you to things like asset-based lending, and we just talked about that. We have a lot of organic capabilities, and we'll have an eye on both organic and inorganic possibilities there. And to our way, another example would be infrastructure. I don't do anything in infrastructure or not. Again, I think the emphasis is a bit excessive with the title -- but I think if you read through the article or kind of incorporate it with what I'm about to say, it's a natural area that's adjacent for us because it's a space that is about lower risk, principal preservation, strong returns and income orientation, and that could either be in the infrastructure debt or infrastructure equity. And so I view that as more an example of how we can stay very tight to our strategy. Do what we do well, understand our DNA well, but do it in an adjacent product. whether we do that or not, it's not as if, okay, next up. I think it's more about an example of how we think about the world strategically, which is to stay very deep in a very, very tightly balanced strategically aligned side of products. Sure. And Alan, I can probably comment on it, but let me start with the headline. Look, we do floating rate debt that is our business for our investors. And that is mathematically definitionally means when rates are higher, the absolute returns for our investors are on average higher. And when rates are lower, on average, they'll be a little bit lower. Sitting here today, and look, there's a lot of things we've been right about and wrong about and that will continue to be true. But I will say that a year ago, and everyone on this call probably can check us on this one, we have been talking about the higher for longer case for quite a long time. And we see it through our portfolio. Remember, we have almost 400 companies that we lend money to, and we study them and work with them very, very closely. And what we have seen consistently for the last year and still today, is inflation has not gone away. Now that's a consensus view. It seemed like a only voice in the words a year ago, even 4 months ago, we don't have this conversation when the world was talking about 7 rate cuts. Now we're in a world where it's somewhere balanced between 0 rate cuts and 1 right back to the new consensus. And that's a reality of what's happening from the ground up. We see wage pressures continue. You see cost pressures continue. Importantly, we see all these companies raising their prices. Someone's paying for that. So when you add it all together, inflation is not, of course, is not ranging the way it was 1.5 years ago, it's very real. So look, that does bring us to the higher for longer view from the ground up or not macro experts. But as a result of that, in a higher-for-longer world, which now seems pretty likely, of course, that does flow through in ever higher returns for our investors and to agree FPR. Remember, what's really important, though, other than the small amount of variance around fee related, which is not the RPR, which is a modest part of our revenue base. You have to remember, we at Blue Holland you know this, but I'm saying it more broadly, we have Blue Owl paid fees to manage the business. There's no carry. We have no capital markets fees. We don't have all these other variable fees that other people have to manage, which is complicated. Our business is very straightforward. And even with gyrations in spread or whether we do have a rate cut, don't have a rate cut, really, really moderate impacts on our business. So I'm going to let Alan comment on that, and then I'll come back to the credit question you had, and it's the case. And then let me tack back on to the credit question and attack it a couple of ways. First of all, and I said this before, within the land of our credit business, credit is everything. It's what we focus on. It's what we're focused on from day 1. It's why we focus on the large end of the market. It's why we focus so intensely on low loan to values, which in our portfolio, they remain on average in the 40s. So we're -- and in software lower, our portfolio performance. You look at our -- we look at our most recent results, on average, the EBITDA and revenue in our portfolio companies grew on average in the last quarter that we just finished our data analysis on at double digits. So we understand and of course, we're always thinking about, gee, the credit downturn, which is really economic downturn right? -- separate thing called the credit downturn unless you do credit poorly, and I feel confident we haven't done that. And so at the end of the day, we're still growing robustly in our portfolio on average. Of course, there's going to be peculiar credit issues. Of course, there's companies that have their own peculiar challenges. But remember, our nonaccruals are well below 1% of our book. And our loss rate historically now has been at 7 basis points per year. So I think we're starting from an incredibly good place. And here's I guess 2 things to take away from that. We care intensely about credit. As an investor in the Blue Owl stock, they'll again, remember, we could pay fees to manage these funds. So ultimately, that's not really a question that bears on the shareholder of Blue Owl in any meaningful way, matters to us and it matters grow a lot to our LPs, and that's what we work for every single day. So we're intensely focused on it, but it's not really an earnings question. Last point, I think this is what also gets lost in the conversations about credit. I absolutely do get and agree that people -- we can say, Hey, we just don't know because there's this new thing called private credit, not so new and it hasn't been fully tested well pass on through with test, but it is a good way of just creating for those who wish to uncertainty. There's a lot of data, a lot, right? I just told you our data on nearly $100 billion of loans, and it hasn't exactly been sailing to the land of COVID and wars and runs on banks. And again, it hasn't been a deep dark recession. But actually, the tar recessions have happened in the land of leveraged credit. This isn't new. We're making loans to the same companies, except with tighter documents and lower loan to values that the syndicated market did back in the 2000s, and we actually do know what that looks like. And frankly, if it was that -- even that bad, so to speak, think about the returns. We're starting with unlevered returns today, depending on, again, which spread we're all using 10% to 12%. You can take pretty meaningful changes in defaults and still have one heck of a risk return. So we think about it all the time. But I really think this sort of propensity of say, this market is just on test. It actually is extremely well tested. It just hasn't been tested, frankly, in this more durable format. And I think what you will find. When that test comes in this exact format, I think you're going to find out that loan losses are lower. Because you have parties in bilateral arrangements with very aligned incentives, which is, you know what, we all want this company to do well. We all want this company to thrive and pay back its capital, burn games, there are tricks the aren't credit default swaps. There aren't credit on creditor violence, all that stuff will happen in the syndicated market. So yes, you'll live that stuff again in private credit, I would proffer that you're going to see a better experience when that version of days comes again. Sure. So I don't want to speak on behalf of Kuvare, the insurance company, which remember, we are buying the asset manager, and we're an asset manager, so balance sheet light provider of management services, and they are a really strong insurance originator. So that's their side of the equation. I don't mean that in a lack of partner way. We're very much partnered, but I want to understand that they are the insurance company, we are their partner asset manager. With that said, we know that, for example, last year, they grew their book by $5.6 billion. So part of this whole exercise was to get more capital freed up and focused on supporting the growth of their insurance company, including our $250 million preferred investment. So last year was $5.6 billion. They were looking for more capital to continue to grow and to grow, I think we'll continue to see very healthy growth. They have a great origination business. I've mentioned this before, but they punch way above their weight. Here's a firm of a size that is in the Japanese market, which is one of the most discerning markets, as I understand it, for these types of annuity products. And they're right in there with the very biggest and the very best. And I think it's a real credit to what they've done on the insurance origination and management side. So I won't forecast their number for them, but I think it is safe to say that given the growth they've had in the past, we expect to see that kind of growth continues, that's why they want the capital. Yes. And remember, we now require the whole of their asset management business, which means we do have all the product capabilities built out. That you just described. So with this brings to us the ability to deliver the comprehensive solution, you just postulated about others. So we do have all that now. Our focus isn't on the low fee products. But we have the capabilities now and it's not like we just missed having matter just having the comprehensive set of solutions. It will be part of our growth profile going forward, too. So we do have that full range today. In terms of the addressable market, it's actually a really interesting question. We all know this is evolving in the interrelationship between insurance and asset management or alternative asset managers. And there's different models, I don't think there's one singular right model. I will say that our model is built around staying very focused on being really good at asset management and letting insurance companies to be really good at insurance and being a partner to them as opposed to a competitor with them, which is very consistent with our model. We are a capital solutions provider with the picks and shovels, right? We do that. We provide capital solutions to GPs themselves with our GP solutions business, help them grow their businesses. We provide capital solutions to corporate owners of real estate to help them grow their businesses. We provide financing solutions to PE portfolio companies. And now with our below strategic equity, we provide GP Continuation Capital. All of those are solutions to, for example, a private equity firm, not competition with the private equity firm. So I think we've got a very clear focus and same thing in insurance. We are now -- we are their partner, and we're here to help them grow and not try to take growth from them. Sure. Well, let me start with this observation on every acquisition we make, our mission is to have a best-of-class team as a part of that, and we have that with Prima, which also means first job is to make sure we only enhance doing well at they already do, we once combined. And that's been true. Look at our Oak Street business, now the real estate business. That's a business that has thrived because they're great at what they do, again, now we, but is phrasing, I'm purposely trying to be intentional about this idea of not ever disrupted only enhancing the investment process. So our first job is to continue to do a fantastic job for Prima LPs in the products they have. Now with their capabilities and ours, there are opportunities for us to deliver great results to their existing or new LPs and do so well for our shareholders. When you think about where we'll go, remember we also have now brought on a world-class real estate finance professional, Jesse Hom. Jesse Hom, who is quite well known in the world of real estate finance, having led this at GIC will be joining us to lead this overall initiative. So Prima comes on board, we'll keep doing Prima really well. And then we will extend -- to answer your question, again, remember our DNA and our comfort, our idea is to go into a market and find ways to take risk out and are really attractive, stable returns. So that would tend towards leaning our mindset, not toward opportunistic stress let's go find a messy office building rather it, hey, this is a dysfunctional market now. We can go in and do very high-quality things that are much lower leverage, much less deep in the cap stack and earn a very active return providing that capital. So I think that frame of reference is likely to be more where we live than all of a sudden trying to move out to the periphery of return seekers, that's not our mission. Our mission is to have sleep at night well money for our investors and deliver really good returns for it. That is exactly right at exactly what we focus on and exactly where I think we've developed now, I'd say, our muscles to do it well. We think integration is critical. And that is part of -- again, the benefit here is don't disrupt anything about the strong investment performance and practices of businesses but enhance them with the intellectual capital and capabilities that we have, bring the backbone that we have operationally to each of these companies to help support them doing an even better job at the investment business. I want to make sure we say this. We've talked a lot about M&A on here. The vast preponderance of our growth is organic. And the M&A is actually pretty moderate when you get down to a number of people, impact on business. I just talked about Prima. It's a wonderful business. It comes with a wonderful team. It does something very specific, though. It's not this isn't some grand complex integration. Actually, it's pretty straightforward. And that's not to take it lightly. It's just to say we to distinguish between complicated integrations and acquisitions, not something that we pursue with any great vigor and relatively simple ones like a Prima. So an acquisition is not an acquisition in the generic set. That said, I think we feel very, very good about our pathway. And let me just point back to real estate. So Oak Street, when we acquired Oak Street now our real estate business, I believe it had about $70 million in FRE. And today, we're running at about $200 million of FRE. Triple. Tripled that business. And Marc Zahr and his team and Chair and others have been phenomenally effective as an integrated part of this firm. Michael Reiter, who comes in as operational integrates to our operations that has been an absolutely case study for us in how we can do this. And so we learn our lessons. Again, we're not saying we're perfect by any measure. But I think we feel very, very good that we can handle these acquisitions, and we'll be very, very careful as we look and we'll continue to look at organic and inorganic growth, but let's not lose track of the fact that most of our growth has been and likely will be organic growth up and to the right, the boring Blue Street up to the right. Great. Thank you all very much. Really appreciate the time and your patience and your interest, and we're going to go away and be credit animals and try to do some more boring quarters for you. But we do appreciate it very much and back to it. Thank you."
